[00:00:03.650] - Thei Zervaki
Hello, I'm Thei Zervaki, and today I'm going to talk to you about strategic social media makeover using artificial intelligence and human design. I'm Thei, and I'm a linguist, translator, and interpreter based in Seattle. I also have a full blog. That's why I'm here with you at that summit. I use also different tools like human design and astrology to create content easily, the easy way, let's say, whenever I can. Okay, let's go. The plan for the day. I'm going to talk to you about social media today and why we do care for social media, or maybe we don't. What is human design and how we can use it for your content creation? And the use of AI as a tool to create, engage with social media content fast. Okay, let's talk a little bit about social media and why we love to hate social media. I'm sure that most of you know all the statements I'm going to read that I collected throughout the last few months. We don't have the luxury not to be on social media. We need to get off social media sites because they're toxic. You have to be visible, let people know what you're up to and be discovered on social media.

[00:01:29.020] - Thei Zervaki
Social media is neither negative It's the positive, it's the energy who attached to it. Social media can be around. We don't decide, the algorithm does. Finally, you never know who is going to see you on social media and what doors will open for you. I don't know if you agree or disagree with those, but in any case, all the statements are legit. The first and the second that they contradict each other, we don't have the likes to not to be. The other one says, Oh, you have to get off social media because they're so bad. You have to be visible, you are discovered. It's all about being found online. A lot of people talk about randomness of social media. It's the algorithm that decides. I like the blue. The fourth on this page, social media is neither negative or positive. It's the energy we're attached to it, and this is what I believe about social media. Now, am I consistent in social media? No, I'm not. For the same reasons as everybody else. It's a lot of work. It's not paid work, really. You never know what is going to happen with that work. Some of that type disappears immediately.

[00:02:35.370] - Thei Zervaki
The next couple of hours, other posts, they stay there for a longer time. I'm myself a little bit confused. That's why I try to employ tools that make the process of social media creation easier. Now, because I told you I have a food blog, I don't like Instagram because mainly Instagram is very visual and there's a lot of competition. All the food bloggers are there. You have to compete with 5 million other food bloggers together with professional chefs, mystery chefs, and restaurant owners, coffee shop owners, and bakers. I don't actually like it. I am very consistent on Pinterest, which technically is not a social media platform. It's more like a search engine. I see the evolution and the progress, even if it's slow. It is slow progress, but I can see it. The more I post on a Pinterest, the more traffic I get, the more impressions I get, the more saved I get, the more clicks I get. I see something's moving on on Pinterest and I like it. Does it take time to create all those pins? Does It does. But I found a system, I batch it, I use pamphlets, so I make it easier for me.

[00:03:53.170] - Thei Zervaki
But again, Pinterest is not social media. It's a search engine. It's slightly different. Now, there is no a small size fits all approach for social media. That's why also different. Some people, they use all the social media platforms. They're everywhere. Instagram, threads, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest even. Others, they pick one. I'm only on LinkedIn. I told you, I'm a translator and interpreter. I use LinkedIn for that part of my business and try to be consistent and be on LinkedIn one or twice a week. It's actually quite helpful. People see me, I get job offers or project offers rather. It works for me. But again, am I consistent all the time? No, I'm not. Do I show up every day? No, I don't. That will continue being. This is The main thing I want you to think a little bit about. What you need to find out is what you're going to be known for in life in general, but in social media, specifically for this presentation. Because if you don't know what you're going to be known for, you can't really create any content on social media. You have to, Okay, why am I going to be discovered?

[00:05:04.580] - Thei Zervaki
Why I want people to find me? Or what for I want people to find me on social media? Am I the top-notch food blogger that I make amazing, three layer cakes, and this is how I want to be known on social media? Or I am the top-notch travel blogger that I create content about South American countries that people travel, and I want to be known for that expertise. You have to find what you're going to be known for social media, what is your expertise. Then based on that, you can decide what type of content you're going to create and what are your content pillars. Think of content pillars like your categories. Go to your blog and find your top three categories and then decide if this is what you're going to post about on Instagram, Facebook, and any other platform you do post. Okay, now let's talk a little bit about human design. Human design is the pseudoscience, as people think. It's a spiritual, intuitive tool that you may or may not like. It's not science. I'm very clear about that. It's more like a modern, a complex system grounded in ancient tools and practices, including the Astrology, the tractor system, the Chinese Ai Qi and Kabala.

[00:06:18.410] - Thei Zervaki
At the center of human design, there are four energy types that provide insights into our individuality and how we interact with the world. You can see human design as a roadmap to discover who you are, your precise uniqueness, strengths, gifts, and traits. You can use human design every day for business, marketing, content creation, communications, relationships, and so on. Human design has been developed by Alan Robert Krakower, following an alleged mystical experience in Spain in the late '80s. He then published the book The Human Design System under the pseudonym Raúl Hú in 1992, and he's known as Ra in the world of human design. Ra died in 2011, so he's not alive right now, but he left a whole huge intellectual property estate that most of it is hosted on Jovian Archive, with a lot of information, programs, courses, books, et cetera. It's not the only one that is available. There are a lot of online human design schools and systems and books, and there are a lot of human design consultants, and you can find anything you want online. One thing to know, human design is very complex. It's not something that you can learn very easily, and it takes a lot of years of practice and studying and all those things.

[00:07:40.300] - Thei Zervaki
I actually find out human design in the late '90s, but I haven't done much about that since then. I rediscovered in about 2015, and I slowly started to study basically everything I could find online for free because I have to say the human design classes are really expensive. A lot of free information online articles, books, YouTube, videos, and so on. Then after a while, I started taking classes and invest a little bit more on human design. But I also study astronomy for a very long time, since I was a teenager, with a lot of many famous astrologists in different astrologists schools. I'm with that type of area and of expertise, let's say. Although I never turned that into a full-time career, I always use it as a side, tool project, and I work with the clients for readings and applications for that. Let's move on now and find out how you're going to create your chart. You need to do your chart for free. Your human design chart, the basic one, is free. Now, if you want to have a most sophisticated, complicated chart, you have to pay. But the free one is fine for this presentation, and you don't need more than that, really.

[00:08:53.970] - Thei Zervaki
I did the two charts I created for this presentation. There are two avatars I'm going to use. I created the chart of Joven Archive website, which looks like that. You need to know, as I said, the date of birth, the time of birth, and the location of birth. In this case, our first avatar is Jennifer, also known as Jan, born in July 15, 1979, at 9:15 in the morning in Chicago. When you see that chart, you see different things here. You see the body in the middle, which just looks like a chakra system, which it is. You see numbers right and left, red and black, arrows, and information on top about type, definition strategy, profile, inner authority, not self-theme, and incarnation cross. Now, for this presentation, we only care for the type and the strategy. Jennifer was a projector, and the strategy was to wait for the invitation. The type is your energetic field looks like and what it does, and the strategy is how to use it energy for a life-release resistance. There are four different types in human design. Basically, all of us, the humans, are divided into four types. Each one does different things.

[00:10:10.190] - Thei Zervaki
The whole idea is to embrace your type and embody your type. If you do, life is a little bit easier. The generators are manifesting generators, two types under one, basically, they both have the same strategy to respond. They make 70% of the population. You're most likely to be a generator, manifesting generator. The strategy is to respond, which means to respond to what people want and provide solutions. The generators or manifesting generators are actually the people here who do things. The doers, the builders, the producers, the creators that have a lot of energy and they're super productive. Then, yes, they respond to what people want and they provide solutions. Famous generators, Oprah Winfrey, Jlo, Madonna, the creative types that work all all the time. Oprah once, I think she was given an interview and she was talking about her life, saying, I have a day job, I have a morning job, an afternoon job, an evening job. She keeps working all the time. The manifesting generators are slightly different. On top of that, they're also super efficient and they're multitaskers. Everybody needs a manifesting generator in their team because those people are really good to juggle different projects.

[00:11:27.310] - Thei Zervaki
They're multitasking and they have an incredible energy. Think of Elon Musk, from Teslas to the space to, I don't know what else he's doing, AI now, social media platforms. Tony Robbins, how many workshops he has done so far in his life? How many books he wrote the last 30 years, he's doing what he does. You can do it. You can do it. Steven King, how many books he wrote, Steven King? I don't even know. I lost track. Let's move to the next type, which is the projectors. 21% of the population are projectors, and the strategy is to wait for the invitation. I will explain what that means. Projectors are here to guide us. They're the experts, the guides, the advisors. They make amazing coaches and consultants and helpers, and they are natural teachers too. They have the amazing ability to see things clearly and to show us a new way of success. Now, wait for the invitation does not mean that you sit and wait. That truly means is to go out and about and be seen in the world. And then the world, when they see you, they invite you in their life. Famous projector, Barack Obama.

[00:12:41.560] - Thei Zervaki
Do you think Barack Obama would ever be elected as a president if he was just waiting for the invitation? No. He was out and about, and he was seen, and he was talking and engaging with people. And one day, he was nominated for the presidency, and the rest is history. Princess Diana, same thing. She She wasn't waiting to be invited to the royal family. She claimed the invitation on her own, on her own right. Next group, manifestors, 8% of the population. Those are the people who are the trailblazers and that they like to get things started. They're here to inform and to initiate that strategy. They initiate things, but they are not necessarily into the all doing things. They just bring new ideas into life. They like to innovate. They are the visionaries, the trend setters, and they thrive when they do things on their own terms in their own way. As I said, they don't necessarily do the whole thing. They inform, they initiate, they set the trend, They send you off with all of ideas and innovations and whatever else they're going to initiate, but they don't necessarily finish everything off. Manifestors also work in cycles.

[00:13:58.650] - Thei Zervaki
Like Adele is a A good example of that. They work and they perform and they do what they do, but then they disappear for some time. Like Adele, she creates an amazing album, she was on tour for six months, and then you don't see her for the next 12 months. It's not that they do nothing in that time. It's just they don't want to be seen. They work behind the scenes, they rest, they recharge, and they work on the next project, right? But they're not out and about. And the final group, the reflectors, 1% of the population strategy to wait for the Lunas cycle. Because people are the natural empaths, they take in and mirror the energy that is surrounded around them, and they can offer a powerful objective assessment of any environment they're in. So the Lunas cycle, I don't know if you know about this, but the lunar cycle takes 28 days for a lunar cycle, basically. From the new moon to the full moon is 14 days, and from the next full moon to the next new moon, another 14. So they follow that. Famous reflector, Sandra Bullock, Rosalind Carter. I never met a reflector, as far as I know.

[00:15:09.840] - Thei Zervaki
Probably I met, but I didn't know that I met. But 1% of the population is really small compared to the 70%, but still, there are quite a few reflectors out there. I haven't many one as far as I know, though. If you're a reflector, let us know who you are, how is to be a reflector these days and how you function. Okay, now let's move to the next. The first practical example I'm going to share with you, I'm going to do two. I'm going to try to rush because I don't have too much time for this presentation. Jennifer sees a projector and the strategy is to just wait for the invitation. Let's create a prompt by picking our favorite AI tool in this case. You pick your favorite AI tool. I'm not going to tell you which one. I used ChatGPT, the free version of ChatGPT for this one because I want everybody to try the same. If you want to, you can use Gemini, you can use Claude, you can use Perplexity. There are so many these days. Then once you pick your favorite AI tool, you assign it a role. In this case, I said to the tool when I prompt it, You are my social media content creator now.

[00:16:19.780] - Thei Zervaki
Then I create the instructions, which is actually known as prompts. This is a long one. I think this is probably about 160 words or something like that, even more maybe. Jennifer is a beauty blogger, and this is how I describe the blog. My blog is a beauty blog that provides content on minimalistic beauty and skincare for Gen X women, 46 to 65 years old in the US. That includes product reviews, product launches, and trends in this beauty category. My target audience are Gen X women who want to maximize their results by reducing cost and time. This is a very good description of what the blog does and what the target audiences of the blog are. Jennifer is very clear about this, right? Minimalistic beauties, skincare for Gen X women, what the blog reviews and talks about and what the target audience are and what they want. The other code or prompt I included, and you don't have to do that if you don't want to, I said that the respond will engage voice as the social media content creator on a medium-sized blog, beauty blog. Give me details and examples and feel free to share your opinion.

[00:17:36.520] - Thei Zervaki
Use tables and graphs when delivering content strategies. You don't have to call that if you don't want to, or you can create your own. You can ask AI to give you whatever you want from AI. Now the green highlight here is exactly what we want the human design and AI to do together with our content pillars. Develop a content creation workflow for Instagram that aligns with my human design time of a projector in my strategy to go ahead for the invitation. For this one, the social media atlant is IG, it's Instagram. My content pillars on educational post readers, a day in the life of a skincare beauty creator, and cutting-edge skincare tools. Three content pillars for this case, right? Educational post, a day in the life of a beauty creator, and cutting-edge skincare tools. Build a table with seven days of content ideas, focusing on Instagram reels, carousels, and stories as the primary types of content. That's actually a good prompt to use. If you don't want seven days, you can five days or 14 days or three days, whatever you want. Seven is a good chunk of content that you're going to get. You can split in different days if you don't want to post every day for seven days.

[00:18:52.580] - Thei Zervaki
That's the general information that they gave me, ChatGPT. For Jen's Instagram strategy, focusing on Minimalistic Beauty and Skincare for Gen X women, it's crucial to present content that resonates with your audience's desires for effective yet simple solutions. As a projector, Jen's content should position her as a guide who introduces insightful tips and trends, invite your audience to learn and engage on a deeper level. You see, we talked that projectors make good guides, and ChatGPT got it immediately. Here is a detailed seven-day Instagram content plan that leverages the strengths of a projector in human design, focus on educational posts, the day in the life, and the latest skincare tools. Now, it's a lot of information here, people, so I have to rush and be fast. For day one, the content type is real, and the topic is quick morning skincare from busy Gen Xers So you create like a reel video. Showcase a simple quick morning skincare routine using minimal products that deliver results. Use before and after skin visuals. Cta, the call to action, top save if you're trying this tomorrow. I like that. Good idea. Day 2, Carousel. Top three skincare tools for women over 40.

[00:20:05.220] - Thei Zervaki
Very good. Introduce tools like LED masks, microcaron devices, and Sony cleansers, detailing their benefits for my true skin. Each slide can focus on one tool, CTA. Which tool are you curious about? Comment below. Very good. You do what you do and you have all the CTAs and the comment below call to action. Very, very good. So day three, story and poll together. Choose our next review. That's very good for a story. Review two or three products and use a poll to let followers decide which one Jen should review next. This builds engagement by involving them in content creation. It's call to action. What for the product you're going to ask to explore next. That's a very good idea. That gives you some clues about your audiences about what products they like. Day 4, make it real. Decode Serum ingredients. That's advanced. Explain common ingredients in serums ideal for Gen X skin, like hyaluronic acid and retinol. Use clear, concise language and visual. Cta, DM us your favorite serum and why? Amazing. Day 5, carousel. Five minimalistic beauty tips for maximum impact. Share tips and simplify beauty routines while maximizing skin health and esthetics such as multi-purpose product or overnight treatments.

[00:21:23.710] - Thei Zervaki
Call to action. Which tip are you going to try? Let us know. I find that the five, maybe it's too much information. Maybe you should do a three instead of five. Maybe five is a lot. If you have time, you can do five, but you can do three and another three next week, for example. Day six, the real evening routine for optimal skin repair, another real. You demonstrate an effective night routine focused on rejuvenation and hydration featuring 2-3 key products. Cta, save this rule for your night routine. Very good idea. Two to three products is fine. And the day seven, stories a question, ask me anything skincare edition. In this case, the suggestion is to host an ask me anything, where Jen will answer a follow-up questions about skincare challenges, products, and techniques. This position Jen as an approachable expert and builds community. Engagement strategy, use questions, stickers to collect questions throughout the week in your stories, probably, and then answer them in a story series. Okay, I have to sip a little bit of coffee. In this case, if you find that you like some more than others, you have a choice. What you can do, you can pick, let's say, the three ones that you like the best.

[00:22:46.340] - Thei Zervaki
Let's say that you like one reel, one story, poll and one carousel, and you can put it back on your AI tool stating that those three are my favorite suggestions based on my prompt. Create more of the same suggestions. In other words, create more carousels, more story and poll and more reels. Or you can formulate it according to your own language on what you want AI to create for you because maybe you don't like the ask me anything. Maybe you don't like to have too many carousels with five slides each time because it's too much for you. Then also seven days, you don't have to do seven days. I may be already told you, but you can do five, you can do three. Some people, they like to batch their content creation for social media, and they ask 14 days or 21 days. You get everything in one goal. You sit one day in front of your computer, get your AI, get your human design stuff. You put in there, and you ask 21 days for content creation. Then you take them and you put them the days that you like, not necessarily one day after the other.

[00:23:51.290] - Thei Zervaki
Some people are very good. They show up every day. Others, not so much. You don't have to show up every day if you don't want to, but you have to show consistency. I said that to myself, too. Okay, that's Jennifer, the beauty skincare blogger. Now, we're going to do another one, and this time of John. John was created. He was born in December 21st, 1989, at 9:15 PM in Miami, and he's a manifesting generator and his strategy is to respond. So John is a travel blogger, and his favorite social media platform is LinkedIn because his blog is a travel blog that provides content on destinations in the Caribbean Islands, targeting professional men and women, 45 to 65 in the US. That includes specific itineraries in the Caribbean, obviously, high-end resort and hotel reviews, as well as exclusive shopping ideas. My target audiences are women and men who have disposable income and want to indulge while traveling in the Caribbean. His blog is more like a high-end blog targeting a little bit older people, not Gen Z, not millennials, 45 to 65 Gen X and boomers, younger boomers. This is what he wants to focus on.

[00:25:10.560] - Thei Zervaki
The green highlight says, Develop a content creation workflow on LinkedIn. Com that aligns with my human design type of manifesting generator and my strategy to respond. My content pillars a high-end resort and hotels in the Caribbean, a day in the life of the Caribbean traveler, and the luxurious shopping in the Caribbean Islands. Build a table with seven days of content ideas, focus on LinkedIn text posts, video posts, audience posts, and articles as the primary types of content. In this case, LinkedIn, I don't know if you use LinkedIn, some of you, or not, allows text post, video post, image post, articles post. You can do a whole newsletter on LinkedIn if you want to, although I don't think newsletter is actually social media. You could do, what do you call them? One-liners. You just post one line, like a statement, and you leave it there, and people come and engage with you later on. We're going to see what ChatGPT created. I was a little bit disappointed with ChatGPT for this one, to be honest, because it didn't really explain if took into consideration. He said, Yeah, it's very simple. This is the content creation for John based on his human design type, but he didn't really precise that he is a manifesting generator and strategy is to respond.

[00:26:34.330] - Thei Zervaki
Okay, it's also a very good content plan for seven days, but it's too much information, in my opinion. I think John can use it in two weeks, really. For example, the first one is an article, and it's a long article of five luxury resorts in the Caribbean for 2024, the top five. Kick off with the detail article reviewing the best luxury resorts, including amenities, unique features, and why they stand out. That's actually a lot of work. The call to action is, which of these have you visited or planned to visit? Share your experiences. You don't have to do such a long article. You can do, let's say, the top one luxury resort according to the trends. We have one top-notch, a luxurious resort in the Caribbean, or maybe the top three. Five is too much information. You can do one every week if you want to. You can do two every week. It's a good idea, though, to review a luxury resort for your travel blog on social media because that gives a good information to your audiences. Day two, video post a day at the Hyatt Caribbean resort. Okay, that's really cool. You can do a video.

[00:27:44.090] - Thei Zervaki
You take your viewers through a day, the top-tier Caribbean Resort from breakfast buffet to spa treatment. Obviously, you have to ask for permission for that. I'm sure that the result wouldn't mind, but just in case, call to action, would you spend on a day like this? Let us know in the comment. Okay, Text post on day 3, Insider tips for luxury travel in the Caribbean. That's actually the video. All the Insider tips really do very well. Not only on social media, they do well everywhere. Really blog post, now Substack, even. Provide valuable tips for navigating the high-end aspects of Caribbean travel, such as the best time to visit for exclusivity, travel hub, etc. Cta, do you have any travel tips to add? Comment below. Now, we do a poll on number 4, Favorite Caribbean Island for Luxury Shopping. You ask your followers to vote for the Favorite Caribbean Island for Luxury Shopping. Then, as an engagement strategy, you follow up with a post discussing the most popular choice and what makes it special. Okay, that's actually a very good idea. Day 5, a video post, exclusive shopping in the Caribbean, what to buy and where.

[00:28:50.360] - Thei Zervaki
Basically, you do a video exploring a luxury shopping district in the Caribbean, highlighting local products, art, and jewelry. I think for this one, you should focus maybe on one or two. Shops on one specific island. You can go everywhere. I mean, the video will be long. Then, has CTA ever bought something special from the Caribbean? Sure, you find. Let's go, for example, let's say you're in Barbados and you do a video on a specific jewelry shop on Barbados. That's very specific. Day 6, text, post an image, spot-flying Caribbean culinary delights at five-star resorts. So your formation on gourmet dining options on a high-end Caribbean resorts, including photos, dishes and chef insights. CTA, which of these dishes would you like to try on your rest of vacation? Comment your choice. Again, it's long. You can pick one gourmet restaurant, high-end restaurant, all of them. The final day, they do an article Planning your Luxury Caribbean getaway, comprehensive guide. This is actually a guide. It's a long-form article that serves as a guide to plan on a luxury vacation in the Caribbean. I think this one, it should be more like an article about About Planning that is probably short.

[00:30:03.740] - Thei Zervaki
Then you can try to upsell your guide. So your guide, it should be the main product, not the freebie. Then you have a CTA, what's your top tip for to get away, grab your guide, grab my guide, and you direct them to your shop, Shopify shop, your website, whatever. This is a lot of information. The other thing I forget to tell you is that LinkedIn allows you to Instead of writing an article, you can share an article of a top-notch, in this case, travel magazine like Travel and Leisure, National Geographic, something like that. That's it, people. This is what I had to share with you. I hope you enjoyed this presentation and you got some ideas about what is human design and how you can use it for your content creation on social media. Obviously, I only take the type and the strategy. So call to action for my part, your homework otherwise known, pick your favorite social media platform, whatever it is, create your human design chart and focus on type and strategy for this part because it's only the beginning. I include my profile lines when I do that. This gives you way for more detailed information for your content creation and social media.

[00:31:23.990] - Thei Zervaki
Then pick your favorite AI tool and develop your prompts. Assign your AI tool and and develop your prompts as I highlighted here in yellow and green. Then you can download my resource guide somewhere here on that page. It's a simple resource guide with a curated list of articles, books, and websites about human design and social media, and some other information. Yet, I hope you find helpful. And that's all I had to tell you today. You got to find me, find me a hello at ninthhouseastrology.Com and at Threads, theiswords, which is the same name as Instagram, but I'm not really active on Instagram. So, threads@theiswords. Thank you so much. See you soon on the internet and somewhere on Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads. Have fun. Bye-bye.
