Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. I'm really excited for the session with Jeff Goins. Jeff, thank you so much for doing this. I appreciate you taking the time.

Jeff Goins [00:00:06]:
Thanks for having me, Elizabeth.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah. Because I've been a long time fan of yours. The person I came across you, you were speaking at my very first bincon back in 2015. it's where I picked up your book, The Art of Work, which is dog geared and has all sorts of things over line.

Jeff Goins [00:00:21]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:23]:
So thank you. I'm excited to have you and get to talk to you about creating content because you're so good at it. So -- Thank you. do you wanna, I mean, Obviously, you've written several books. You wanna just give everyone just a little bit on your background before we dive in?

Jeff Goins [00:00:35]:
Sure. I, am a best selling author of 5 books. soon to be 6. And, I've been doing this since 2010, really. I used to be a marketing director for a nonprofit. Now I write books and teach online courses for writers and creative entrepreneurs on how to succeed, and I Yeah. I I write and share ideas, basically.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:00]:
Yeah. because in the I'm gonna keep referencing it just because it's like I have -- Sure. -- great here, guys. It's great. You should pick it up. but I feel like in a lot of your writing, you tend to educate through great story calling. Mhmm. Mhmm. so how do you go about finding stories from either your life or a lot of times other people's lives to kind of teach.

Jeff Goins [00:01:24]:
So that was the first book where I really started using storytelling. as an important sort of, teaching tool. Okay. And I always appreciated author who did that, but I didn't know how to do it. Right? And, and so I started studying, and I learned a few things from some key mentors either directly or indirectly. I followed Ira Glass for a long time, and he has this great teaching series on YouTube. It's like a five part video series that was pulled from, I don't know, something on television or something. but it's about storytelling and that great quote that kind of became this viral phenomenon several years ago about taste and talent. You know, what no nobody ever tells you is that when you get into this, your taste exceeds your talent. And so that's why it doesn't feel good enough. that quote is from this series about storytelling, and it's a much longer series. And one of the things he says in this teaching series and how to tell a good story is The first thing that you need to understand about telling a good story is you have to find a good story and what makes, you know, this this American life, which is to show. So phenomenal he said is how many stories they throw out. So it's not that they're really it's not just that they're really good at telling stories. It's that they have understood how to identify a remarkable story. And that was something that I took to heart when I was writing that book, and you know, found some really interesting stories, including, the story of my friend, Ginny Pong, my now friend, Ginny Pong. I didn't know her before I wrote the book. Yeah. Who is the 1st Singaporean doula. Right? And so she has this fascinating story about coming into her life's work and describing it as slipping into an old pair of shoes is what it felt like. so I think that's kind of the first thing is a willingness to throw out a lot of bad stories or just not great stories. Right? and then, you know, the second thing that I learned was from Chris Gillevo. He wrote a book called the $100 startup which was kind of in the vein, you know, that I wanted to write there of work, stories of everyday people who had done something extraordinary that people could relate to. And I asked him how he found those stories. And he said, he goes, this might sound, you know, a little bad. But, you know, he said I found that the people who really want you to tell their stories, those aren't the stories you wanna tell. Right? The person who is like, pick me. Pick me. I have a great story. you know, they, they have a reason for that. Right? They have a platform that they're trying to establish or some message that they're trying to get out. And there's nothing wrong with that, but you wanna find the really interesting never heard before stories. And in order to do that, you have to find the people who in some ways are unwilling to tell their stories and get them to tell their story. And so what he told me was you don't wanna find the people who are offering to tell you their story wanna find the people who say, you need to talk to my cousin or my neighbor or this person that I heard about on on the local news or whatever. And, and so I I think that those two things were really helpful for me in figuring out how to tell you know, good stories. And then the other thing I learned just through experience was to tell a good story. You have to ask, to tell, like, a thorough story somebody else's story. Of course, you have to you have to get it from them a few times. You have to interview them multiple times.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:58]:
Okay.

Jeff Goins [00:04:58]:
And and I realized this is what Malcolm Gladwell does. He did a whole podcast with Tim Ferris on how he writes. And he will interview the the person whose story he wants to tell, like, 2 or 3 times Okay. And then he'll go over it again and again and again because the facts change, the details change, people tell their stories in different ways at different times to different people. And you just get more the second or third time, and you get different details. Right? I may tell your story And I want it to be a story about perseverance, but then we, you know, go through it a few times and I go, oh, no. This is more about, like, hope or something. You know? and so there's an angle here that I didn't quite know until I got to the end of it, a theme that I want to explore a little bit more, so I need to talk to you again to figure out without making stuff up. Obviously, I need to find other other pieces in your story that kind of align with this theme that I think this story needs to be about.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:59]:
Okay. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:06:00]:
So that's that's that's how I approach that. And I do think in terms of themes, we're not just telling people stories to tell them We're looking for some sort of general theme or lesson, that people can identify because when you're telling your story or any story, people aren't just interested in the story for sake of the story, they want to see their own story in that story.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:19]:
Yeah. And and when it comes to blogging, that's kind of we've touched on this in other sessions where you know, anyone can write a post on 17 ways to, you know, make money on the site or whatever. But the way that it stands out is is the stories you you kind of include and and see, oh, I can fit it into my time because they did it this way. And, yeah, so I think that's a great point, and it ties well into blogging, right, because everyone's you know, you've got your own little slice of webs of the web with an angle.

Jeff Goins [00:06:49]:
Yeah. And and sorry to interrupt, but, There's a difference between traffic and trust.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:55]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:06:55]:
Everybody wants traffic. 13 ways to do it ever. We'll generate some traffic, and that's great. But traffic is easy to measure. Trust is hard to measure, except when it matters. When it matters, when it comes time to sell the thing or get everybody to buy your book or or you just need your little corner of the internet to be in your corner to support you that's where trust pays off and traffic may not. Right? So just because you get a bunch of eyeballs doesn't mean you necessarily have trust, and I would argue telling stories, being empathetic, being vulnerable over the long haul gets people to trust you much more than, you know, going viral does.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:36]:
Absolutely. No. I think that's a that's a great thing to point out because a lot of people do just focus on, traffic and qualifying for an ad network and, you know, but really building a community that trusts you is it's harder, but it pays off better, and it's and you're gonna like it a lot better, I think. Yeah. You feel better about what you're doing. yeah, because So I know you have this. I just wanna bring it up because a lot of people struggle with being consistent in terms of blogging.

Jeff Goins [00:08:05]:
I

Liz Stapleton [00:08:05]:
know you've got a 31 day riding challenge. but how kind of how do you develop a strong writing habit? Like, what would you suggest things to do? Cause there is so much that goes into blogging side's just the writing, not to mention life itself.

Jeff Goins [00:08:19]:
I was I was talking to a friend recently about anger. And, she has done a lot of therapy. I've done a lot of therapy. and I said, you know, I always understood anger. My therapist always called anger boundary setting emotion. And and she said, yeah, that's true. She said, but I heard A therapist say once that it's also, an action emotion. When you get angry, you take action. and anger, is what leads to action. You know, so people sometimes we stigmatize anger. I shouldn't be angry about this or whatever. and her therapist was saying, no. No. No. Like, you know, why is this not changing, this behavior, right, and she said, I don't know. I just can't beat it. Whatever. because you need to get some anger behind this in order to change this behavior. And so anger is the action that changes things. And so often when we're feeling unmotivated, there's a reason for it. And I I'm not into, you know, naval gaze for the sake of just going, why, why, why, why, why? Cause that doesn't necessarily lead to action. Insights don't always lead to action, unfortunately. which is why you can go to therapy for many years and still deal with the same things. And why you could say, I'm gonna write a book or sort of blog for many years and really, really want to do it and not be able to do it. So I often get this question. I don't know how to answer it completely because it's up to you. Yeah. And the reason that it's up to you is that you have to eventually get so angry at yourself not not beat up on yourself, not shame yourself, but get angry that you're not doing the thing that you say you wanna do so that it leads to action so that you get motivated to do it. I don't believe that you can force yourself to do something you don't really want to do. Mhmm. It won't work. But lack of motivation, usually is about some pain that we're trying to avoid, some fear or shame or discomfort that we're trying to avoid. So one, you've gotta get a little bit angry. Right? And then 2, you've gotta do it, even when you don't feel like it, which I know sounds like well, duh, but I think the way that that happens is we all get caught up in certain negative thought patterns. And and that's where where procrastination comes from. It's, we're seeking pleasure in temporary ways and we're avoiding pain that there's the pain and discomfort of doing this thing that we're not good at. We don't like right now because we're not good at it. and we associate it with pain. And so what you have to essentially do is you have to retrain your brain to associate this activity the pleasure, not pain. And people do this with working out all the time. They do with all kinds of things. Right? you've got to you've gotta change your thought pattern about this. And the best way to do that is with action. Right? And so Victor Frankl says between the stimulus in the the response, there's a space. And in that space, there's a choice. Right? So when I'm not feeling like doing something, I can become aware that I I'll go, oh, I I don't feel like doing this. Well, do I really wanna do this? This is as important to me, yadayadayada?

Liz Stapleton [00:11:30]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:11:30]:
Okay. What one small thing that I can do to just make it half in. Right? So in the case of writing, just write something. This is how I started writing every day was I just wrote something. And eventually, it was, like, you know, 500 words or whatever, but, like, early on was a sentence or 2 or a paragraph. And I do this to this day. I'm avoiding writing a book right now, and and today, I just locked off some time. And and I've got 4 hours blocked off. Right? And I will find every reason to not do that. And the way that I'll get into the groove is I'll just have to write something there's 2 things that I do.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:03]:
1,

Jeff Goins [00:12:04]:
I just write something, especially if I'm dealing with a habit that I, can't, you know, really stay on top of. and then I'll immediately reward myself. Right? and this it sounds it can sound silly, but this I mean, Neil Fiori, one of the leading psychologists in the world procrastination. So it's basically when you're procrastinating, which is you can call it whatever you want when you're not doing the thing that you say you wanna do. You're procrastinating. there is a childlike version of yourself inside of you that says, I don't wanna do this, and you can't make me. My my my three year old recently, I was trying to put her to bed.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:40]:
Uh-huh.

Jeff Goins [00:12:40]:
And she was not having it. You know? And she said, I don't agree with your rules. What am I supposed to do? Go to bed, please. You know, you're pranking me child. you know, I don't agree with your rule. So there's a three year old inside. He goes, I don't like this. I don't agree with your rules. and so what you have to do with the child is you have to, train them. This is a good thing. So, you know, please write this thing, and I'll give you a cookie.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:08]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:13:08]:
And and I will literally write, you know, if I'm if I'm really struggling with with self discipline, Yeah. I will write something, do something, and then I'll go have a smoothie or a latte or a cookie. Mhmm. And and and you will, I mean, it it it affects your brain. And so, that's my approach to it is is you've gotta get to the root of why you're doing this. And if you really don't wanna do it, just be honest, I don't wanna do it and do something else.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:36]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:13:36]:
but if it's just a question of, I really need to do this. You might need to get a little bit of anger around, Right? Why haven't you done this? Yeah. You know, what is that about? Let's do you really want this? Then get serious about it. Do something very, very small. tiny habits, you know, 10 minutes. Yep. And then reward yourself and do this over and over and over again, in and until you start to forward to the activity. and it doesn't mean that it's not hard and there's plenty of plateaus. That's a part of any process but writing these days is something I look forward to.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:11]:
Yeah. No. I I I totally agree. I I do wanna add on the flip side. my six year old, Nesia, they told me I couldn't do something. And I was like, actually, I can. You know, because when you're adult, you get to make those choices. So don't just do that. I don't wanna recognize you have a choice, and and there's some some privilege in that a little bit. and I totally relate to what you're saying. creating the summit, actually, because I was originally gonna have it last year. And so it got kind of pushed back, but I'm really, you know, and it was hard, but I'm really glad I did it. That's right. And I'm really excited for it now. You know? Good. so we've touched on this a little bit about trust versus traffic and sort of defining success and what you want your business and success to look like.

Jeff Goins [00:14:59]:
k.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:00]:
So, you know, how would you recommend sort of defining success with the blog trust, of course, is one way, but it's hard to kind of measure that, like you said. Any thoughts on sort of --

Jeff Goins [00:15:12]:
Yeah. I mean, success is always just you getting what you want. Right? So I can't tell you what success is like for you, and you can't tell me what success is like for me. It really is subjective. you know, he's successful. She's successful. success, really, I mean, you know, you can just look up the definition. It it is getting what you want, achieving the thing that you set out to do. So step number 1 that most people don't really think about when it comes to success is know what you want.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:37]:
Mhmm. Right?

Jeff Goins [00:15:38]:
So many years, I didn't know what I wanted. I was pursuing other people's definitions of success. and

Liz Stapleton [00:15:42]:
-- -- get those income reports from other bloggers or something. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:15:45]:
And and it would make me jealous and angry and sad and depressed and all kinds of things. And I was I was making a $1,000,000 a year feeling like a failure, because I was always looking at somebody else's definition. And I had to start to zoom out and go, do I even have the thing that I want, or is even this version of success somebody like, did I get it from somebody else?

Liz Stapleton [00:16:08]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:16:09]:
so step number and and I was, you know, I was pursuing other people's definition of success. Step number 1, know what you want. step number 2, put on blinders and achieve it and see if that's actually what you want because you may get it. this is the one I want. I wanted something else. So I think success at, like, a high macro level is, getting what you want and actually getting clear on that and doing it and not worrying about what everybody else is doing. which is hard, but, you know, if you do enough things that other people say that you should do and it doesn't make you happy, at some point, you've gotta decide for yourself What is it I actually want and how do I get it? For me, you know, if I were to to define this and I and I think this applies to a lot of other people, what does success look like? for a lot of bloggers, it doesn't mean traffic or trust necessarily. It's about a tribe. I mean, the way that you would quantify trust would be through a tribe, a small, but dedicated group of people who are all in Right? Kevin Kelly talks about your 1000 true fans. Seth Gordon describes a tribe as a small group of people, which I think is interesting. When we talk about tribes, we're like, I've got a tribe of a 100,000 or a1000000, you know, people. But, I mean, if you think about that term, historically speaking, you know, tribe was a tribe was always a small group of people, about a 150 people. Right? And and that's that whole idea that we can only Was that Dunbar's number? I think you can only have relationship with about a 150 people at a time. So most times were about a 100 to a 150 people. They got too big. They would break off and make their own tribe because you just couldn't lead that many people that way. this year, I'm experimenting with working with only a hundred people, because I, in previous years, had

Liz Stapleton [00:18:02]:
10, 15, 20000

Jeff Goins [00:18:04]:
clients in a year. And I I didn't I would go to an event and somebody say, I'm in your course and I'd go, you are, you know, I've never seen it before in my life. Right? Yeah. And so I didn't like the fact that I didn't know the people that I was supposedly helping. And and now I'm experimenting with going much, much smaller, and it's a lot more fun. I'm actually making more money. And it's just a different way of doing things. So I think success is having enough people pay attention to you. so that you can make the money that you wanna make and do the kind of work that you wanna do the way that you wanna do it.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:41]:
Yeah. And those less than, I mean, a good traffic number. And I like that your your idea of success may change. It may, you know, it's it's kinda fluid in a way as you figure things out and achieve different things.

Jeff Goins [00:18:52]:
Yeah. I mean, you get clearer as you walk down the road, clarity comes with action.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:57]:
Yeah. No. Absolutely. I mean, I've been blogging for 6 years, and I'm still, like, Oh, actually. You know? Yeah. Exactly. So it never stops. But, so how do you because, you are such a great storyteller? and blogger and just everything, and podcast. And how do you balance sort of the re you know, the reading, the research, and the writing, to create sort of the the content you want?

Jeff Goins [00:19:24]:
I always start with what I wanna say. If you don't start with that, I mean, you know, this is the scientific method, right, start with a hypothesis and then go test it. So I start with what I want to say, and I believe that it's better to be interesting than it is to be good. now I'm not giving people, licensed to be bad, but there are plenty of good writers who are not saying interesting things and we're not paying attention to them. And to be honest, there are plenty of bad writers who are saying interesting things and lots of people are paying attention to them. So what I want for you, dear, writer, is to be both, right, to care about the craft, to write well, and be interesting. Now interesting means that you attack whatever your audience takes for granted that there's always something surprising about what you have to say. And it doesn't mean you have to be controversial for the sake of being controversial. but you've you've gotta say something unique. Right? So when I wrote the art of work, what I realized I wanted to say what I thought I wanna say was everybody's got a calling, and it looks like this. And that's kind of boring. And as I began to do the research and talk to people, I realized that everybody has a life's work in them that they want to pursue and share with the world, but it the process will surprise you about how you get there.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:43]:
Mhmm.

Jeff Goins [00:20:44]:
And, and so when I am writing, researching, editing, all of that, I start with the idea. I go, is this something that excites me? And then I start researching to see if it's true. Right? And then through that research, I tend to find some thread or something that that kind of pops out to me. Oh, look at this. So when I was writing, my latest book, Real Art of Stone, starve. I, started with the idea that there were basically these 2 groups of people creatives who were thriving and those who were not, I thought, what's what what's going on with these people? Right? Is is is one just, you know, one group lucky.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:20]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:21:21]:
And and as I started research, You know, I thought, I think this might be a choice, you know, being a starving artist. And, and while I was doing the research, I stumbled across the story of Colangelo who had $50,000,000 when he died, and it turns out he was the richest artist of the Renaissance. And I thought, Well, that's interesting. We've got this guy who's one of the greatest artists of all time, and he was wealthy. And he wasn't a sellout. and he wasn't starving. So what could that tell us as a theme as a thread about creative work So, you know, at that point, I start diving into the research, get as much as I can get, and then I go write the book. But I always, as I start working on the book, the blog post, whatever, as I start working on something, I'll run into walls. And I go, I don't know what to do here. I'm out of argument, you know, and I'll have to go do some research to kind of fill in the pieces. But as much as possible, I try to Get the idea, do as much research, 80% of the research, then start the writing, and then go back and kind of fill in the that I'm missing, because you'll you'll get to a point where you go, I I'm making stuff up now. Right? Like, I'm I'm faking my way through an argument. I need another story. Like, I've run out of juice, and I've gotta go back to the, you know, the well and get some more water so to speak.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:37]:
Yeah. No. And I like that you say, you know, when you pump the ideas, does it excite you? Because, you know, in a recession, we talk about, you know, using analytics and keyword research and, you know, yes, those things are important, but you need to find the angle that excites you to make it something that you can really, help I guess. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:22:57]:
You know, an SEO and keyword research is great, but understand that all that is is robots trying to understand how people work.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:05]:
Mhmm.

Jeff Goins [00:23:05]:
So you're a person. And if you can figure out how people work, you can work with the robots to, you know, reach the people but if you write for human beings, because, you know, Google's always changing their algorithm and people who are hardcore in SEO, and I, I really was for a long time, you know, googling and and searching and testing, you know, this tag, this title over that one, this headline over that. There's a lot of merit to that. but, you know, one little tweak and, you know, all of a sudden, your dev your business model is devastated because you've you've gone too far in the direction of the robots. And so, you know, I think it's a bit simplistic, but if you always write for humans and the job of the robots is to reach those humans, You're gonna be okay. So remember that you aren't writing for robots or running for humans?

Liz Stapleton [00:23:53]:
Yes. Exactly. And it and it makes it more fun too for for humans.

Jeff Goins [00:23:57]:
Yeah. Again, you're if it's not just about traffic, it's about trust and eventually, you know, having that tribe of email subscribers, followers, people, who are really hardcore into whatever you have to say, you're gonna be able to make a lot of money for a long time with that group of people.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:15]:
Okay. and I think you've touched on it a little bit, but I think especially for newer bloggers that are struggling how do you sort of decide on your angle? Or, I mean, the story that you find helps with that, but your idea, where do you get ideas from early December.

Jeff Goins [00:24:30]:
For, like, a blog for, like, a blog post? Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:33]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:24:35]:
I I agree with Elizabeth Gilbert that ideas just come to people. you know, in her book, big magic, she describes this, you know, and tell stories of poets and musicians about literally like this idea just coming to you. you know, I'll if if you're not It'll

Liz Stapleton [00:24:49]:
leave you if you don't pay attention to it.

Jeff Goins [00:24:50]:
Yeah. Right. Right. So, you know, I try to take a shower once in a while. I go for a walk once in a while. I drive somewhere once in a while. And ideas hit me. Right? You and I were talking, and I said the thing about traffic and trust. And I thought, you know, I've never said that before. Trust versus traffic. It just popped into my head. And so I wrote it down. So I don't think it's about getting ideas. I think it's about capturing ideas. Right? We are always getting ideas. Ideas are always coming to us. Ideas want to be birthed through us. They want to be made manifest in the world. and so, if you're not getting ideas, you need to slow down. You need to go for a walk. You need to work out. take a shower, step away from the technology, leave your phone for a minute, and just move because ideas will come. So it's about capturing ideas. And for that, I use what I call the 3 bucket system. 3 bucket system. You can Google it. I did a thing with Evernote on it a while back. very simple productivity system for writing. I'm not real into systems and formulas, but this is a thing that I found I was just sort of doing. So I kind of codified it, called it in the 3 bucket system. So basically content creation, writing is 3 things, not one thing. And when you're struggling with writer's block, it because you're trying to do all three things at once. So it's coming up with ideas. It's drafting those ideas into something readable and then it's editing it into something publishable. Right? So it's, I ideation coming up with an idea, writing, and then editing. So it's, you know, good. Right? Yeah. So most people go. They sit down. They go, alright. I I saw this thing on a blogger breakthrough summit. I'm gonna do this thing now. And, they sit down at 6 AM and they go, idea, idea, idea. I don't know. And, this idea, and then they start, you know, they spend 20 minutes doing that. And then they ride, and they feel bad about us. Not very good. You know, type, type, type, delete, type, type, type, delete. It's a lot of pressure, right, for, it's like, here's a canvas. fill his canvas with something beautiful and sell it by noon. Right? and so I use what I call the 3 bucket system, which means I'm always capturing ideas I just wrote an idea down. So that's my rule. My first rule is you get an idea. You write it down. It doesn't matter where you are. Right? you're at your kids recital. You're at church. synagogue, you know, whatever, you, you, you write it down. And then you go back to being present, right, from that family dinner or something and get an idea. I go, hang on one second. Type, type, type, type, just a word or a sentence, not 500 words.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:22]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:27:23]:
I capture the idea, then I have a meeting with myself every morning to write for about an hour or

Jeff Goins [00:27:30]:
And then I take one of those ideas out of my idea bucket and I put it into my drafts bucket and I 500 words on it. And I stop at about 500 words. I save it, and I and I put it into another bucket. Right? And I use just a tagging system on bear that allows you to very easily go, okay, this is in drafts. Now it's, you know, this is idea bucket. Now it's in drafts, etcetera. And then I will take something out of my drafts bucket that I wrote a previous day could be yesterday or 2 weeks ago or 2 months ago, and I edit that and get that ready to publish. And sometimes I'll do this, you know, I'll I'll come up with an ID on Monday, right, and then Tuesday, I'll draft it. And, you know, on Wednesday, I'll edit it. But meanwhile, I'm doing I'm doing other things. And so the system is not about writing something, editing it, and getting it ready to publish. It's about always having ideas and capturing those ideas. So I've got a bucket full of ideas. Mhmm. It's about taking those ideas one one at a time and drafting them into something So I've got a bucket of drafts, and then it's editing those and getting them ready to publish. So I have a bucket of edits. And so at any time, I sit down, I've got something to work on. And my job, writing every day, is not about coming up with some staggering work of genius, It's just about moving something from one bucket to the next. So as long as I'm capturing ideas and I've got ideas in my idea bucket, as long as I'm moving one idea to the draft bucket, one draft to the edits bucket, I'm doing my job.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:55]:
Yep. And and I like the idea of the buckets because, you know, if you've got multiple things in each bucket, then you don't have to worry about, you know, being consistent. You're gonna manage it.

Jeff Goins [00:29:04]:
You never have to worry. You if you do this, it'll take 3 days. You'll never have to worry about what to write again. Day 1, get a bunch of ideas. Stop. Mhmm. Day 2, you've got ideas. So now you you you draft some things. And now you've got 2 buckets. Right? You've got a couple of ideas, your idea bucket, and now you've got something in your draft bucket. You stop, and that's day 2. Day 3, You're still getting ideas, you know, and then at least you gotta get more ideas in your idea bucket. You take your draft, and you edit it then you go back and you take one of your ideas and you draft it again. Now you got something in all three buckets, and now the game is just to keep the buckets full.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:40]:
Yeah. No. I do wanna ask you. I'm just curious because a lot of times my writing is actually dictating.

Jeff Goins [00:29:47]:
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:48]:
Do you so, you know, do you think does that matter?

Jeff Goins [00:29:51]:
Does -- Does that count?

Liz Stapleton [00:29:52]:
-- your thoughts on that? Well, I think it counts, obviously. I've put out a ton of content that way, but you know, I'm a more of a talker than a right. I was a math major. The fact that I'm a blogger's. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:30:01]:
That's great.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:02]:
you know, but sort of in terms of utilizing that time because if I'm walking and talking, I just get things flowing better.

Jeff Goins [00:30:10]:
Yes. Yeah. I I I do the same. speaking and writing are different crafts for me. And so if you do that, I still think, you know, you sit down and you edit it and you kinda wrap some around it and all of that. but I find it, you know, I agree it's a great way to get ideas down for sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:27]:
Yeah. Yeah. I know. I -- And

Jeff Goins [00:30:28]:
you get a lot

Liz Stapleton [00:30:28]:
of content. Yeah. Yeah. no, I was just curious because the way you're describing it. I was like, that's actually I was like, I come up with an idea and outline, and then I go dictate. And then I -- Oh,

Jeff Goins [00:30:38]:
that's great. Yeah. A lot of people just ramble and I find I've done that before and I find that's not as useful. Yeah. I do a lot of speaking. And so what I'll often do is I'll, kind of like write, like, a talk, you know, and I'll and I'll just kind of rant on it. I'll ramble a little bit on my podcast.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:56]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:30:57]:
my podcast is audio essays, basically. And then when I'm done with that, I'll sit down and I'll write it because now I've gotten all the ideas out. And and as you're talking, you'll go, wait, this is is this a work like this? Hang on. I gotta pause it and go back here. So by the by the end of talking through it, you're very clear on the idea. And then you can sit down and really turn it into a good piece of writing instead of trying to write your way through it.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:19]:
Yeah. No. I I and I think I think I find, you know, because you're going to get to the editing point. Right? So much easier when there's stuff on there. Even with the bad stuff.

Jeff Goins [00:31:27]:
Oh, I agree.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:27]:
Yeah. Like, just have something on the page. Mhmm. But, yeah, so don't don't stress yourself about the good writing during the writing portion of the or the drafting portion bucket.

Jeff Goins [00:31:37]:
Yeah. You're just getting ideas down. You're just getting words down.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:39]:
Mhmm. Yeah. okay. And I did wanna ask you about kind of tools. You said something about Bear. What

Jeff Goins [00:31:46]:
There, b e a r. I think it's only for Mac and iOS at this point. it's like a beautiful note taking app. It's just real simple. it's what I use. You could use Evernote. It's it's like a simpler version of Evernote where you use lots of tagging and stuff. So, I I use it to blog. I use it to take notes. it's my note taking out.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:05]:
Okay. I was just yeah. are there any other sort of tools or things you'd recommend to help people set up and fill those those buckets?

Jeff Goins [00:32:13]:
If you're working on a book, I use scrivener for that, but just blogging bear, b e a r is my tool. anything that just gets you writing doesn't have to be fancy. People get really obsessed about the tools. And should I use this writing app or is that writing app? I just I just switched from, you know, this to Ulysses or whatever. I, a writer. What else? Okay. I've tried all those things and they're all basically the same. You know? I I

Liz Stapleton [00:32:39]:
-- -- different procrastination method.

Jeff Goins [00:32:41]:
Yeah. It doesn't matter. You know? Seth Gordon said once that's, you know, we think that if we knew, what kind of cereal Stephen King ate in the morning, if we ate that cereal, we'd be we'd be like him. You know? And it was when somebody was asking, Seth, how he writes, and he refused to answer the question.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:02]:
Okay.

Jeff Goins [00:33:02]:
He says, because if I tell you that, then you're gonna think that's that's how you should do it. The truth is how I write is just a collection of weird quirky habits that works for me. And so the takeaway is find what works for you, find the tool that works for you. I found that, you know, any tool that's too complicated, I I found that Evernote does too much It's too complicated for me. It's clunky. I'll spend all of my time trying to organize it instead of just dumping words onto a page.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:31]:
Yeah. But I

Jeff Goins [00:33:32]:
needed a tool that helps me do what I do, which is kind of phonetically and frantically just write stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:38]:
Yeah. No. That's why I like asking about tools because it's I could be using something that I'm like, to pay, but, you know, and then I learn. I'm like, oh, this works for my the way my brain works a lot better. not necessarily, you know, because I think the more there's so many out there, and there's no way -- -- overwhelming. Yeah. Yeah. And so hearing kind of what other people use, you can check me like, oh, not for me. Yes. That's awesome. Whatever.

Jeff Goins [00:33:59]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:59]:
but, yeah, no, I think this is fantastic. Are there any final words you wanna kind of kind of add to?

Jeff Goins [00:34:05]:
Oh, no. I mean, you know, my my sort of stock advice for writers, bloggers, is, keep going. Right? People

Liz Stapleton [00:34:14]:
You're gonna be embarrassed by what you put out at the beginning.

Jeff Goins [00:34:17]:
Yeah. Oh, sure. And and and always, you know, there's always room to grow. And I found out, you know, through a lot of trial and error and just figuring out what, you know, what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. most of that stuff, takes care of itself with time. And when I started blogging in 2006,

Jeff Goins [00:34:39]:
You know, lots of people came on the scene after, you know, several years, and we all have the same goals, the same aspirations. And a lot of those people got discouraged and quit and moved on. And I totally get it. It's a very discouraging process. but the people who succeeded were the people who kept going. And so I have to remember that myself, even when I'm facing, you know, whatever, challenge I'm dealing with today, which is plenty. is, really, the difference between a professional and amateur is the professional keeps going in the amateur quits.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:11]:
Yeah, I like that. Again thank you for taking the time, everyone should go check out your site, goinswriter.com, correct? Definitely go pick up one of his books if not all of them, because the are fantastic.

Jeff Goins [00:35:22]:
Oh, thanks.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:24]:
you know, I I really I do reference it. It's one of my favorite favorite books that I kind of if I need a little note of inspiration, I'd go to one of the dog ear pages. so so thank you again. I really appreciate it.

Jeff Goins [00:35:22]:
My pleasure. Thanks, Elizabeth.
