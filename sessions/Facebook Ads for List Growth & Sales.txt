Hello, hello, incredible bloggers. Welcome to this presentation on how to run Facebook Ads for list growth without having to worry about all those pesky changes with iOS 14, 15, and even the Facebook Ads Pixel. I am super excited for this presentation because if you're watching it, there's a good chance you're trying to get more people on your email list. You're trying to get people to give you their name and email so that you can market your products and services. And this is something that I've been doing with Facebook Ads for years. I love it. I think it's one of the most effective ways to grow your list. And real quick, if you're wondering who the heck is this guy, hello, my name is Zach Spuckler. You can find me on Instagram over @zackspuckler. I'm an agency owner. We do Facebook and Instagram Ads for online creators. I've managed over three and a half million dollars in ad spend. I've created multiple digital courses that we've taken to the six-figure mark. And on a less serious note, I have a dog, Charles Barkley, two cats, Shasda and Luki. We're welcoming a third kitchen into our little clan very soon here.

[00:01:14.450] - Zach
I'm Disney and RuPaul-obsessed like Disney tattoos -- RuPaul all up in my office. Like can't get enough of them, especially Trixie Mattel. If you are a RuPaul person, you know, you know. I have over a dozen tattoos. And I love digital marketing; and I love to put that one in there because I think sometimes in the online marketing space, we think like, oh, people teach this stuff because it's easy. I teach this stuff because it's fun. Like I, I can talk about Facebook Ads all day, right. I love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. And so I'm really excited to hopefully bring some of that passion and excitement that I have for advertising to you. So real quick, let's talk about the flow, right. And when I say the flow, what I'm talking about is like, how does this actually work? How do we actually leverage Facebook Ads to grow our business, right? Because we're going to talk about growing your email list, but the big conversation is that when somebody clicks on your Facebook Ad, you want them to also go into an email sequence, right? And I'm going to talk to you about how to write a compelling ad and where to get those ads started.

[00:02:15.130] - Zach
But I want -- I want to just make sure we mention that, you know, when somebody joins your list, you want to put them through an email sequence. And that sequence should tell them who you are, what you have for sale, how they can work with you, and important information that they need to make a buying decision with you from your blog business, right. So, what we do is we always start with a freebie. Okay. So you probably may potentially maybe not, that's okay, have this on your website already where people can give you their name and email for a freebie. Right? And we like to start with a freebie. This is the one that we're currently running in our business. It's a 2024 planner, and it's basically how to plan your course or blogging business for the next year, right, very timely, very relevant. Well, here's the thing. This freebie works wonders. We get people joining our list every single day from it, and it's because it's simple. We're giving our audience what they want, right. Especially in November, December, people are thinking about planning. They're thinking about what's next. They're thinking about their next steps, right. So it's simple. If you're like, what should I give my audience in exchange for a name and email

[00:03:16.650] - Zach
it's simple. Ask them what they want and make sure it meets this criteria. Number one, is it relevant? Okay. The biggest mistake I see people make with freebies is they create a freebie that's not relevant to their business but specifically to their products, right. So this is like a real big over exaggeration, but I'm talking about growing your business, right? So if my freebie was, let's say, grow your business using Instagram or create a really viral Instagram Reel, well, that's great. It speaks to my audience. But my offers are all around Facebook Ads so it's not relevant, right? The second thing is you want it to be digestible. It doesn't need to be massive. It doesn't need to be huge. You don't need to have a million things go into your freebie. People need to be able to get through it. Because in order for people to use your freebie, they have to be able to, you know, get through your freebie. So, you also want it to be desirable, and that's kind of what we talked about. It's like, is it something people actually want? I see a lot of people do freebies that are like, my top three tips, or my seven steps for that, and it's like 

[00:04:13.390] - Zach
that feels very Googleable. That feels very bloggable. But it doesn't seem like something I want to give my name and email for. So, make sure it's something people want. And finally, this is a huge one for me, make sure it's valuable. Okay. Make sure that what you're giving people is actually valuable. Okay. My planner, it's 15 pages long, but you could actually plan your quarters and years out with it. Like we've actually created something of value. So don't just throw something together because, remember, this is people's first impression of you. You want them to get a good impression, right? So make sure it's valuable. Now, if you're listening to this and you're already going, oh, my gosh, Zach. I feel really overwhelmed. You've, you've said so many things already. It's only been five minutes. And I don't know what to give away for free to start growing my list. Well, let me give you my favorite hack. I go to Creative Market and I just type in freebie template Canva, and it will kick out all of these workbooks, e-books, checklists, PDFs that you can use for your business in Canva and give away for free, right. Now you have to edit them, tweak them, put your content in there, but it's really easy to just get started, right.

[00:05:23.870] - Zach
So, if you're like I've done freebies, or maybe you fallen prey to like that three tips or five steps and you're like I need something more robust, this is a great way to get it. Okay. So we have to have that conversation so that we have this conversation, and this conversation is lead generation ads to grow your email list. So we are running ads to grow our email list 24/7. Okay. There's pretty much not a day that goes by in our business, and there's always exceptions, but I would say 95 % of the time we're running an ad that directly grows our email list. Okay. What we run is what's called a lead ad. Okay. And a lot of people are like, oh, I want to send people to my website, my Mailchimp, my ConvertKit, my ActiveCampaign, my, you know, Squarespace, my WordPress, where people go to my website fill out their name and email and then they get my freebie, right. What we recommend in our business and for our clients is what's called a lead ad or an on-Facebook experience. Okay. So you've traditionally seen the ads where you click on it and it takes you over to a website. A lead ad or a lead form ad, as they're sometimes called, is where people click on your ad,

[00:06:34.870] - Zach
we all know what the ads look like we spend a lot of time on Facebook and Instagram so we know what the ads look like, but then we send them over to a form that exists on Facebook. Okay. This is our secret weapon, and we love it for a variety of reasons. Three big ones, though, number one, it does not require the Facebook Pixel. So people always ask us, how do I use the pixel? What do I do with the Pixel? How do I install the Pixel? And we say, If you're just at the point where you're trying to grow your list, don't worry about the pixel yet, right. If you know how it works, great. This is just going to enhance that. Second thing is it tracks with near 100 % accuracy because everything is happening on Facebook. So when someone goes to your website, if they have iOS 14 or they have tracking disabled, it may not report even if they had clicked on a Facebook Ad back to you that they signed up for your email list, and that makes tracking the data very hard. Okay. The third reason I love them is they're very easy to set up, and they're cheaper, right.

[00:07:35.370] - Zach
We typically find that lead ads are 20 to 40 percent cheaper than standard ads where you send people over to your website to give you their name and email, right. These tend to work a little bit better. Okay. Now, one thing worth noting is that because everything happens on Facebook, you need a piece of software to move it over to your email service provider, your ESP, right, so that could be Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Flodesk, right. The place that you go to send emails to your full list, you need what we call a bridge software that moves the leads from Facebook over to there. Okay. If you don't, Facebook will simply keep the information on Facebook, and that doesn't give you the ability to email them. So, in terms of what you actually need like from a brass tax perspective to run these ads, you'll need an email service provider. I recommend ConvertKit. I think it's really great, very much catered towards creators. And a software I recommend called Save My Leads will take the leads from Facebook and put them into ConvertKit. Okay. Now, one thing I want to say is there's unlimited alternatives to both, really, right. So you don't have to use ConvertKit.

[00:08:48.240] - Zach
You can use Flodesk, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Keap, you know, it doesn't matter. A couple of other ones, if you're like Save My Leads is my favorite because it's the easiest to set up as a bridge software. But if you don't have Save My Leads, you can also use Zapier. And Zapier pretty much integrates with pretty much everything I've seen so far. But if you still are having issues, you can also check out integrately.io as another alternative. Okay. So again, if you're kind of like hitting that point which a lot of my newer clients hit where they say, this is great but I'll just send them to my website because I don't want to hassle with that. Well, here's the thing. With lead ads, you get a lower CPM, right, and CPM stands for cost per thousand impressions. And basically it's cheaper. It costs less money to run an ad where they stay on Facebook because Facebook likes when you keep people on Facebook. So they charge you less to run these ads. We also typically see a higher conversion rate, right. So typically, more people who see these ads and click on them sign up. We get as high as 70, 80 percent conversion.

[00:09:55.190] - Zach
So typically, when you send someone to your website, 30 to 40 percent of them will convert to your freebie best-case scenario. Best-case scenario with lead ads, we see like 70 percent to 80 percent, right. So almost twice as many people actually click and fill out the form. If it costs less to run them and more people who click sign up, you end up with a lower cost per lead, right. So, you ultimately end up paying less money for this lead that's going to still potentially convert to a sale. So I just want to show you lead ads in the Ads Manager. When you go to set up your ads, you're going to see you go into the Ads Manager and you click to create a new campaign. You're going to see that one of your options is leads, right, and that's what we're looking to do. We're looking for leads. Names and emails are leads, right. And in your next step, you're going to see that you can choose website or instant forms along with a number of other options. But website is where you're driving people to your own page, right. Instant form is what we're talking about today, right.

[00:10:59.730] - Zach
So, I want to talk, you know, these are the ads that I want you to run, right. Run ads for lead forms. People fill out their name and email on Facebook. It sends it to your CRM, where they then get that email sequence that we talked about, right. So now we need to talk about the images and the copy, right. How do you actually make an ad that you can put in the Ads Manager that works well? Well, first, there are four primary image types that we work with, with our clients and our members and our membership. And these are mockup, stock photos, lifestyle photos, and text photos. Okay. So a mockup, at least for us, has always done the best, right. If you have something that you can represent visually, especially on Facebook and Instagram, people are very visual, right. They're on a platform where they're looking at content. So, if you can visually represent in a mockup format what you're promoting, these typically do very, very well for us. Okay. For us, we get one to two-dollar leads of the planner. This is one that we did in 2022. We do our planner every single year because it always works great.

[00:12:07.110] - Zach
But you can see it's super simple. It's just a mockup of the freebie. Okay. The second type that we run is a text ad, and that's where we're focusing on text. Now, if you've run Facebook ads in the past, maybe like three or four years ago, there used to be this rule with Facebook that you can't have more than 20 percent of your image be taken up by text, but that's gone. That doesn't exist anymore. So, you can take up a ton of space on your image, asking a question that grabs their attention -- asking a question that gets them to pay attention. Right, so we have a text ad. The next ad that we have is a lifestyle ad. Okay. A lifestyle ad is where we get someone's attention by showing them our lifestyle, right. So if you're a lifestyle blogger, a fashion blogger, maybe even a food blogger like a picture of you in your kitchen would be great, right. So this is something that showcases like our lifestyle. And to be clear, these don't have to be -- these don't have to be like high-quality branded photos. They don't need to be done by a professional photographer. Some of my best lifestyle photos from ads, I've just taken a selfie at my desk.

[00:13:10.780] - Zach
I've had my partner, my friends, family members take a picture of me out in the wild -- out in the wild, you know, just interacting with my, my environment, right, and those can work really great. And finally is stock photos. We have a couple clients where stock photos do really stinking well. Okay. So don't be fooled by the simplicity of an image. It just has to help your client kind of see who they are reflected back at them, right. So don't stress about like, oh, I don't know if I should do a lifestyle or a mockup or a text or a stock. Pick two or three mock them up like create them in Canva and see how they work. Okay. So images, I think, are shockingly or deceptively simple, I should say, because you don't need to do anything crazy fancy. You don't need special design software. You can do it in Canva. You don't need a $1,000 camera. It's just create an image that makes your audience stop and go, oh, what is that? Right. So, the mockup makes them go, what is that? The lifestyle makes them say, that's someone in the kitchen. I want to cook, right. It's something that helps them kind of like see the potential or, or of who they want to be or who you are or invokes curiosity, right.

[00:14:25.180] - Zach
And with that, you need to couple it with copy. So copy is just literally the text that goes with your image. And this is my simple tutorial. This is the framework that I teach to everyone who goes through my ads boot camp hook, question, authority, content, call to action, close. Okay. So real quick, what we do is we start with a hook. Okay. And a hook is something that grabs people's attention and helps them kind of say like, oh, what is that? Right. So if I was a food blogger that's teaching people how to meal prep a week's worth of meals in under three hours, I might say, does meal prepping take you eight hours on the weekends and cost you your time, sanity, and that quality time with your kids? Right, it grabs their attention. It may also interweave or be a question, but the second step is always a question that helps them self-identify. So, for example, if you are teaching people how to manage their budget, your question might be like, does your budget feel out of control? Right, because that helps them go, yes, that's me. I feel that way. I connect with that statement -- me, me, me,

[00:15:33.950] - Zach
I, I, I, right. You want your audience to be able to read your copy and kind of be nodding their head along up and down like, yes, that's me, right. So a hook grabs their attention. A question helps them say, yes, that's me. And then authority is, why should I trust you? Hey, I'm Carmen, and I paid off $100,000 of credit card debt in three years, and I want to show you my step-by-step process to pay off debt, right. It grabs their attention, tells them that they're in the right place, and then says here's why you should trust me. The content is quite simply, what is the freebie,right, a workbook, a planner, a cheat sheet, a downloadable, a template, you know. What are they actually getting? And then the call to action is click to download the workbook, right. Sounds silly. Don't forget the call to action. We've tested this, and there's been a lot of tests done that say when you tell people click the link, they will click the link at a higher rate than if you just don't, right. So guide people on what you want them to do. And then finally, your close is just your sign-off, right. So close by saying, you know, hope to see you crushing your debt, you know, Carvin, right.

[00:16:42.530] - Zach
You don't have to do that. The close is optional. But my brand is very personal, very interconnected. A lot of blogger brands are very personal. So typically we add a close to our ads that make it feel like a personal sign-off, right. So once you've -- like let's just take a step back, we're going to jump into your welcome email, but I just want to do a quick recap on what we covered. Okay. We talked about your freebie. You create a really solid freebie. You set up your lead ad using the image and copy framework that we just went through. And then what's going to happen is people are going to give you their name and email and you're going to send a welcome email. And this is the most important email that you send. Why? Because here's the thing you have just interrupted somebody with your Facebook Ad. Okay. I call Facebook Ad jokingly interruption marketing. People aren't on Facebook, if we just follow with that same example, looking to fix their debt. They're looking for escapism. They're looking to get away from reality. They're looking to connect with their friends and family really. Maybe they're on there in their Facebook groups, you know, that might be about debt, but for the most part 80 to 90 percent of the time we're on there to just escape reality.

[00:17:50.910] - Zach
So if you have grabbed their attention with good copy and an image that connects with them, and they have given you their name and email they're seeking to fix a problem now, right. This is a great chance to move them into the world, into your world, because they've actively said even though I'm in a position where I don't want to be bothered you can bother me. You have their permission. You have their buy-in, and so this is a key email in your sequence. And here's what I do in my first email. So, take a note of this. Screenshot this. Write it down. But in my first email out to all my new leads, I give them the freebie. I remind them why they should trust me by establishing my authority again. I share my content flow. So as bloggers, you are probably blogging on a tri-weekly, bi-weekly, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly basis. You're putting out new content. When you put out new content, I recommend that you email your list, right. So tell them that you're going to be emailing them. I drop a new blog post every Thursday all around conquering debt. I'll be sure to send that to you.

[00:18:59.410] - Zach
 Set the expectation on your regular email content. Then invite them to your social media, whether that be Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. Say, if you're not already following me over there click the link below. I recommend one. Choose your most important, most frequent and most engaged social media platform where you want to spend most of your time and send them there. Then if you have an offer, you can put it in here. So you don't have to like --you're not pitching it. You're not selling it. I really don't recommend anything over $50 to $100 to start. But if you've got a basic offer, you can share about it, right. So like let's say you got the debt pay-off master class and it's $67, right, you could put that in here that's like, hey, if you're looking to pay off your debt, I do have this awesome masterclass. Feel free to check it out. Click here. It's like a one to two sentence blurb just a peak curiosity, right. We're not selling at this point. We're just telling them who we are, what we have to offer. Then wrap up the email. So great to connect with you. Can't wait to see you paying off your debt.

[00:20:03.820] - Zach
And then sign off, you know, X. X. Carmen or X. O. X. O. Carmen or sincerely Carmen or, you know, let's be debt-free together, Carmen, right, whatever -- however you want to sign off your emails. So again, to recap, this is such an important email because you have like -- you have their attention. So first and foremost, give them what they came for your freebie. If they have to search for it in the email, they'll leave. Most people are going to read this email, so establish authority similar to how we did in the ad. Tell them how to stay connected to your content and when to expect emails from you. Give them a call to action to join you on your top social media platform. Tell them what your offer is and give them a call to action to join you on a waitlist or check it out now. Waitlist is going to be better if you have a high ticket offer. So like I mentioned earlier, I prefer to be under $100 for this particular call out. But if you've got a high ticket offer that you launch a couple of times a year, you can also do a waitlist. Remind them you're excited. Tell them you'll email more soon and then sign off, right.

[00:21:01.770] - Zach
Have a fun or professional sign off, whatever makes most sense for your audience, right. So when I do a new email sequence, I take the lead ads and I sequence them. So a sequence is simply a set of emails that got automatically after someone joins my email list, right. So, what I do is I'm setting it up so that people who are on my email list are getting a set of emails or who just joined my email list are getting a set of emails. So what I do is quite simply I make an offer every other email, right. Every other email I'm making an offer. So I'm saying email number one is my freebie introduction email. Email number two is like a piece of content maybe one of my best blogs or my best resources that I've ever made that's free. I'm going to give it to them for free just to build that goodwill. And then email three, I'm going to make an offer. Come join my waitlist. Come buy my product. Come get my thing, right. I'm going to make them an offer, right. Now, I recommend that you start with ConvertKit to run your email sequence. It's affordable. It has automation.

[00:22:08.420] - Zach
But again, absolutely anything can do this. But this is my core fundamental email flow. Okay. And I know you might be thinking, Zach, this class that was about ads and you talked a little bit about copy and creative and running them. But here's the thing. I don't want you out in the world running Facebook Ads to grow your email list without this in place, right. Yes, we talked copy. Yes, we talked creative. I even showed you that little screenshot of the Ads Manager about the options to choose. But if you start running ads to grow your list and this doesn't exist, you won't make money. You'll be spending money to grow a list, right. So people like to say, the money is in your list -- the money is in your list. But the reality is the potential money is in your list. If you put this in place, you can actually generate leads, sales, waitlisters, and profits from your new leads. So immediately we send out the opt-in, right, the freebie. Then I do a value bridge, and this is where I basically say, hey, thank you so much for grabbing my freebie. I hope you're enjoying it.

[00:23:07.590] - Zach
By the way, I've got this great piece of content that you want to check out. That piece of content will typically, for me, be a blog or a podcast where I'm also presenting a product within the blog or podcast. It's not a blog or a podcast about a product. It just includes a product which the next day I will pitch that product. Again, if it's a higher ticket product, I'm pitching the waitlist. Then the next email, I share some of my top tips. For me, I always have a blog or a podcast about my top tips around something, and then again, four days later is my final automated call to action where I'm saying, hey, don't forget to get on the waitlist. Don't forget to buy my product, right. Now, after this, you're still going to email them weekly. Okay. You're still going to email them weekly and you're still going to send them all your content. But start here. Okay. So just to run through these, you've got your freebie email, your welcoming email which we talked about, but the value bridge connects a new subscriber to a highly valuable piece of content, okay, blog, podcast.

[00:24:06.970] - Zach
The goal is to cement your authority, but also itch their scratch, right. What are they struggling with? What is the freebie about? If it's about debt, don't send them a blog post about credit cards, right. Third email pitches your waitlist, right, your sales offer or your waitlist. Okay. This can be stories, testimonials, calls to action, but give them a good reason to join. Okay. Give them a reason to buy your product or join your waitlist. Top tip email, very similar to the value bridge email this is an email about giving them a top tip that goes deeper on in your offer, right. So don't just choose, again, like I'm very intentional about my emails, don't just choose a random tip. Give them a tip that relates to the product you sell, right. And then finally is your final call to action. So if they haven't bought a product or they haven't gotten on your waitlist, make a case for why they should, right. It doesn't need fake scarcity. It doesn't mean need a special countdown timer or this is your last chance ever. It's just a solid pitch that says, hey, I just wanted to remind you one last time to grab this thing.

[00:25:17.090] - Zach
I'll be talking about it more in June, December, whatever, but grab it now if you want, right. So again, deliver that freebie. Bridge them to a piece of value. Make an offer. Talk about your top tip related to your offer and make that offer again, right. So what's next? If you're watching this and you're like, what do I do now, Zach? So create your ads.
