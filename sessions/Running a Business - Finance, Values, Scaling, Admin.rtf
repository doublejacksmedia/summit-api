[00:00:13.370] - Amy\
Hey, everyone. Welcome. I'm so excited you're here. I'm Amy Edge, and today, I'm going to be sharing with you the key to your team's growth and how to unlock your leadership gifts, so you can really lead your team to success.\
\
[00:00:31.410] - Amy\
This is going to be applicable to you whether you only have one virtual assistant, a small and mighty team, or maybe even a massive Amy poor field size team. I want to quickly share about my background. So, you know why you should listen to me about your team's growth and development structure. I think myself as the quintessential best friend of change makers.\
\
[00:01:05.390] - Amy\
I typically complement those blue sky audacious goals of my visionary counterparts with my detailed approach to business. I blend my skills of project management, team leadership and a get shit done attitude into the equation to help achieve and exceed their business goals. And through this strategic partnership to help businesses increase profit, empower their teams and scale their businesses to create generational wealth that supports and empowers our future entrepreneurs while building their own legacy. I want to make sure you get the most out of the session, so please take a moment and put your phones on a do not disturb mode.\
\
[00:01:51.000] - Amy\
Close out those other tabs and get ready to take some notes. Alright, let's go ahead and get started and dive into what I'm going to cover and what you're going to learn today. I'm going to be covering how to shift your focus to creating a healthy culture for your team, vision and clarity for increased team engagement, and how to coach your team to their optimal performance. So, let's get started. So, we're going to start with shifting your focus to creating a healthy team culture.\
\
[00:02:25.660] - Amy\
A healthy culture is an ecosystem of healthy relationships. The problem is, we heavily define our culture from the onset in which it then inhibits real culture from flourishing. Real culture is healthy thriving relationships between each person. And our main focus should be on how can we facilitate interaction, healthy relationships, connection and conversation between our team members. Culture is a living, breathing organism. It changes and evolves every day.\
\
[00:03:09.750] - Amy\
It's built out of these relationships. And although, we've had to reinvent how we connect, and change, and pivot over the last few years, relationships are not gone from the workplace. They're not gone from the small businesses. They've not been removed from the virtual team.\
\
[00:03:35.830] - Amy\
Culture is also not a goal that you're going to try and create. Instead, you're going to blend the relationships that are coming together and transform into this living organism that then turns into the culture of your team. When there is that willingness to connect and to belong, that is really where the relationships and the connections are going to begin to happen naturally and for a community for your team to thrive without you, there must be a willingness and an eagerness for each of the people on your team.\
\
[00:04:16.750] - Amy\
Each of the people that you contract or hire want to connect with each other. Vulnerability is the key and the first step in a point of connection between two people. And you as the leader, need to move this forward.\
\
[00:04:45.410] - Amy\
This is why it's so important that when you are hiring, you are having multiple interviews in that hiring process. It's how you're really going to identify, is this person going to be a great component for the team that you're building? You're going to begin here by setting the standard and being vulnerable first by sharing your vision for them and then asking them what is the vision that they have for themselves and sharing this will not only show you if they will uphold your core values, and eagerly step into your community, and your team, and your business that you're building, but it's also going to show you, does their vision align with yours?\
\
[00:05:35.420] - Amy\
And that is the true key here.\
\
[00:05:38.860] - Amy\
We want each team member to come together and row in the same direction. No one person is rowing harder than the other, and we're working together. This really leads into our next point here in regards to vision and clarity, and this is absolutely needed to increase the team engagement that you see within your business. Team engagement is really defined as the degree into which your team, your employees, however your business is created, are motivated by passionate about and invested in the work that they do. This engagement also indicates the individual's commitment to the company that they are working with and their emotional connection to the people that they are working with.\
\
[00:06:35.490] - Amy\
So, the first step in this is casting our vision. This is the lifeblood of your team. Work is no longer about metrics. It's no longer about a paycheck. People want to bring about societal change and experience, personal development and growth, and your team is tasked with using their time, their energy and their expertise within your company.\
\
[00:07:08.100] - Amy\
That's going to have a positive mission to benefit the world. That is the key to building this cohesive engagement within your company, is having all people on the same page through the vision casting process. So, we need to make our vision statement clear and bold. This helps bring about clarity within the team within the business. This is going to explain how the success of your company is going to change the world. And clarity is built through not only sharing the vision but also through adequate and effective communication. So, communication is, creating these resources while at the same time producing a bonding effect within the team.\
\
[00:08:10.140] - Amy\
Clear lines of communication and boundaries have to be drawn and this has to be part of the very first interaction with your company as part of the onboarding process. By increasing these lines of communication among the team members, you're also going to be increasing the lines of responsibility between them as well. So, we can promote healthy communication of your team in multiple ways. So, here's a couple of examples. You could simply add ten minutes to your team meetings just for a check in.\
\
[00:08:47.090] - Amy\
This makes team members more comfortable to talk to you as a leader as you're their leader. We love to use this share win with our team when we get ready to start a meeting. So, the wins that we share could be personal. It could be business, but we're creating conversation while allowing everyone to engage, and interact, and become more familiar with the team that maybe we only see and communicate with virtually. Another way you can foster healthy communication is by having brainstorming sessions with your team.\
\
[00:09:28.290] - Amy\
This allows people to think creatively without fear, without judgment. And brainstorming fast tracks individual growth and helps get your team straight to the collaboration stage instead of everyone working within a Silo. So, those two things are incredibly important because we need both of those in order to coach our team to optimal performance. You know a great leader is a great coach. A coach in this instance is the facilitator of learning. It is us clearing the path, providing encouragement and helping the individual try and try again until they reach their fullest potential within the team\
\
[00:10:13.710] - Amy\
within the company.\
\
[00:10:15.290] - Amy\
Coaching essentially believes that each person is an Acorn and that you have your blueprint inside of you rather than being an empty vessel that is waiting to be filled. The coach's here, the leader is here to create the environment that's needed for this optimal growth, this optimal performance in the company. That includes safety, vulnerability, resources, communication, feedback, and also resistance, which is incredibly important. So, when you are coaching your team, when you are leading your team, you have a few goals that you need to ensure that you're reaching, which are awareness, responsibility and objectivity.\
\
[00:11:09.830] - Amy\
So, within awareness,\
\
[00:11:11.220] - Amy\
your job is to create and cultivate it within the team, so you can only control what you are aware of. What you are aware of, you can then control.\
\
[00:11:29.270] - Amy\
How do you become aware of what is happening within the business, right? You're measuring, you're visualizing, you're defining, and you're doing this by asking questions. For instance, if I wasn't here for this problem, what would you do? If you knew the answer, what could that be? Right?\
\
[00:11:53.930] - Amy\
We need to coach responsibility. We do this by asking for permission before giving advice. They're going to then listen and not just hear and wait and respond. They're going to ask for accountability and a commitment to and from the team. And there is no true objectivity in the world as us as humans. We're always going to be presented and faced with our own underlying values and prejudices and beliefs and limits and beliefs that we hold personally.\
\
[00:12:33.620] - Amy\
So, we need to ensure that when we're talking to our team, we are leading our team. We're never asking them something that we haven't asked ourselves. Right? We're always working towards self awareness, self responsibility, self coaching so that we can really effectively lead our team. Here's the big news flash here.\
\
[00:13:05.870] - Amy\
It's never them. It's most likely you, right. As a business owner, your goal every day is to lead an effective team. And our team cannot read our minds yet we often subconsciously expect them to. Right. So, it's important for our team to strive for excellence, but you cannot lead your team.\
\
[00:13:36.700] - Amy\
If you are creating a culture of micromanaging. Micromanaging is not the answer. Micromanaging is unsustainable, and building a team around you is going to eventually lead to burnout. You know as difficult as it is to hear, the problem really is not your team. It's you. It's the expectations that you set for your team members.\
\
[00:14:02.990] - Amy\
I've seen it way too often where business owners hire to patch up problems, they end up building their team completely around themselves. This is what happens. Like Your team is going to crumble without you. If you build your company and your team structure in this way. When we establish ourselves as the center cog in the wheel, all eyes fall on us, all communication, all resources, all expectations will sit with us. And without you, no one will know what to do or how to do it.\
\
[00:14:49.620] - Amy\
And such you begin the cycle of micromanaging just to get things done. Micromanaging does not get an efficient team. Micromanaging your team leads them to constantly relying on you to give them step by step by step detailed instructions.\
\
[00:15:12.730] - Amy\
This leads the team members to reaching for the bar you've already set up for them while also having no self responsibility. You become their crutch even though it's not personal or even probably intentional. As an entrepreneur, your leadership is so strong, it's so powerful, but it can cause you to steamroll your team and your company at times. So, instead, I want you to leave today understanding these pieces of how you can truly unlock your team's success and challenge them to make them believe in themselves as much as they believe in you.\
\
[00:16:02.590] - Amy\
I'm going to leave you guys today with this amazing quote.\
\
[00:16:07.590] - Amy\
I'm not quite sure who said it, but your job as a leader is to give responsibility, not take responsibility. So, I want to ask you what actions are you going to take today? What action are you going to take this week, this month, to shift your focus to creating the healthy culture, to instilling your vision and clarity for increased engagement and to coach your team to optimal performance? I'd love for you to Journal on that and send it over to me if you want feedback, if you want support, if you have questions, my email is here at the bottom.\
\
[00:16:48.020] - Amy\
Hello@amyedge.com.\
\
[00:16:50.090] - Amy\
Thanks for having me and I hope to chat with you soon.\

[00:00:00.460] - Cara Harvey\
I'm super excited to chat with you today on how to use AI to organize, plan, and get things done in your business. My name is Cara Harvey. I'm a Productivity Coach for Work at Home Moms, and I'm going to show you how I've been able to use my Dream Learn Plan Do Framework and couple it together with AI to work smarter and not harder. If you've been in business for even a day, you've probably heard of ChatGPT. That's the tool we're going to talk about today. This is a tool that can make things work faster for you because I always tell people we're stuck staring at the blank cursor. We don't know where to get started. And if that has felt like you, don't worry, I've got you today. Okay. Things that we're going to cover: we're going to talk about how to make a vision for your business using AI, in particular ChatGPT; I'm going to talk to you about how you can use it to figure out a learning plan you know all those things you don't know yet in your business; we're going to figure out how we can know what we don't know and make a plan for it.\
\
[00:01:03.360] - Cara\
We're going to talk about how to make standard operating procedures, workflows, task breakdowns, and how to make sure you're managing your time more efficiently because of what the AI has taught you. If this sounds like you, you're in the right spot. Okay. Have you ever sat down and thought I just want to know what to do. I have all this time. My kid's finally napping. What am I supposed to be doing? Or maybe you felt like I want to work on my business. I want to make progress in all of the things but like I'm just overwhelmed. Or I'm not sure how to help people. Like I know that I want to help them with this idea, but do they even want that? Or I just don't know how to make my business work. Have you ever thought I'm just struggling to figure out how to keep things organized so I feel like I'm wasting time. If you've ever been in any of these boats, trust me, I understand. I've been there. And I'm going to show you how I've started in the past year to use the AI with my frameworks as a tool to make things just a ton easier.\
\
[00:01:56.490] - Cara\
I'm Cara Harvey. I call myself an accidental entrepreneur. I was a school teacher for 10 years, and I absolutely loved what I did except I started to burnout. I was working 60 hours a week. I wasn't putting any time in for me. And what I realized was I needed to figure out a system to help me do exactly this work smarter, not harder. So, I got into network marketing. That's how I got started on my journey. And I did that full-time for about two years, and then listen, on the outside, it looked very successful, right. I had 250 people on my team, six-figure business. But then on the inside, I realized that I was doing all the same things that burnt me out in teaching -- carrying my laptop around. Um, you know, I had to get to inbox zero before bed. I was neglecting my family. And so about six years ago now, I decided to switch gears and I started what we call A Purpose Driven Mom. And my mission here at APDM is to help work-at-home moms figure out how they can work on their personal goals, manage their homes and their families while growing, starting or scaling an online business without sacrificing themselves without feeling like they have to hustle all the time, and without the shame that can often come accompanied with that mom guilt, right.\
\
[00:03:02.350] - Cara\
I'm the author of the book The 15 Minute Formula, How Busy Moms Can Ditch the Guilt, Say Yes to What Matters, and Conquer Their Goals. And I'm the host of the internationally top-ranked podcast the Purpose Driven Mom show, and I've been there. I understand what it's like to start a business and not know what to do. And AI is obviously a newer tool for all of us in the online space. But the past year, I've started to incorporate it in my goal setting programs, and it's been so much fun to allow myself to just think out of the box. Sometimes we stare at our business for so long it doesn't make sense to us. We get so stuck in what we think it's supposed to be. And I have figured out how to use AI as a tool that makes me feel a little bit more in control, all right. So, I want you to ask yourself a question. On a scale of one to ten, how clear would you say you are right now with what your business looks like day to day? What we're going to do is hopefully take you from a one to a three or a three to a five or five to seven.\
\
[00:03:56.940] - Cara\
I want to give you some tips that are going to help the day to day ins and outs of your business feel easier. That's always the goal. How can we set up systems? I'm a systems junkie. I want to show you how you can set up systems to make things feel much more aligned, all right. Now, I want to talk to you about why AI, and in particular ChatGPT is what I'm going to show you because ChatGPT is one of my favorite free tools. And I work with a lot of newer entrepreneurs who are getting in the startup so they don't have a lot of money to invest. So, I want to show you why you can use ChatGPT and AI and how can make it easier. When I was a school teacher, I taught English, and I taught special education and a lot of my kids had learning disabilities and we would be writing paragraphs. They'd work on their senior project essays and they would always feel stuck because they didn't know what to write. And I would tell them it's the start that stops us. So, one of the things I started to do was I started to put sentence starters like paragraphs like in addition, for example, secondly, right onto their desk --\
\
[00:04:53.310] - Cara\
it was taped on their desk. And so when they were writing, they didn't have to think of every idea. They would have a little bit of a head start. I could just pick one of these words and then my brain can move. I find it is very similar in my business. Sometimes when I'm staring at the blank cursor, I just don't know. And here's what's so interesting. I think we know as business owners in our hearts and in our minds we know what we want to do. We know how we want to help people. We know what we want it to look like, right. But when it's time to open up the laptop and start working, we get so stuck because we're just staring at the blank screen. My hope for you is that you can see the prompts, and I'm going to give you lots of prompts today. You can see the prompts that I'm going to give you as a tool. I want to say this as well. AI is a tool. It is not a replacement for you. There are people who need what you have to give, right. There's all this controversy about AI taking over things -- like I'm an author.\
\
[00:05:43.900] - Cara\
I'm not worried about it. Why? Because it is not a human being. It is a great tool just like my calendar or my planner is a tool, right. Just like Trello, which is something I'll show you a little bit of today, is a tool that's going to help me figure out how to work smarter in my business. You need to customize. Don't just copy, paste and think you're done. You need to go through the thought process. Now, the other thing I want to say before we get started is I'm going to show you a couple of ways of keeping organized, but I also am going to make sure that I stop on each slide if you want to take a screenshot. The screenshots are going to have the prompts that you can put in. If you've never used ChatGPT, don't worry about it. I'm also going to show you how to do it in ChatGPT. But I just want you to know, as I'm going through, take that screenshot. Use these prompts for later. Save them for later, all right. Now, here are some tips for using ChatGPT in particular. If you've never seen it, I'm going to click over to it.\
\
[00:06:37.910] - Cara\
This is what ChatGPT looks like, right. You can click a new chat up at the top and they give you a ton of prompts. So you could go in and you could search different prompts, right, one click course creator, Instagram, post carousel content. There are so many templates. If you just kind of search through, it will really help you not have to think. If I'm going to write Facebook ads, I would go to here. Cool, let's talk about a Facebook ad hook. Help me out because I don't want to waste time trying to figure out what to do when I can get a tool that will help me figure out my next steps. Okay. So there's tons of prompts you can search through here. You just go through your topic and you go here. But you can also give them your own. So when you're down here -- and I'm currently using the free plan because I want to make sure that anything I show you can do on the free plan, but I would recommend you upgrade. It's not that expensive to upgrade because you can change a lot of different styles. You get more prompts and things like that. I think it's like $20 a month. Okay.\
\
[00:07:36.420] - Cara\
But when you're here, like I said, you can change the tone, the writing style. There's all different ones for output. You're going to type in a prompt and it's going to give you a few things. Now, here is my recommendations. Let's head back to this slide. One is first, before we do any of these, you need to tell ChatGPT who you want it to be. Okay. Pretend you are a online course creator who helps work-at-home moms manage their time, home, families, and business, right. Tell it who you want to be. The more that you use ChatGPT the more it will get to know your specific business. Okay. So you have to just give it some time. You're going to want to be very specific like I just said. Tell it exactly who to be. Don't give yes or no. Right? Open ended. I'm interested in finding out 10 podcast title ideas for helping moms get their newborns to sleep. Right, open ended. Also, you're going to want to experiment with the different prompts. I'm going to give you specific prompts. But again, look at all these ones here. Scroll through. Look at the different ones that you have. Search things, you know, to figure it out.\
\
[00:08:45.520] - Cara\
If you're trying to, let's see, use LinkedIn, here we go we've got LinkedIn. So, just search through. Try different prompts until you kind of get what you're looking for. You're also going to want to, again, set the tone, you know, give me this in a motivational way. Give me this concisely -- however you want to be and give it the constraints. I would like this in an outline form. Please give me 10 of these things. And again, ask for multiple options and also expanding. If you like something, say you did that example I just gave you, give me 10 podcast title ideas for a parenting coach -- oh, I can't remember is that what, that's what it is -- for a parenting coach of toddlers. If you like that, you can then say great thank you. I was using manners, right? Can you give me more that sound like and copy the one that you like. Number three, you know, potty training tips, can you give me 10 more here? Continue to expand on it. The other tip I'm just going to give you before we dive into prompts because this is going to be a fast and furious presentation, is timers. Use a Timer.\
\
[00:09:51.510] - Cara\
You could get sucked into ChatGPT. So you're going to want to really use a timer to figure out where you're supposed to be and what you're supposed to be doing so that you're not going down that rabbit hole. Okay. Now, I want to really quickly show you my Dream-Learn-Plan-Do framework. This is the framework I use whenever I'm working on a new project. And today I'm going to walk and give you a ton of prompts based on Dream Learn Plan and Do. A lot of times new entrepreneurs will get into their business and they'll just want to go to the do. Just let me do the thing. But if you don't spend time dreaming, what do you want it to look like, learning, figuring out what you don't know, planning, creating workflows, doing, making your batches, when it is time to get started, you're not going to know what to do. So I'm going to walk you through this process and show you parallel of how it works with my method. Okay. Before we get there, I just want to show you how to keep it organized. You could use a Google Doc, whatever.\
\
[00:10:39.650] - Cara\
I use Trello. And what I really like about Trello -- I'm going to go back to ChatGPT, for example, I was making this presentation and I use ChatGPT. And so -- let's see if this will load for me. Just taking a second. Hold on. Let me -- let me go into a different one and see if that was -- okay, so this was one that I did for a client of mine. We were on a coaching call, and this was what she needed. I'm a business owner who helps preschool, early elementary moms. I want to come up with a product I can sell for five dollars that works any time of the year. Can you give me 20 ideas? And on the coaching call we asked it. And what I want to show you is really cool is you can just copy what you've got here and paste it in wherever, oops, and paste it in wherever you want. Now you can do a doc. I really like Trello. Trello is a free tool that you can use. And the reason I like it is because I can make a list here. Let's pretend this is ChatGPT prompts here. I can just hit add a card put it in and it's going to ask me, hey, do you want to make three cards?\
\
[00:11:33.080] - Cara\
And it will copy and paste over exactly what ChatGPT told me. And then if I want, I can just three dots or archive that list because this way I don't lose it. Yes, I could come back into my ChatGPT and I could read it, but I would rather have it in front of me. Okay. So, I want you to just think of how you want to keep it organized. All right, let's jump into some prompts. Shall we? Dream phase one -- actually, let me make this a little bit smaller so you could see. There we go. It all on one page. So in the dream phase, you might ask yourself who do you want to help. Here are some example prompts. Again, take that screenshot that you could put in that would give you so much information. And again, why do we do this in the dream phase? Because if you're going through and really doing market research and content planning, when it's time to record that YouTube video, you know what to do, right. So inside the way you'll see these is if it's in brackets, you're going to fill in the blank for your specific niche or whatever it is, right.\
\
[00:12:26.940] - Cara\
So I work with ideal client to help them, things you help them with, and I ultimately achieve -- what's the goal? Who are my main competitors? Why do you want to do this? Because this is going to help you see what other people are doing to get ideas. Maybe you don't even know what your business idea is. Identify 10 niches that'd be interested in purchasing whatever my service is. What are some pain points of my niche, right? I help moms who want to live a toxin free lifestyle. What are their pain points? What is this telling me? It's going to tell me the content for my podcast, my YouTube, my social media. What's a really fun one is you do a buyer persona. So if you tell it a little bit about who you want to help, really get in there, it'll give you this whole buyer persona about that person. And whenever you're writing content, you can think about that person, all right. This is a really good one too, objections. Why do most ideal clients, right, who deserve, you know, who -- whatever they desire fail to get the result. Why? If you know that, you can use that in your content.\
\
[00:13:25.900] - Cara\
Some other prompts you can use, right. What types of courses could appeal to that person? What are their limiting beliefs? When you can identify this, and I think this is where messaging gets a lot easier, is because you can be like, right, they are struggling this with this. We get so tied in and so close to our own stuff that we often forget it, right. So then this way, we're asking, hey, you know, why are they struggling? What's their problem? What's their brain telling them? And then you can combat that in, in your marketing. So take a screenshot of this one too. Right? I work with who? What are their platforms that are most likely that they're going to be on -- helpful things, all right. Now, ChatGPT it's not actually connected to the Internet in a way that isn't, isn't have 2023, 2024, it's not going to have recent data, but it's going to have some good enough stuff which is why, again, you're not just going to take the whole content plan and copy it to a T. You need to still know your person. But when you're in the dream phase, you can use the AI to give you ideas of what should your course be about?\
\
[00:14:24.130] - Cara\
What should that e-book be? What should my Facebook post be? My Instagram? My TikTok, et cetera? Now, here are some prompts. Again, take a copy -- a screenshot on how to create content. This is going to help you, right. What are some tips that as an expert in what you are can give that person about topic or pain point because so often we get so close to our own stuff that we forget. Right? Here's a great one, the last one. The main benefit of my program for my ideal clients is whatever it is, give me 10 fears that my ideal client might have with this. You can then talk about that on your social. And if you're letting it come up on ChatGPT, you can just copy it into Trello. Copy it into a doc. Make it easy for you. Here is some more about creating content, right. What are trending topics, right, in my industry? Can you give me some engaging questions or polls that I can ask? What's some behind-the-scenes content that they would actually care about? Upcoming holiday events? Or can I have some inspirational messages that would resonate with my brand's values of and you put the values in.\
\
[00:15:29.200] - Cara\
And this is where you have to say does this work or not. This is where you have to tweak based on what you need and what doesn't work for you. Okay. So go through. Go into ChatGPT. I'm going to switch over. And inside your new stuff, let's say, we'll make our new chat again. Type them in. See what it says. Right? And you can even -- I haven't primed this one, but we can say like, hey -- what did I say before? I am an online coach who helps entrepreneurs grow their Instagram following. Right? Let's pretend that's you, right. What are -- I like please give me 10 Instagram story topics that would help me connect with them -- connect with my audience. Right? So see here it's giving you the ideas. Let's see what comes up. And here you go. You can use these however you want to use them. It's giving you tips. It's giving you ideas. And again, it's not going to answer every question. What it's going to do is it's going to help you have to think less, all right. Now, we're going to talk about how to use AI for my learn phase. Learning is so important because we don't know what we don't know until we get started.\
\
[00:16:49.460] - Cara\
And then you're like, oh, I'm going to start a YouTube channel, but you don't know all the steps. So how do you know what you want to learn? You don't until you get started. So if you ask AI, it give you some ideas so you can make a learning plan. You might want to say, I want to write a book this year, but I don't know all the things I need to learn. So what if I ask AI to help me? Here are some prompts that you can screenshot. I'm an expert on write I am a whatever you are. When I say expert status, like whatever it is you do. I'm a productivity coach for work for moms, right. What are the key market research techniques and tools I need to understand my audience better? This is going to tell you. Here are some areas that you might want to go, hey, I don't know anything about SEO. Right? I don't know anything about podcast search engines. I want to learn them. What are financial skills and strategies I need? What are the latest digital marketing strategies, right? You're going to see this. It might come up with something. Instagram Threads came out in 2023.\
\
[00:17:39.620] - Cara\
You might want to decide you want to learn for Instagram Threads. You can also ask them as a expert role, status, whatever you, how can I improve my sales skills? Why don't I come up with some messaging things or things you might want to learn. And all you're going to ask yourself is, is this something that fits into my learning plan? Is this something I need to learn about? How can I effectively develop or launch, right? This is who I am; this is who I help, and this is what I help them with. So maybe they say webinars. Maybe they say paid challenges. You might want to look into that. Time management techniques. You might want to ask about leadership skills. You might want to ask just about keeping yourself organized. It'll give you some ideas. Again, take a screenshot of this. The goal here is to use the prompts to just think through. I don't even know what I need to learn yet. You can ask it, what are the steps I need to start a YouTube channel? And it'll give you all the steps, and we're going to talk about in the next section.\
\
[00:18:33.290] - Cara\
But based on those steps, you can then say, oh, I know I need to learn these things. I need to go find a course or a YouTube channel or a podcast on it. Now, our next phase is called plan. Planning is my favorite stage, but a lot of us get stuck in it. Planning can be so easy when you use ChatGPT because what planning is going to do is help you set up your standard operating procedures, your workflows, your batches, all of the tasks that you actually need to do. So, here are some prompts we're going to start with. Take a screenshot of goals, things that you can ask the AI to help you make a really great vision. What are some tasks that I should be doing once a year? You can see on here I've got yearly, quarterly, monthly because there are things that you should be doing once a year: changing your disclosure page, updating your privacy policies. You might need to send W9s to your -- any affiliates that you have, right, things like that. But there might be things you need to do quarterly or monthly. You can ask it, what are the monthly metrics that might be important?\
\
[00:19:31.940] - Cara\
Like this is what I do. What should I be tracking? What are some tasks I should be doing every month administratively? You can even get specific and say, what are tasks that I should be completing every month for social media in my business for my podcast in my business. Right? These are really important things because it's going to allow you to plan out goals appropriately. And again, this goes back to learn. You don't know what you don't know. It's going to allow you to then say, hey, I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing once a year. Now I can kind of get a better understanding. Now, I want to talk a little bit about standard operating procedures. And if you're newer in the business like a lot of the people I work with, you might not even know what these are or what you need. This is basically the manual for your business. You want to create these from the beginning. This is the step-by-step workflow of everything in your business. And trust me when I say that having SOPs in our business lets everything run smoother. We have done a similar launch multiple times. Launch becomes easier every time you do it because you get smoother.\
\
[00:20:28.280] - Cara\
I can hand my SOP over to someone on my team and they can do it without me. When a podcast episode goes up, we know the steps. So look through this list here. It's obviously not comprehensive, but it's got a lot of really good ideas. Do you know the steps for employee onboarding in your business? Client onboarding -- somebody buys from you, then what happens? Do you know what your blog workflow process is? When you have a launch or a summit or an event? Do you have a data SOP? If you don't, these might be ones that you want to create. Now, don't feel like you need to create every single one right away. But you might want to kind of go through and create the ones that are most relevant to you as you go. Just a pro tip on this. We always use the free software, Loom, L-O-O-M.com. You can screen record as you talk through yourself doing it and create them. And then you can get a transcript of what you're doing. So how do you use the AI in that? You just ask it. I want to create a standard operating procedure for my business in whatever area it is.\
\
[00:21:27.440] - Cara\
Please write an outline for me. All right, so I want to show you this. Let's use this prompt here. I'm going to copy it over. Okay. ChatGPT is going to help you get started. Right? So, let's say, I want to create a standard operating procedure for my business and for my, we'll say, my podcast, for my podcast. Please, write it down for me the steps to complete this. All right, let's see what we get, and what ChatGPT is going to give me is all the steps to creating a podcast. And what you now can do is take these and turn these into a workflow. You can take these and turn these into your vision. So when it's time to sit down and work, you know today is I need to brainstorm out podcast titles. Tomorrow, I need to outline them. Right? Now, and you might not do every one of these steps. Now I need to do record. I need to do the interview. I need to make the images. It's all here for you. So this is so good if you're in the beginning of your business and you just don't know your steps yet. Okay. I want to create a workflow. So let's, you know -- this one's even more specific.\
\
[00:22:37.280] - Cara\
So, you could do it for a big project. But let's try a blog. I want to create a workflow for my blog posts. In what order should I complete tasks to get one blog post completed? And again, you just need to go through and read it and get the workflow, and it makes it for you. Then you can take something like this, you can copy it into something like a Trello board where, you know, we have a workflow method. This is a different board that I use, but you can have the workflow going and know what you're doing. It's going to keep you organized. Okay. Now, we're not going to really talk because this is such a fast presentation on the AI for do. But the do is the day-to-day. Right, it's your -- it's your -- you take it and you're making your schedule and you're going. But if you don't spend the time in dreaming, in learning, in planning, when you get to do, you're going to feel stuck. So, I recommend that you go through this process. You use these prompts to make a system. What I just showed you is a system. It's a system for organizing any project. If you have a launch coming up, you're making a new freebie, if you're getting a podcast episode, go through these steps.\
\
[00:23:43.010] - Cara\
Use the AI. Keep yourself organized. Work smarter, not harder. We covered a lot. So a couple of things you're going to want to map out in this upcoming week set up a place to keep your ChatGPT organized whether it's Trello or a doc. I want you to spend time using the prompts and researching 15 minutes. You're going to put on a timer. If you don't put on a timer, you're going to get super sucked in. And again, just remember, this is not replacing your brain. This is assisting your brain. It is just an assistant. It's just part of your flow. It is just part of your process and it is a tool. I'd love to connect more. You come over to my podcast The Purpose Driven Mom Show. We're also over on YouTube. You can search Purposed Driven Mom on my Instagram here. And if you want to learn more about my book or just get a free workbook that accompanies the book, go to the15minuteformula.com/free that's going to link over to a workbook that you get absolutely free. And it also will link to Amazon, Barnes and Noble if you want to come buy the book and learn more of these strategies.\
\
[00:24:34.660] - Cara\
Would love to connect with you more. DM me if you watch this today over on Instagram. Ask me your questions. Again, this is just one tool that I like to teach new business owners how to use in a systemized way. Not a get stuck down the rabbit hole, but it's all about the system.\

Chelsea Clarke [00:00:12]:\
Wow, guys. It's the 2025 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I can't believe it. Thank you so much for joining me here in this session, and a big thank you to Liz for putting together this event year after year. Love it so much, and I'm so grateful to get to be a part of it. Everyone here watching, welcome. Thank you for attending this session here. It's gonna be a little bit different than other virtual summit sessions that I have presented on in the past.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:00:40]:\
This one is really a tough conversation, but it's so important that we have it. The title of my presentation is I Scaled Too Fast and I Nearly Destroyed My Business. Here's Everything That I'm Doing in 2025 to fix my mess. I'm putting my heart on my sleeve here to fess up to all of the f ups that I made over the past few years that really caused, not the best shift in my business. And I am sharing everything that I'm doing now to fix those mistakes and enter the new year with a better plan, better systems. And I really have some big things to share that I believe is worth saying because I know that it will help someone watching this session here. Whether you are a new blogger or you have been blogging for years years years, these things are going to come up. So I hope that you can learn from my mistakes and walk away from this with some practical advice you can utilize in your own business, from things that I have learned from.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:01:48]:\
And please stick around and watch until the end because I have some really cool bonuses to share with you that you just can't get anywhere else. So you need to stick around. I want this to be super actionable, so I won't spend much time on my introduction here. I'll keep it super short and sweet. My name is Chelsea Clarke. I've been a full time content creator since 2016. I've been blogging since way before that since like 20, 2006, 2007. I was on Tumblr.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:02:18]:\
Hey, Tumblr girlies. But I didn't monetize my site and operate my blog as a business until 2016. So I have as I say, I've been a full time creator since then, and my main website is herpaperroute.com. This is where I help content creators thrive in the creator economy. And it's interesting that we're having this conversation today because so many changes have happened over the past few years in the creator economy that it's extra, extra important that we touch on all of the things that have been going on all of the shifts and how we can stay strong to weather those storms when they happen and not give up on content creation. I also founded a platform called Niche Investor. This is a marketplace where content creators buy and sell websites and blogs, online businesses. And I also have a home renovation blog and YouTube channel where I'm sharing the journey of renovating my home with my husband.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:03:13]:\
Husband. We are funding the renovation with a 100% from funds that we make in the creator economy. So my husband is a content creator as well and a woodworker. Now that we got all that out of the way, let's dive in. So let's go back to 2020 when the pandemic hits. Just very briefly. I won't stick around in that horrible year for too long. But the thing is, for business, it was not horrible.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:03:36]:\
For business, especially in the creator economy, in the online business world, it was really good. Business was thriving in our industries. And this is partially because, well, more people were stuck at home. They were scrolling on their computers and phones. They had more time to start a business, to start a blog. There was a bigger audience. There was a captive audience. People were looking for other ways to get money because they maybe their hours got cut back or they lost their job in the pandemic.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:04:07]:\
So they were starting businesses. They were researching side hustles. They were learning how to get control of their revenue and financial future. And so in our industries, it was great. People were buying courses. People were buying all sorts of things. We were having virtual summits, and tons of people were turning out to those summits. And it was just a really captive time to have your message be heard, to connect with people, to make online business friends.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:04:36]:\
Everything just felt very, like, it was just all happening. And because everything was so high engagement and felt like everything was really going well, a lot of us thought that it was gonna stay like that forever, myself included. I really thought that I had figured out the ticket to life that business was always gonna be going this well. So having that mindset at the time, I was like, I guess I should be scaling up. I should be hiring people. I should be putting lots of money into ad spend. I could be getting a PR team. And I started thinking about all these things and how I could ramp up my business because what was working then, I my the logic was if I apply more effort and more money into that, then maybe we could double it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:05:20]:\
Maybe we could triple it. And for the 1st year or so, yeah, that's what happened. That year, I made over $700,000, and I thought, well, it's just gonna be like this forever. Right? I think you kinda can guess where this is going. But here I had this money now to invest into my business. So what did I do? Well, everyone's saying, oh, you need to scale. You need to hire a coach who can get you to the next level. You need to invest in advertising, hire a team.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:05:54]:\
So in theory, these things are all good things. They can be when done right. But I did it too fast. My intuition was telling me when I thought about hiring a big team, my intuition was telling me probably can't afford it yet. Probably should probably slow down. But instead of listening to my intuition, I went ahead and I listened to social media. I listened to coaches. I listened to what people were suggesting you do when you get to that million mark, what you should be doing with your business.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:06:24]:\
Even though it didn't feel totally right to me. But I went ahead, and I hired a social media manager. I hired some content creators. I hired some writers. I hired hired a sales team, and I hired a PR team. And the job of the PR team was to get me mentioned in articles booked on podcasts and get some media appearances. And it was quite expensive to have them doing this. And I got a couple website mentions, and I got on a couple podcasts, but no big podcast and certainly no big media out of it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:07:01]:\
It just wasn't worth it. And after I think it was about 6 months, almost almost a year, actually, I was like, this is not working. I'm hiring a lot of people, and it's pushing me beyond what feels comfortable for paying everyone. There's a bit of conversations going around the Internet. People say, you know, hire before you need the help. But I think that that's not the full story of what people need to consider. You shouldn't be hiring before you can afford to really pay everyone. And, which I mean is kind of obvious, But it's also why I didn't hire a team for so many years, and I did everything as a solopreneur because I wasn't sure if I could pay them.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:07:40]:\
And now because I'm seeing more money coming in, I'm thinking, oh, well, I guess I can afford them. So I'm hiring all these people even though it didn't feel quite right. We'll get back to that in a moment because I made another mistake around this exact time, and that was hiring a coach that was way too much money that just wasn't the right kind of value in return. Now the coach that I hired is a completely legitimate businessperson, and by no means am I disparaging her business in any way. I would never do that to another business owner, to another creator. She's absolutely legitimate, and I really do like her. But the coaching package wasn't for me personally, so it was a mistake for me. And hiring a coach can be a wonderful thing.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:08:26]:\
This is also not to disparage the coaching industry in any way. If you can connect with someone, really vibe with them, and you're really getting what you need and the payment structure feels right to you, then absolutely. That's a great coaching situation. It just wasn't that way for me. And, unfortunately, I had I moved forward, and I signed on to the coaching program because I had seen things online saying, oh, when you're at that million mark, you need to hire someone who could take you to the $10,000,000 mark. And she was someone who has hit that 1$0,000,000 mark in her business. So I thought who better than this person? And I gave her $50,000 to, you know, learn how she's running her business. And, unfortunately, that's just not what I got out of it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:09:09]:\
And so that was a costly mistake for me. So the word of warning here is to really, really, really research anything that you sign up for, anything over $10,000, really, really, really, really be so careful with where you're spending your money. Because there are a lot of people that will just charge an exorbitant amount for their coaching program, like $20,000, $30,000, or $50,000 like I paid for. And you're just not necessarily guaranteed to get the type of support that you may need at the stage that you are at. And I had other coaches as well that I was paying for and and coaches that were not charging for their services, just, you know, mastermind style. This was a good thing. I was really being a sponge, and I I always wanna learn from different perspectives. So just being aware and listening to different people.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:09:58]:\
But my problem at this time was I was putting too much value into other people's, perspectives than my own. And instead of just taking what everyone, different coaches, and different business owners were recommending, and then internalizing that and thinking, okay. Well, what feels right to me? I just thought, okay. Well, these people are at, you know, 10 x where I'm at right now, so they must have all the answers. So I'm just gonna do exactly what they say, and that is a huge, huge mistake. So not only am I at this time hiring too many people that I'm not comfortable with being able to afford? But I'm also paying too much and listening too much to the perspectives of others even if it's going against what my intuition is telling me. So, again, this is gonna come that you're gonna see a theme now through this conversation. Listen to your intuition.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:10:45]:\
Your intuition knows what's up. Okay? So we that's that's what we need to do. We need to listen to what we're feeling in here and in here. And then also at this time, because scaling was my focus that that year, I'm thinking, where can I network more? Where can I do brand sponsorship where my brand is a sponsor and get in front of new audiences, which is a great thing to be thinking about? I just, again, did it too fast. I paid for hefty packages to be a brand sponsor at different events, to have a booth at different conferences. And, sure, I met some great people. It was a fun experience, and we got some brand recognition out. But the ROI, looking at the numbers, for me, it just wasn't worth it because I did too many too fast.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:11:34]:\
It really wasn't worth that ROI. I removed the personal touch of my business that my brand had been known and loved for. And really in this 2 year period, I was so removed from the business that it didn't feel like my own anymore, and I started to resent it, which is not cool. Not cool at all. My brand lost a little bit of its uniqueness during that time. So here we are. We're getting towards 2023 now, and I've got all of these big expenses going on. And sales started to go down.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:12:07]:\
It really started a noticeable change. There were less people turning up to workshops. There were less people signing up for things. There were less people enrolling in courses. It was a slow trickle, but it was noticeable. This is where it might get a little bit dark, but it's important to talk about because at some point, as business owners, you know, you might find yourself here or you already have been or you currently are, and you need to have a business recovery plan. I think I need to let some people go. I don't wanna do that.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:12:40]:\
This is the this is the part that was the toughest was to let people on my team go. What I did first was I cut my own salary. So before I could even take anyone off the team, I cut my own salary, and I ran the business for another 6 months seeing if maybe that would help. And I lowered some of my expenses that I could. So time is going on, and it's not really making a big enough cut. So I let the PR team go. I let the social media manager go. This is really, really, really tough.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:13:12]:\
I think all of us here watching, we really do care about the people that we work with, and we have a bond with them. It's not just you know, they're not just doing a job for you. You become friends with them. So it really, really sucks to have to let anyone on your team go. It would have been a lot easier if from the beginning I just didn't scale so fast, if I just didn't hire all these people so fast. Because having to fire later, sucks. It just sucks. I'm running my company with just a small team, but sales are just not where they need to be to be able to support the number of people that I have on my team.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:13:50]:\
Now I have stopped going to conferences. I have stopped sponsoring conferences. I have cut back my advertising spend, and I'm no longer working with the expensive coaches. So you would think that everything's gonna be fine. And I'm thinking, okay. Things are gonna pick up. Well, then the, helpful content update hits in Google, and it knocks out a ton of websites. And in my industry, we help website owners grow and monetize and sell their their sites.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:14:21]:\
So this was a really big shock to a lot of people. What it did was it slowed down the amount of people who were buying sites. It also slowed down the amount of people that were selling as well. I cut my own salary down lower because I didn't wanna fire anyone. I was reluctant to make any cuts for a very long time because I was hopeful that this was just gonna be a temporary thing. Sales in general, were going to bounce back. Every time that I had to sit down and do payroll, I would have a panic attack because I'm having to pay my team now not out of business earnings, but I'm having to pull out of business savings just to cover things, just to get through the month. And then in early 2024, I attended a retreat, And, honestly, I would not have gone on this retreat if the tickets had been refundable, but they weren't.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:15:13]:\
And I had purchased them almost a year before, when things were going well. So I had to go on this trip, and I am thankful that I did because the presentations at this retreat were really, really helpful. Every person there was sharing the same sentiment that business is tough right now. And this is not to be all doom and gloom. We're gonna we're gonna turn this around in a minute, but it is important that we talk about this. So when I'm at the retreat, which is a retreat for 6, 7, 8, 9 figure business owners, I was feeling like, why am I here? When I joined this group, I felt like I was up here with everybody, and now I'm, like, way down here. What am I even doing here? But listening to the presentations, by the end of the retreat, I realized we were all on the same boat. Everyone was saying it's been the tough tough year toughest year ever, with the changes in Google and just general after pandemic recession issues.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:16:12]:\
And so all of these people have had to make major cuts in their business. And, 2 people in their presentations were saying how they felt so pulled away from their business because when things were good, they had hired tons of people, to take care of everything, and they were no longer as involved in the business. And that's exactly how I had been feeling. Like, I my personal touch just wasn't there, which then resulted in me just kind of resenting my own business. Then in the conversations, it came up about letting people go on your team, having to make those cuts. And the sentiment seemed to be universal that everyone expressed how horrible it is to have to do that. But as soon as you do it, you get a sense of relief. And, you know, don't wait too long to let people go when you know what's the right thing to do even though it feels horrible and you don't wanna upset anyone.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:17:08]:\
If it needs to be done for your business, you need to do it. This part of my presentation here, it's like we need to scale back. We scale too fast. We need to go back to our roots. And you might not be feeling this, but this is exactly where I was at in the last year. I needed to get more involved in my business. I really missed the day to day. I missed content creation.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:17:31]:\
I love that. I love creating blog posts, and it had been so long since I had actually been able to create a blog post in my business. I had all of these other people doing this for my business. It just I didn't it didn't feel like mine anymore. So when I boarded the plane and I headed back home after that trip, I knew what I had to do. And so I made the very tough decision to let everyone on my team go except one key team member and the people in my family who work in the business. And for as hard as that was, when the next payday came around, there was no panic attack this time. I actually felt empowered.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:18:08]:\
I felt so good. And just knowing that there was an abundance of being able to pay everyone, and I you know, that stress was just removed from me. Moving into the new month, I now felt great. Like, I had this weight lifted off of me that now creativity was flowing in, and I was getting back into the grassroots of my business. I felt a full new just revived sense of I can do this. I wanna create. And so I just started writing like crazy and pinning, creating pins, and focusing on just creating new blog content. And it felt so good.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:18:47]:\
This is what I was doing back when I started my business, and I had taken so many steps to pull myself away from the content creation side of my business that it it got to a point where I wasn't really content creating in my content creator business. And now I was back and I was doing it and it felt so, so right. So we're not done just yet, but I do wanna do this quick little overview. Hiring mistakes, I hired too fast. Too many people more than I can afford. People were saying you need to scale. You need to hire. You need everyone taking care of everything on your list and in your business.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:19:19]:\
And that is not true. That's not a 100% true. It might be for some people, but you don't have to hire out and outsource so much that it no longer feels like your business. At least in my case, that's what I learned. And because of industry shifts, like the Google algorithm affecting websites, affecting the resale market, and affecting content creation, content creators' ad revenue and just everything. It's it's all comes together. Very, very, very important that you have multiple traffic sources on your website, multiple revenue streams on your website. Another mistake that I made personally was hiring coaches too fast and paying too much for coaching services when that wasn't really what I needed at the stage I was at.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:20:05]:\
I was listening to the voices circulating around on the Internet saying, when you, you know, when you hit a million, you need to hire a coach who can take you to 10,000,000, 20,000,000. And for many cases, that can be very helpful, but it was against my intuition because it didn't feel quite right to me. It wasn't the right match for me with coat with the coaches that I hired. And because the industry was changing so much at that time, it just wasn't the right situation for me to have those coaches. So listening to others over my own intuition and over your own intuition, that is a huge, huge thing. Always check-in with yourself. Before making any big changes in your business and in your blog. Sit back and really just reflect on it and see how it feels.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:20:50]:\
How how does it feel to you and your body? You're gonna get the right answer. Another mistake that I made was hiring costly PR and sponsorships. Investing into sponsoring, in person events wasn't really a necessity for me. I spent too much doing that. I should have gone slower. I should have just done one, tested the ROI, and maybe done another one a year later instead of trying to do a whole bunch in 1 year. For me personally, it just wasn't the right next step. And also hiring that PR team, the ROI just wasn't there.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:21:27]:\
So here is what I am doing now in 2025 to fix this mess that I created for myself since the pandemic. And, hopefully, these tips will be really helpful to you moving forward. And, hopefully, this is very practical advice that you can take and walk away from today and apply to your business. So the first step is I am using a vision board to map out my goals for the year, exactly the things that I want to do, and exactly the vision that I have for my brand. And I'm going back to my grassroots, and I'm looking at what I was thinking when I started the business. I'm starting there and focusing on what I can do moving forward that still has those same values. The hack for creating a vision board that really, really works is anything that you write on it, write it in the past tense. So let's say you want to get 10,000 page views a month with your blog in the 1st part of the year.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:22:29]:\
So instead of writing on your vision board, I want to get 10,000 page views a month. Instead of writing that, you're gonna write, I got 10,000 page views a month in February, in March, whatever it is. You're putting a date on it, and you're writing it in the past tense as if it has already happened. Write it out on a Post it or wherever you keep your vision board, put it up on your wall, or if you have a digital vision board, I use both. Read it out loud because when you're reading it out loud, you are telling your brain and your subconscious that you mean business, and you're tricking your brain into thinking it's already happened. And therefore, you are manifesting it to happen and drawing in that energy so that it really does come to life and happen. I am focusing on content creation and me being the one who creates that content in my business. I am blogging as in publishing new content every day or every second day.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:23:21]:\
I get up early and I just create new blog content. It's so funny because we all started our blogs. We all entered and became a entered the blogging industry, became a blogger, and pretty soon, a lot of us found that we no longer do blogging. Like, the thing that we do the least in our business is blogging because we're so busy with marketing, with sales, with product creation, and all of that stuff is important. But let's remember to get back to blogging and focus on blogging as the foundation of our business because that's where all the money really comes from. The more content that we're putting out means the more traffic. The more content we're putting on Pinterest, to direct traffic to that blog post, that's uplifting our brand, bringing in more traffic, more revenue. We're getting ads on our sites.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:24:07]:\
Everything comes back to the content on our blog. More content equals more money. That's just how it is, so we need to focus on blogging. And, also, it's the funnest part of the business too is being able to create content. We love that. The next most important action step that I'm taking into 2025, and I think that will be very beneficial to other creators here listening, is Pinterest. Pinterest, putting in the love and attention that Pinterest needs. Now I have been pinning about 5 to 20 pins a day for the past few months, to my home decor site, and it's now getting over 4,000,000, monthly page views, which is generating 40,000 page views just from Pinterest.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:24:47]:\
And this is to a website that I only started creating content on, in this last summer. Pinterest, it fluctuates. It definitely fluctuates seasonal, and I do have a lot of seasonal content on that, on that blog. But it's a good first start, and it is a result of showing up, creating content on Pinterest, creating new blog posts on my website, and using Pinterest to promote them. That's a big focus for me this year moving forward. I think that investing time into Pinterest a 100% is worth it. Not for every niche, but I think that if you have a niche that, is popular on Pinterest, if the things trend on Pinterest in your niche, then you really should be utilizing Pinterest for your blog. Collaboration with other creators.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:25:35]:\
Collaboration is one of the biggest things you can do for your business, and this is an example right here what you're watching. I've collaborated with Liz to get to create content for her Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Being in a virtual summit is one of my favorite ways to collaborate with other creators. So if you are a content creator, which I'm guessing you are, if you are here at this summit, think about what type of virtual events happen in your niche. Get out there, make friends, let those hosts of those summits know that you would love to be able to present something at their summit. Maybe you're gonna start your own virtual summit this year in your niche. You know, do it. Business bundles, that's another way when you can collaborate with a group of other creators in your niche.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:26:19]:\
That's always a great focus for growing your business organically. The next thing that I am focusing on is simplifying what it means to be a creator, what it means to be a CEO. I have embraced my own style of being a CEO, and I have learned through my own mistakes over the past few years that I don't want to lead a huge team. I don't wanna have a massive global company with 1,000 and 1,000 of employees. I actually really love being a solopreneur or a semi solopreneur with a very small team. That is where I am fueled the best. I'm the happiest. I work the best.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:26:59]:\
It just feels right for me. So embracing that that is okay and not only okay, but wonderful to just be a small creator and a small business owner. I am shedding the identity of what I thought being a CEO was supposed to look like and be like, and I've come to accept that. I've come to the realization that not only is it okay to scale back, but it's actually what I need in order to be happy as an entrepreneur. Scaling back has been a very good thing for me. I don't like managing a team of multiple people. I don't like having tons of people in my head telling me different things, different ways to do business. I actually really love doing things my way.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:27:50]:\
I thrive, quiet reflection time. I really just came to that realization that operating that heart centered business that serves my community is the most important thing, and it's what drives the revenue in the business and what keeps the business going. And being okay with slow growth. Slow but steady growth is fantastic. Who are these people that are telling us we need to scale up super fast and hit 1,000,000 and 1,000,000 of dollars in revenue if it doesn't feel right to us. And this is the probably the biggest takeaway of this presentation is listening to your own intuition, letting your intuition guide you in your business. That is going to be the strongest asset in your business, and that is how you're you are going to be successful is listening to your heart. What does it want you to do? What is the next step? You already know.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:28:48]:\
You just have to listen to yourself. So building an intuition led business and listening to your gut, you will be successful. And by no means do I mean don't listen to other people. Always consider other perspectives. Be a sponge in the online world. Listen to podcasts, read books, educate yourself, hear what other people have gone through, and especially being a part of a virtual summit like this. Watch every single summit presentation here. Liz curates the best people in the industry at all different types of, niches, different stages in their business.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:29:30]:\
They've got marketing pros, blogging pros, digital product creator pros. Watch everything. Watch the replays. Make time to literally sit down and watch everything and listen because every little bit of information is coming into your subconscious, and it's teaching you. You're educating yourself. But really think about what that information feels like and know that what works for one person doesn't mean it's gonna work for everyone. Being able to listen to all of these different people give their guidance, their ideas, and their advice is a wonderful piece of information. It's worth its weight in gold.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:30:06]:\
Take it all in, but then reflect on everything before making any decisions to see what feels right for you. And that is my key message of this presentation is to listen to your intuition, scale slowly, and let go of the pressure to grow your business faster than what feels right. So we have some bonuses and resources to share with you now, and I wanna say thank you so much for sticking around and watching this presentation.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.430] - Clarissa\
Hello and welcome to this session on how knowing all of the numbers in your business can actually help you grow your business. We're going to dive into what these numbers mean and how it's would actually helps you continue to grow your business. So, let's get started with who am I? I am an accountant. I started studying accounting when I was in 10th grade in high school.\
\
[00:00:39.440] - Clarissa\
I just fell in love with accounting. I've always been a numbers person. I mean I say the spreadsheets are one of my love languages. I just love spreadsheets. I have spreadsheets for everything.\
\
[00:00:53.730] - Clarissa\
I also spent six years as a government tax auditor. While I was in college, I really thought that being a government auditor was something I really wanted to do. Then I got the job. I ended up hating the job because I hate how the government treats small businesses.\
\
[00:01:11.370] - Clarissa\
I was tasked with having to go into a small business, audit this business, and purposely find the mistakes that these business owners were making in their business. And then I had to assess fines and fees to all of these business owners that I was auditing for all these mistakes that I was finding. And I didn't exactly enjoy it because I would much rather be teaching small business owners how to do it correctly, which is what I do now in my business, nerdy number lovers. I teach you guys how to do it correctly, and I also help you do it correctly.\
\
[00:01:50.190] - Clarissa\
So, like I said, spreadsheets are one of my love languages. I have spreadsheets for everything and I even have a spreadsheet for you guys today.\
\
[00:01:59.070] - Clarissa\
So, let's talk a little bit about who you are. So, I know that you are a passionate business owner and you absolutely love what you do in your business. But you are not a fan of doing the accounting, the bookkeeping or the taxes. Little hint, almost nobody likes the taxes, even I don't. So, you're not alone in that part. But the accounting and the bookkeeping.\
\
[00:02:25.540] - Clarissa\
It's part of being a business owner. And when you have to think about dealing with the numbers in your business, it just gives you a headache and you avoid it and you procrastinate and you put it off until as long as you possibly can. Now, maybe you've worked with other accounting professionals in your business, but you've been judged for what you do in your business. You talk to accountants and other financial professionals. The discussions that you have with these people are just over your head.\
\
[00:02:55.870] - Clarissa\
You have no idea what they're saying. You don't understand what they're saying, and you might even feel like you have to go get an accounting degree. Just to be able to understand the accounting in your business. Well, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to. You can understand the accounting in your business and you really don't need to be a numbers person. Like I said, spreadsheets are my favorite thing.\
\
[00:03:27.750] - Clarissa\
I love being able to create a spreadsheet where you can literally just plug in a number and it'll give you the answer that you're looking for, and that's along the lines of what I have for you today with the spreadsheet that I'm giving you.\
\
[00:03:44.710] - Clarissa\
So, what is the most important number that you need to know in your business? Is it your total revenue, your total sales that you bring in your business? Is it your expenses, your profit, your return on investment, the number of customers you have, the number of followers that you have on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, on any of those? Is that how much tax you owe or how much you don't owe? Your email list size, the bank account balance that you have? So, what do you think is the most important number out of this list?\
\
[00:04:19.810] - Clarissa\
And in my personal opinion, the most important number that you need to know in your business is your profit, which is your revenue minus your expenses.\
\
[00:04:33.050] - Clarissa\
When you have a profit in your business, it means that your business is actually making more money than you're spending.\
\
[00:04:48.090] - Clarissa\
So, is your business actually healthy? Like I said, profit is the main indicator here, not the balance in your bank account. So many of the entrepreneurs that I have personally worked with, they go by the balance in their bank account. Is there enough money in my bank account to buy this course? Is there enough money in my bank account to join this mastermind or hire this coach or hire this assistant?\
\
[00:05:16.110] - Clarissa\
They go by the bank balance. That bank balance is not your profit. And it doesn't tell you whether you have enough money in your business to pay all of the bills that you have coming in. That's where a budget comes in is planning for those bills that are coming in on a regular basis. And like I said, the profit is your revenue, which is the total sales minus your expenses, which is the money that you pay out to run your business gives you the profit. And that profit is what tells you whether you have a healthy business or not.\
\
[00:05:56.130] - Clarissa\
Now, some of you are going to say, but I don't really want to profit because I pay taxes on the profit. If you have a $20,000 profit in your business, you're paying taxes on the $20,000. Little side note here, that profit in your business that you pay tax on is one of the biggest differences of working for yourself versus working a W two job. When you work a W two job, you're paying taxes on the total amount of money that you are paid. Whereas in your business, you get to take the total amount of money you're paid and subtract your expenses.\
\
[00:06:35.150] - Clarissa\
That's why you're only taxed on your profit, which is the revenue minus your expenses.\
\
[00:06:43.270] - Clarissa\
So, knowing if your business is actually healthy or not and having a profit will help you to figure out more ways that you can continue to bring more money in. It'll help you have more money in your business to be able to continue to grow your business because there are things that you're going to have to buy to continue to grow your business. Maybe you're going to have to hire a coach. Maybe you're going to have to buy another course that teaches you specifically what you're looking for.\
\
[00:07:15.890] - Clarissa\
Or maybe you're going to have to pay by advertising.\
\
[00:07:20.830] - Clarissa\
So you need that extra profit to be able to continue to grow. That's part of why you need a profit. But the other thing is you have to have a profit in your business to prove that you are a legitimate business. When you start your business, you have five years for your business. This is according to the IRS, for your business to be considered a business.\
\
[00:07:52.630] - Clarissa\
Three of those five years, you should have a profit in your business. If you continue to have a loss after a loss, after a loss that will usually flag an audit. And you may have expenses that are going to get denied, and then you will have to pay tax on what is being denied. Yes, I have been an auditor where I denied expenses that they were trying to claim.\
\
[00:08:25.690] - Clarissa\
Now it wasn't exactly my choice. It was what I had to do. So, it really depends like you need to have that profit in your business to continue to grow your business, to prove to the IRS that you are an actual business and you're not just bringing in some money and then spending even more money than what you're bringing in. Because that's the other thing. You don't want to be spending more money than what you are bringing in.\
\
[00:08:53.230] - Clarissa\
So, how do you find these important numbers? Like I said, it's your revenue minus your profit. So, when you do your bookkeeping. But again, this is something where most people hate doing this. They hate doing their bookkeeping.\
\
[00:09:08.770] - Clarissa\
It's something you're going to ignore and you're going to procrastinate and you're going to just put it off and put it off and put it off because it's not something you enjoy. I get that. You don't have to enjoy it. But you are a business owner, and it is one of the most important things that you need to do in your business to continue to grow your business. Because if you're not doing your bookkeeping, then you're not going to be able to find out what your actual profit is. Because your bookkeeping is taking all of the transactions that happened in your business.\
\
[00:09:45.710] - Clarissa\
So, whether it's on your credit card, whether it's on your bank account, it's taking all of those transactions, and it is categorizing them into what we call a chart of accounts, which is literally just the accounts where you have names for what they are.\
\
[00:10:03.780] - Clarissa\
So, your revenue, your specific expenses, things like office expenses, advertising, payroll, virtual assistance, accounting, legal. All of those things are just accounts that are in your chart of accounts in your bookkeeping, and you sort all of your transactions into the account for what they are. And that tells you what you are spending in each one of these accounts. And it's something that you can continue to look at and analyze. Again, a word that most people don't like.\
\
[00:10:41.940] - Clarissa\
They don't like that word analyzed, but it's part of being a business owner. And that's how you continue to grow your business because you can't just fly by the seat of your pants. You can't just go with the balance in your bank account to say, oh, I have enough money. I can invest in that course when, so you invest in a course that costs $1,000.\
\
[00:11:05.920] - Clarissa\
And then two days later you get an invoice because you completely forgot about this invoice that's for $1,500. And now you only have $200 sitting in your bank account because you just bought this $1,000 course. So, It's things to think about. It's, things that need to be done in your business, whether you like it or not. And the other thing is, if you really, really don't like it, you cannot stand doing it.\
\
[00:11:34.390] - Clarissa\
You can hire a bookkeeper. You can hire an accountant to help you do all of this analysis to help you do the bookkeeping and provide you with this analysis once they do your bookkeeping. Because this analysis is what tells you what your percentages are. Are you spending more money in certain accounts? Are you spending more money on courses and continuing education versus buying books and books and books or buying software? Are you buying all kinds of different software because you're like, oh, that person is using Click funnels.\
\
[00:12:18.130] - Clarissa\
I think I like Click funnels. I'm going to try Click Funnels. That person is using Deadline funnel. I'm going to try Deadline Funnel, or that person is using QuickBooks, but that person is using Zero. I'm going to try both.\
\
[00:12:32.890] - Clarissa\
So, just trying out all of these things, it adds up, especially when you try it on a trial, and then you completely forget that you have this trial and then you get billed for the full amount. But you're looking at the total balance in your bank account. You're not looking at your actual bookkeeping and seeing where you're spending your money. So, you're missing all of these transactions where money is just going out the door. And you're not even noticing that because you're not paying attention because you're ignoring the bookkeeping.\
\
[00:13:07.270] - Clarissa\
Believe me, I have seen so many people where this happens to. I have had a client who was paying for three different email providers, MailChimp, Active Campaign and A Weber. They were paying for all three of them. They weren't even using a single one of them.\
\
[00:13:27.710] - Clarissa\
It all just depends on how much you're paying attention because again, this is where analysis comes in. This is where the bookkeeping comes in. Seeing what's going in and out of your business instead of just looking at the bank account.\
\
[00:13:51.750] - Clarissa\
So, when we do our bookkeeping and we actually begin to know these numbers, how does that actually help you grow your business? So, we're going back to the analysis here. It starts with doing this analysis. So, you can create your own spreadsheet. You can find spreadsheets out there.\
\
[00:14:10.730] - Clarissa\
Some of the bookkeeping software will give you some of this information as well, where you can plug in your numbers. Look at percentages. So, a couple of percentages are going to want to look at. Are you making more money this month compared to last month?\
\
[00:14:29.680] - Clarissa\
Are you making more money this month compared to the same month last year? Are you making more money from January to June of this year as compared to January to June of last year? Or what about the full year of this year compared to the full year of last year? Did you make more money? Did you spend more money?\
\
[00:14:54.020] - Clarissa\
Did you spend more money in certain categories? Are you buying more courses, more continuing education? Are you buying things that you're not even using again, this is where getting those trials and then ending up not even using it. But completely forgetting about it and then being billed month after month for it.\
\
[00:15:20.890] - Clarissa\
Are you buying software that you're really not even using? I know most of us are guilty of this. Like you get that FOMO, and you're like, I want to try that software out, so you try it out. You're like, I'm only going to try it for a month. You end up trying it for three days, then you completely forget about it because you get so busy doing something else in your business.\
\
[00:15:43.400] - Clarissa\
So, you completely forget about that software. And then four months down the road, you've paid for the software for every single month. But you haven't used it at once. Or what about all the books that you're buying? Buying all these books, whether they're Kindle books, they're physical books, they're audible books.\
\
[00:16:02.290] - Clarissa\
You're buying all of these books. Are you actually reading them? And if you are reading them, are they actually helping you in your business? These are all things that you need to think about and look at when you are doing your bookkeeping, when you are going through your expenses. These are all things that you can think about.\
\
[00:16:26.080] - Clarissa\
So, here's the thing, bookkeeping helps you see the past, so you can see what has happened in the past. But you take those numbers from the past for what you have done, and it helps you to plan the future. So, what I mean by this? So, on a regular basis, you bring in $1,000 a month in your business.\
\
[00:16:52.120] - Clarissa\
Okay. You already know that you are regularly bringing in $1,000 in your business, and then you are spending $250 in your business and this $250 goes to your email provider. It goes to your website hosting and it goes to let's go with Canva. So, you pay for Canva to put things out to create your images for your business. Everything else that you use in your business currently is free. But you're paying for your email provider.\
\
[00:17:30.910] - Clarissa\
You're paying for website hosting and you're paying for Canva. That total is about $250 a month. You're bringing in $1,000. So, you have $750 in profit right there. That's what you did last month.\
\
[00:17:48.500] - Clarissa\
So, you can take those numbers and you can start to plan for the future. So, you know that you have that $250 that you're paying every month for your email provider, for your website hosting, and for Canva. Okay, now maybe you need to start paying yourself a salary. How much do you need to pay yourself? You can add that in to those expenses.\
\
[00:18:15.910] - Clarissa\
Is it going to be more than $750? So, you have to start bringing in more than $1,000. You have to start putting more things out there to sell to bring more money in.\
\
[00:18:29.810] - Clarissa\
What about when you put more stuff out there? Is your email that's going to grow so that now you have to pay more money for your email list provider.\
\
[00:18:40.590] - Clarissa\
Or maybe you're going to there's this course that's coming out that will help you grow your email list. And you really, really want this course. Put that in your plans for expenses. So, you have the money to buy this course. Same thing with planning for taxes.\
\
[00:19:04.650] - Clarissa\
Like I said, you pay tax on the profit. So, in this case, our profit is $750. That is what you will be paying tax on. When it comes to filing your tax return, yes, there's other things that go into that. We are not going to talk about that to help you lower that profit.\
\
[00:19:23.850] - Clarissa\
But when you don't want to calculate those in when you are calculating your savings for taxes. So that way you have extra money saved for tax purposes before you even have to pay the tax bill. It helps reduce that stress.\
\
[00:19:45.810] - Clarissa\
So, knowing these numbers helps you plan out what you can do in the future. You can run all kinds of different scenarios to plan these numbers out. And like I said, I have a free gift for you today, and it actually helps you plan all of this stuff. The gift I have for you is the CFO starter kit. So, what is included in the starter kit is a budget calculator.\
\
[00:20:14.830] - Clarissa\
Paying yourself calculator, a revenue goal calculator, simple service pricing calculator, a cash flow forecast planner, a compliance checklist. And there's probably a few other things that are in there that will really help you with your business. These things help you continue to grow your business. So, this budget calculator, that's what I'm explaining for. It's going to help you figure out how much money you're spending in your business, how much money you need to put aside to plan your business.\
\
[00:20:55.110] - Clarissa\
The revenue goal calculator will help you figure out how much revenue you need to bring in. Same with paying yourself. How much money do you need to pay yourself in order to meet your own personal goals? And then take that money that you're paying yourself and add that into your revenue goal as well as the expenses that you're paying in your business. And this all runs together, and you guys can get the spreadsheet for free.\
\
[00:21:27.570] - Clarissa\
It's called the CFO Starter Kit. I have created all of these spreadsheets for you. Most of them are literally just plug and play. You plug in your information where you need to, and it will spit out the numbers that you may or may not want to see. So, it all depends whether you want to see this number or not, but it helps you make sure that you're on the right track in your business and so that you're really doing what you should be doing in your business and looking at the right numbers.\
\
[00:22:07.150] - Clarissa\
So, my question for you today, what number are you going to make? It your mission to start knowing regularly in your business? Because right now, if I'm guessing correctly and I know you just like most of the other entrepreneurs that I have worked with that I have talked to, the number that you already know, even without having to do any type of calculation. You already know how much money you made in your business this month. You know how many sales you made this month.\
\
[00:22:43.620] - Clarissa\
You already know that. So, what number are you going to start knowing on a regular basis? Are you going to start paying more attention to that profit like you really should be having a healthy profit in your business? Are you going to start paying more attention to the expenses in your business? I wanna know what number are you going to make?\
\
[00:23:11.280] - Clarissa\
It your mission to start knowing regularly.\

Hello, and I am excited to be presenting this masterclass, "Understanding the Financial Gibberish in Your Business."\
\
[00:00:24.080] - Clarissa\
A little bit about me and my business. I've been an accountant for over 15 years. Six of those 15 years were actually spent as a government tax auditor. But I have actually been full-time in my business since 2020 because this is what I love doing. I would prefer to be able to help you before an audit comes, because you can be prepared for an audit and an audit can actually be very simple. I've done over 150 audits when I was a tax auditor, and only two of them were very simple and easy because they were technically prepared ahead of time. I do the complete opposite of what I used to do as an auditor in my business to help you manage your finances correctly.\
\
[00:01:12.190] - Clarissa\
My business is "Nerdy Number Lovers," and we serve small business owners, mainly based online, so that you can either do your bookkeeping yourself or we can do it for you. My mission has always been to make the accounting and the bookkeeping as easy as possible for small business owners. I explain everything in plain English so that you do not need an accounting degree to be able to understand what is going on in your business.\
\
[00:01:50.040] - Clarissa\
Because as a business owner, you should be able to look at all of the numbers on your financial statements and be able to understand what is going on in your business, and not just have to look at your bank balance to know if you have enough money or not.\
\
[00:02:07.330] - Clarissa\
Today, we are going to be discussing a couple of different things. Actually, this page was not updated. We are going to be discussing your financial statements and your business. We're going to be discussing bookkeepers, accountants, and CFOs. We want to know \'97you should be figuring out what you need to be looking at in your financial statements, know how to prepare your financial statements, know how to hire an accountant, a bookkeeper, and a CFO, if you happen to need them, what questions you should be asking them when you hire them, and what questions you should be asking when you're working with them.\
\
[00:02:49.780] - Clarissa\
Let's get started. A Financial Statement is just the records that convey the business activities and the financial performance of your business. The Balance Sheet shows what the business owns, what the business owes, and what has been contributed by the owners and investors of that business.\
\
[00:03:13.570] - Clarissa\
The Profit and Loss statement shows the financial position of the company during a particular period in time. In other words, it shows how much money came in through revenue, which is your sales, and how much money went out to keep the business running, which is your expenses.\
\
[00:03:33.520] - Clarissa\
And the Statement of Cash Flows, which I personally hate the Statement of Cash Flows, I do not use it with any of my clients, but it's one of the main financial statements. It is the statement that measures how well a company generates cash to pay its debts, fund its operating needs, and investments. Another reason why I do not like the Statement of Cash Flows and do not use it, is because the majority of my clients and the businesses that I work with are cash-based businesses. Cash basis versus accrual basis is, in simple terms, how you recognize transactions in your business. 90% of the businesses that I work with are cash-basis businesses, which means you recognize a transaction when cash is actually exchanged.\
\
[00:04:27.030] - Clarissa\
And what that means is when you make a sale, and you receive the cash, that cash is exchanged. If you make a sale and the buyer is using a payment plan, so for example, the cost of the product is $3,000 and they're paying $1,000 a month for three months. So, on month one, you receive $1,000. That $1,000 is your sale because you are cash basis. Now, if you were accrual basis, you would recognize $3,000 of cash sales on month one, and then the money that is received on month two and month three would just reduce your liability account on your balance sheet. This can get confusing, and I don't want to confuse it too much because the majority of you watching this are going to be a cash-basis business. Like I said, 90% of the clients that I work with are cash-basis businesses, and that is just where we are. When cash is actually exchanged, that is when you recognize the transaction.\
\
[00:05:44.620] - Clarissa\
So a statement of cash flows wouldn't affect us because cash is what's flowing in and out. So all you have to do is look at your profit and loss statement, and that'll show you the cash flowing in and out of your business.\
\
[00:06:01.800] - Clarissa\
So a Balance Sheet. I literally just pulled this example from a Google search because I can't just pull a balance sheet from my clients and reveal numbers. It's against my policies. It's against confidentiality policies.\
\
[00:06:18.990] - Clarissa\
A Balance Sheet will show your assets, your liabilities, and your owner's equity on a single statement. So your assets are what your business owns. Your liabilities are what your business owes to someone. And the owner's equity, shareholder's equity, which is what it shows on this statement, are what the owners have put into the business. Whether you put it in when you're starting, whether you put it in as you go along, that's just how it works. The total of all of the assets, so if you look at this, the assets is this whole first column, must equal the total of the liabilities plus the equity. You see this $472,100, $472,100. If these don't balance, then something is off, and usually, it means that you're missing transactions. So, just wanted to point that out. Most of the time, if you are using software, these will always equal. If you have to prepare this yourself on a spreadsheet then you'll have to force them to balance usually, unless you literally have all of the information.\
\
[00:07:46.910] - Clarissa\
The Income statement, this is what most people refer to when they are looking at a financial statement. They're only really looking at their income statement. They're looking at the total money coming in, which is your sales, and then you have these expenses. Most of you watching this wouldn't have your expenses separated out like this. You would literally have them all under operating expenses. This is just going to show how your money moves, going in and out of your business.\
\
[00:08:25.270] - Clarissa\
One big thing about the profit and loss statement is that you want it to have these account names so that you understand what is in that account when you just look at this statement, without having to drill down further and look at the actual transactions that are going through.\
\
[00:08:47.970] - Clarissa\
For advertising costs, an example is one of the big things that I do, is we will actually have sub-accounts under this advertising for say, Facebook ads, for Google ads, for TikTok ads, so that we're splitting them all up so that you can see how much is going to each one of those specifically. We can have when you hire contractors, you can have a marketing contractor account, you can have your VA as its own account, things like that, so that when you look at this statement, you know what is included in those transactions.\
\
[00:09:28.200] - Clarissa\
Then the Statement of Cash Flows, like I said, if you're a cash-basis business, this isn't going to apply at all. I'm just showing you an example. It shows how cash flows through your business, but it only applies to accrual-based businesses. And the problem with a statement of cash flows is you are actually adding back in things where money went out, and you are subtracting where money came in. So a statement of cash flows can be confusing. Another reason why I don't use it, and it's not used for cash-based businesses.\
\
[00:10:21.270] - Clarissa\
How are financial statements prepared? Step one, you have to do your bookkeeping. If your bookkeeping is not done, you cannot prepare your financial statements. So one of the most important financial aspects of your business is doing your bookkeeping. When that is done and all of your purchases, your sales, are sorted into the correct categories, then you can move on to reconciliations. Your reconciliation literally just makes sure that every transaction that went through your bank account and your credit card, is included in the right categories. So, it makes sure that you're not duplicating transactions, and it makes sure that you're not missing transactions that actually did happen.\
\
[00:11:09.230] - Clarissa\
Because if you're using software, sometimes that happens where it won't pull in all of your transactions. So you have to do a reconciliation, which is just checking boxes to make sure that you have all the right numbers. And then you can prepare your financial statements so that you can actually review them.\
\
[00:11:31.380] - Clarissa\
The question is, do you want software or do you want to use a spreadsheet? It honestly depends on which is easier for you and whether you are at a place in your business where you are trying to cut your expenses right now. So if you're trying to cut them, then I would suggest using a spreadsheet. But if you have the funds to pay for software, but also keep in mind that if you cancel the software, then you're missing a lot of your bookkeeping that's going to go on. So you would need to be able to find a way to pull your reports from that software and still be able to do your bookkeeping on a regular basis. On a spreadsheet can be much more time-consuming than doing it in the software. But another thing is the software has always been created for accountants. There is a learning curve when you start using it.\
\
[00:12:34.970] - Clarissa\
Let's move on to the three main financial professionals that you would hire in your business. The first one is a bookkeeper. They handle your lower-level accounting tasks to help keep your business compliant and on track for financial success. You may or may not hire a bookkeeper. If you do not hire one that means you as the business owner, are the bookkeeper, and you have to make sure that your bookkeeping itself is done.\
\
[00:13:05.460] - Clarissa\
The second one is an accountant, and they will normally file your tax returns. They help answer questions about tax regulations and keeping your business compliant with the tax regulations and laws, because there are certain ones that apply to certain industries, and certain types of taxes that you may or may not be familiar with, but now that you own a business, you need to be. An accountant is someone that you should hire whether you want to or not because when you own a business, it can get very complicated to start filing your own tax returns.\
\
[00:13:54.880] - Clarissa\
And then the final one is a CFO, which is a high-level financial professional who can actually help your business achieve higher financial goals, and help you see how your progress is coming along in your business. They can also run your entire accounting department, work with outside accountants, they can oversee your bookkeeper and that stuff. Usually, with the type of businesses that my clients run, this is a fractional CFO. It can be something that you might want, but we'll get into that a little later.\
\
[00:14:34.200] - Clarissa\
So what is a Bookkeeper? A bookkeeper is a financial professional who helps business owners with a multitude of different financial aspects of their business that includes, but is not limited to, categorizing the transactions on the financial state to create the financial statements. They can assist with paying bills, signing invoices, running payroll, doing sales tax. They can help you with keeping your business run smoothly on the financial side. This depends on the type of bookkeeper that you do hire.\
\
[00:15:13.060] - Clarissa\
As we get into these questions and what you need to look for, you can understand a little bit more about bookkeepers, because some are going to be super low-level, where they literally only do categorizing of the transactions, and some can do a little bit more where they can assist you with paying bills, sending invoices, doing payroll, helping with your sales tax. But at the same time, they need to have an accounting education so that they can help you with this stuff.\
\
[00:15:47.460] - Clarissa\
When do you need to hire a bookkeeper? There are three main times when you would need to hire a bookkeeper. One, when you start your business. Two, when you end up doing your bookkeeping yourself, and then it just gets to a point where you can't keep up with it because there's so much to do in your business, and bookkeeping just ends up taking a lot of time. Then you want to hire someone so that your bookkeeping is still done regularly. Then number three, when you really just don't want to do it because, like I said, your bookkeeping needs to be done on a regular basis, and if it's not, then you don't know your numbers. You don't know the financial position of your business.\
\
[00:16:39.070] - Clarissa\
When not to hire a bookkeeper? When you need your taxes prepared and you only need your taxes prepared. I end up getting clients in January and in September because they need their bookkeeping done just to be able to file their taxes. They don't care about looking at their numbers throughout the year, but they do need it done to be able to give it to their accountant. When you do this, you will usually be paying higher rates because you basically need a rush job done.\
\
[00:17:18.240] - Clarissa\
Bookkeeping is not a job that can be done rushed because then somebody's going to be missing something. It's not fun when you miss something. I can tell you this from the audit side, too. If you're missing something, it's not fun. You need to make sure that everything is correct the way that it should be. And when you wait and hire your bookkeeper when it's time for taxes, you're making them rush.\
\
[00:17:51.330] - Clarissa\
So, what questions should you be asking when you're hiring a bookkeeper? I honestly think this is one of the most important questions. "What is your education and training with bookkeeping? And then how long have you been doing bookkeeping? How did you get started with bookkeeping? What systems do you use?" Because there are some where they're going to use a system that you aren't familiar with or that your business isn't using. You want to make sure that you're using the same systems.\
\
[00:18:24.560] - Clarissa\
"How do you keep track of your client work? Basically, what is their CRM? "What is your process for sending month-end reports?" I know some that they send their month-end reports around the 15th to the 20th of the following month. My personal business policy is you get it by the fifth business day of the next month. Usually, the latest would be the seventh or the eighth of the month, depending on when holidays fall and that type of thing.\
\
[00:18:58.920] - Clarissa\
"Do you customize my reports and categories to what I would like them to be?" You're going to find some bookkeepers that do not do this. And if we go back to the profit and loss statement, like I said, you want that to be so that you know what you're looking at when you read your financial statement. If it's not, then you're just going to be confused and you're not going to be able to really use the financial statements to help your own business the right way.\
\
[00:19:33.030] - Clarissa\
And then, "What is your experience with a business like mine?" This is another important question. They need to be able to understand your business and not just take all different kinds of businesses.\
\
[00:19:50.610] - Clarissa\
Questions to ask when you're working with a bookkeeper. You've already hired one, and you should be asking them questions on a regular basis so that you can understand what's going on. You always want to ask when you don't understand why something shows on your financial reports a certain way.\
\
[00:20:09.560] - Clarissa\
You want to ask them to create the financial report so that you can understand it. This goes back to creating those specific categories so that you understand it and you can see where your money is going.\
\
[00:20:22.950] - Clarissa\
You want to ask the bookkeeper if they see that you have multiple of the same transactions going through. This is something that I normally point out to my clients before they even ask me.\
\
[00:20:36.340] - Clarissa\
You want to ask how you can work together to either save more money in your business or make more money. And again, this goes back to the bookkeeper that you hire, some may not be able to answer these questions for helping you save more money or make more money in your business. They just might not have the education. They might not have the ability to be able to see this stuff. That depends on the bookkeeper you hire.\
\
[00:21:05.760] - Clarissa\
Then you want to work with your bookkeeper to help keep your business on the road to financial success. This can include making sure that everything's done on a timely basis, making sure your bookkeeper has access to everything that they need, and then having communication.\
\
[00:21:29.440] - Clarissa\
Questions your bookkeeper should be asking you. A lot of clients that have come to me, they come with their financial statements showing these following accounts: the Ask My Accountant, Uncategorized Expense, Uncategorized Revenue, and Uncategorized Asset. You should never see those on your financial statements when you're looking at them, because it means that your bookkeeper did not ask questions about what transactions are, to get more information. Your bookkeeper should always be asking you if they really do not know, what a certain transaction is so it can be categorized correctly. You should never see these four accounts on your financial statements.\
\
[00:22:17.010] - Clarissa\
They should ask you when they see double transactions, if they're actually legitimate, and when they see transactions that are odd and could possibly be fraud. This part about fraud though, they would have to be working with you for a while to understand what's actually happening in your business to be able to know if something really is odd or not. But this is something that you yourself, as the business owner, could be doing to make sure that you understand what is going on.\
\
[00:22:49.400] - Clarissa\
So where do you find a bookkeeper? You can ask fellow business owners who they work with. You can do a Google search and try to find someone who has a website. You can try Upwork. I would say to be cautious though, because you're going to find a lot of bookkeepers in a third-world country that are going to charge you super-low rates. And it usually means they don't completely understand the bookkeeping. I'm not saying that all of them don't understand it. I'm just saying I've done a lot of cleanup jobs where they have used bookkeepers with really low rates. And there were so many of those: Ask my Accountant, Uncategorized Expense, Uncategorized Revenue, Uncategorized Asset. I highly recommend that you find someone who is located in the same country as you. That way there is more understanding of the same tax laws at least.\
\
[00:23:57.620] - Clarissa\
Because while bookkeeping is the same country to country, you're still going to run into issues with possibly them not covering the right information. So be careful when you're looking for a bookkeeper, with hiring them in the same country at least. You may end up going through a couple of bookkeepers.\
\
[00:24:26.090] - Clarissa\
Okay, so what do you usually need to give your bookkeeper when you're hiring them? View-only access to your bank account. View-only access to your merchant account, Stripe, Square, PayPal, those type of things. Access to your bookkeeping software. Access to a folder with your business purchase receipts and invoices. Anything else that revolves around the finances of your business. Now, this comes with a little bit of a warning here because I understand that for some of you, this is going to be a security concern by having to give this information to them. I personally have never had a client say, "No, I'm not giving you that," because it makes it so much easier when I have this access to be able to just go in and pull the reports.\
\
[00:25:19.180] - Clarissa\
Otherwise, you have to go in and pull all of these financial statements from your accounts and get them to your bookkeeper so that they can do the reconciliations. And that means that you're holding up the entire process. And when I say you can do view-only access to all of these accounts, I have view-only access to over 50 bank accounts, to multiple different Stripe, Square, and PayPal accounts. And this is because I have that many clients that I just need to be able to go in and pull this information. When you do view-only access, they cannot do anything in your account except for pull statements and see exactly what is there.\
\
[00:26:09.520] - Clarissa\
The other thing is you want to make sure that they get their own login information. And this way you are able to see exactly what they are doing in your account when they have their own login, versus using yours. Please do not just give them your username and password, create their own, because if you give them your username and password, whenever they go into your account, it looks like you were doing something. So, if they were to transfer money somewhere, it looks like you did it. So, if it ends up being a fraudulent transfer of money, you technically did it. So, you have no way of proving that it wasn't you because you're logged in as you.\
\
[00:27:05.690] - Clarissa\
The next professional is an Accountant. They will help you with filing tax returns. They can help you with making sure that you're following the right tax laws and regulations for your business. Not all accountants are CPAs, and they do not need to be a CPA to assist you in your business. All CPAs are accountants because you have to have an accounting education to be able to be a CPA.\
\
[00:27:50.420] - Clarissa\
When do you need to hire an accountant? When you start your business, you should have an accountant with your business from the very beginning, so that they understand your business and that they can answer questions for you.\
\
[00:28:05.500] - Clarissa\
When not to hire an accountant? When you need your taxes prepared. And do not try to hire an accountant if your bookkeeping is not done, because then this accountant is either going to charge you an awful lot of money or they're going to turn you away. I've had clients come to me and say, "My accountant told me I do not want your boxes of receipts." Most accountants, when they're preparing their taxes, they want your financial statements. That's it. They don't care about the rest. Normally, they need your financial statements and the last month of the year for your bank statements. That's it. That's all they need.\
\
[00:28:58.080] - Clarissa\
Many business owners will start their business and think that they can handle filing their own tax return on their own, but they quickly learn that a business tax return is a little bit more involved than just doing a W-2. That is why it is so important to find an accountant when you start your business and really get it in there.\
\

If you walk away from this training learning anything, you should have an accountant that you can easily turn to, and you should probably hire a bookkeeper. With this presentation, you can also get my hiring guide to hire a bookkeeper, a accountant, and a CFO for your business. It's going to include all of the questions that you would ask them when hiring them, you would ask them when working with them.\
\
[00:30:11.840] - Clarissa\
The last professional is a CFO. This is a high-level financial professional that can help you with preparing budgets and forecasts, analyzing where your business has been successful, and how to keep that growth going, and assisting with other financial professionals in your business, such as helping you with hiring an accountant, helping you with hiring a bookkeeper. The thing with the CFO is that you really don't want to hire a CFO until your business is crossing the $500,000 a year mark. At least this is my opinion. You're going to see other people that have a different opinion where you should hire a CFO first and then go to the other financial professionals. I think you should hire a bookkeeper and accountant first, and then once you cross $500,000 a year, then you can go with the CFO and they can help you with this stuff, because a CFO is going to need certain information already to be able to help you with your business.\
\
[00:31:28.100] - Clarissa\
They're not going to be able to help you so much from the very beginning with growing this stuff if you don't have anything in place. Unlike having a bookkeeper and an accountant, you don't actually need to have a CFO in your business to help keep your business on track financially. A CFO is a part of your business financial team that can help your business grow even more. So when you're really looking to scale, that would be a time to bring in a CFO because they can help you create more reports, to create a forecast, to see if you need to hire certain people in your business to help your business grow even more. This is what I mean by you should cross $500,000 a year before you're ready to hire a CFO.\
\
[00:32:28.210] - Clarissa\
I know I covered a lot of information in this presentation, so you can get my free "Financial Professional Hiring Guide'" with this presentation. Like I said, I go over a lot of the questions that you should be asking when you're hiring, when you are working with, and when you should be hiring your financial professionals, your bookkeeper, your CFO, and your accountant.\
\
[00:33:06.600] - Clarissa\
This guide goes a lot more in-depth into things that I couldn't discuss because I was limited on time in this presentation. You can get that guide at nerdynumberlovers.com/hiringguide.\
\
[00:33:26.080] - Clarissa\
I hope you enjoyed this presentation. You got a lot of information. I look forward to helping you even more in your business with the accounting and the financial stuff. Have a good one.\

[00:00:09.980] - Cynthia Jones, royaltymindsetcoach.com\
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining me. Welcome to the Bloggers Summit. I know you're having a wonderful time. I know you're learning a lot. I know that it's been very inspirational. It's very inspirational and motivational for you. My name is Cynthia. And the topic that I'm going to be speaking on today is developing your mindset for success.\
\
[00:00:36.800] - Cynthia\
In anything that we're doing. The first person we have to have on board is ourselves. We have to be able to recognize things that help us and things that actually don't help us. And where it all starts is in the mind. So that's what I'm going to be talking about today on how to develop that mindset for success on how you can build the life and dreams that you are desiring. Yes, it is possible.\
\
[00:01:06.080] - Cynthia\
So, I know you might be thinking, you know, how do I do it? Where do I start? What is going on? A lot of times we go through life- maybe you were in corporate and after some time you realized that you weren't being fulfilled there. You had a bigger calling, that you wanted to serve people, that you wanted to be your own boss. And you start out and then life happens. Maybe you lose part of your confidence and you just start to wonder, what am I doing? Is this for me? And so that's the part where I come in. I help to encourage you that if you were able to think about it, if you created it in your head, then yes, you can create it in reality as well. And it all starts with just one basic step. And that is envisioning that is believing what you have thought about, that it is going to come true. And believe me, without wavering, believe me, knowing that this is the truth, this is what I'm going to do. And then you take those steps and you set out to do it.\
\
[00:02:15.020] - Cynthia\
A little bit. Again, my name is Cynthia Jones. A little bit about me. I am a business and mindset coach. How I started actually is, you know, like everyone else, we all start from somewhere. I was in cybersecurity. I was a cybersecurity analyst. I was in the IT field for over ten years. And what happened is that when I started, I thought, "I'm going to do cyber security." Actually no. I said, "I'm going to do IT" because back then it was just called information technology. I didn't have anything around me showing me IT. I didn't know anyone in IT. But I had this dream that I would become IT professional. I had created in my mind that it would be better for me and my family if I did IT. So, yeah. So I just started with that dream in my head and I just dug into it and I would not let anything stop me.\
\
[00:03:17.210] - Cynthia\
So, when I started, I wanted to be a system administrator. I thought this would be great if I could do this, if I could accomplish this goal. And I started out and I realized that system administrator was going to be very difficult for me as a woman, as a you know, as you can see, a colored woman. And I thought, what else could I do? And I back then was called information assurance. I said, "Well, what about this new field called Information Assurance. Surely I can do that. And I started and I dug in. I got a master's, actually two masters, and I became this wonderful cybersecurity professional.\
\
[00:03:58.790] - Cynthia\
And along the way, after I had accomplished all these great goals, I realized that that was not my true calling, that something else was my true calling, which is serving people, which is helping other entrepreneurial women grow into the dreams and desires that they have. Some desires might be blogging, for others it might be coaching. It could be an array of things. But the one underlying theme that everyone shares is that you have a story, you have a message that you are ready to give to the world. And I believe that we all have that. We all have that message, that unique voice inside of us that the world is waiting to hear. It doesn't matter if there is one thousand bloggers or one thousand coaches. What is important is that your take, your voice is heard because there's an audience waiting for you.\
\
[00:04:59.480] - Cynthia\
So, that's what I do. I help women mostly achieve these really, really big goals.\
\
[00:05:10.250] - Cynthia\
So, how do I do this process? Well, the way that I have developed my process is actually I have to develop it first with myself is that you create the vision, then you begin to set effective goals and then you begin, then that will lead you to the steps to design the life that you have been dreaming of. And everyone is different. Some inspire to be a teacher, some inspire to be an entrepreneur. Some inspired to be a stay-at-home-mom. You know, some inspire to be just an online business. So, it doesn't matter what the inspiration is, but what matters is that you're taking steps to fulfill it because it's a long is that desire is not being fulfilled, you will always feel like something is missing.\
\
[00:06:00.560] - Cynthia\
So, what is the vision? How do you develop this vision is really, really important, because if you don't have the vision right, then you're not going to be able to navigate into the path that you want to go.\
\
[00:06:16.100] - Cynthia\
So a couple of things that I would like to go over is here's what you need to know. What we have been taught about vision, and it's closely related to dreaming is really false because I'm sure you heard, you know, you can't be a dreamer. You can't sit around and dream all day. Nothing's going to happen if you're dreaming. That's actually false. We do need to dream. We do need to dig inside of what we have to give, because what I have to give and what you have to give is uniquely different.\
\
[00:06:46.730] - Cynthia\
So, it's not the same because I'm Cynthia and you're Stephanie or Marie or, you know, whatever your name is, you are you and so is uniquely different. Different. It may look like the same, but it's not. And it's the best thing you can do. The best way you can grow your life is by starting with the dream.\
\
[00:07:09.230] - Cynthia\
Once we have that dream vision, we begin to create the goals to move towards that desire we are seeking to fulfill.\
\
[00:07:19.880] - Cynthia\
And again, what you are desiring is very important. It's what you are meant to do. So, don't take it lightly. Don't take it as it's something that can't be accomplished. Sometimes it's really huge. It scares you. It's okay, you can do it. We always create everything twice. We create it once in the mental, in our head, in our minds, and then we create it again in the physical. But nothing is created until we create it first in our mental. That's why vision and dreaming is so important. And the other thing that it will do is it will take you out of your comfort zone. A lot of times people are comfortable in being comfortable. And I like to say, "You need to get comfortable in being uncomfortable." That's where you're your big aspirations are. That's where your big inspirations are in that uncomfortable ability, if you know what I mean. You know, you're not going to be comfortable starting your own blog. You're not going to be comfortable starting your own coaching business. Why? Because it's something you haven't done before. It's something you don't know what it looks like. It's something that you're envisioning, but you haven't quite seen it. So, you just keep envisioning it until you see it. That's just the way it is. It's something that you're just expiring for and you're thinking, "How is it all going to work?" But trust in the process, it will work out. So, my encouragement is that whatever it is that you are desiring to do, believe that it will happen. It will happen.\
\
[00:09:06.290] - Cynthia\
As I was saying before, the art of seeing vision is the art of seeing what is invisible. We create everything twice. We do. We create everything twice. The vision is so important. The dreaming is so important because without it you can't create. You're like a ship with no destination. You know, you have to embrace those visions. You have to embrace those dreams. As big as and scary as they may seem, maybe they're not aligned with what you're doing. Maybe right now you are working a nine to five, but you're being pulled to start your own business. And you're thinking, "How do I do this?" Once you believe that it will be done? You don't have to worry about the how. You will get the inspiration and the steps and the ways to move- you will you just have to believe that it's going to happen for you.\
\
[00:10:00.790] - Cynthia\
So, I have a quick story about us. I've been listening to this gentleman, Earl Nightindale, and he gave a story of one hundred men who started out even at the age of 25. And they all believe they were going to be successful. They all started on the same playing field, per say, and by the time they were 65, only one had became rich, four had became financially independent, five were still working and fifty four were broke.\
\
[00:10:36.940] - Cynthia\
So, why was there such a large gap? Because the one that was rich and the ones, the four that were financially independent, they had captured that vision of being rich. If you are desiring to be rich first, you have to believe you have to grab a hold of that vision. I'm going to be rich. I'm going to be successful. And you don't compare your success to other people. Your success is independent of you.\
\
[00:11:09.240] - Cynthia\
How you're going to start, I keep saying blogging because we're having the Blogging Summit, but how you are going to start your blogging business is different than every other person. Yes, there are the steps that tells you, you know, get your domain, get your website, you know, put your plug in and start writing things like that. Yes. Those things are there. That's an outline. But your particular steps, you have to be able to envision how that's going to work. And then you believe in it, and then you begin to move towards those steps. Vision is very important in building your business, your life, anything is very important. Vision will take you places that you were dreaming of, truly.\
\
[00:12:00.590] - Cynthia\
The next one is a goal setting, so another thing that separated the 100 men from the rich in the financially independent other ones was goals. So, after they determined, they decided I'm going to be rich, they begin to map that out. What is the vehicle that takes you to your success? To that successful blogging that has one hundred and twenty unique views? What is the the steps or the plan that takes you there? Well, it begins with a plan and goal.\
\
[00:12:39.740] - Cynthia\
Goals. I believe that, you know, once you have those goals, first you develop the plan, then you develop the goals around the plan. So, it's the vision, the plan and the goals. And you move towards these things.\
\
[00:12:58.920] - Cynthia\
Another example is say that let's say you want to become a successful blogger or coach and you just start, you say, "Okay, I'm going to start this blogging business or I'm going to start this coaching business. Let me get going. I'm going to build a website. I'm going to start speaking on Podcast. I'm going to create a blog to go on my website. I'm going to start speaking to people about it and all these things." And you just start doing 101 things. And then a year later, you find yourself doing 101 things. Why? Because you're just like on a hamster wheel. You did not create a plan with goals.\
\
[00:13:39.150] - Cynthia\
So, the first thing that if you want to be- and a lot of times people- I'm sorry, a lot of times people think it doesn't work, but it is the step by step, the mundane things, mundane things that take you to success. That is your vehicle to success. So, we would have been better to say, "Okay, I'm going to start my website and I'm going to either you're going to start a personal website or maybe just start a blog website. But either or- I'm going to start it. And then the first thing I'm going to do is start generating traffic to that website. How do I do that? Okay, I need to I want organic traffic or am I going to use paid, what am I going to write about? How am I going to when I'm posting on social media, it would be to drive traffic to my website." And that is the first plan you start with.\
\
[00:14:31.490] - Cynthia\
Maybe your second plan is your social media. Maybe your third plan is your speaking engagements. But until you get the idea, the thing about it is that you start it with a plan. And you develop goals to move you towards the success you are looking for.\
\
[00:14:52.850] - Cynthia\
So, I think I've gone over this enough that provisions are important. They're very important and, you know, it's good to write them down. It's good to create them without boundaries. It's good to just really allow yourself to dream of the life you are desiring and how you're going to create it. Goals when you're having your goals. Don't play small. Don't hold yourself back. Really engage in what you are doing and believe, believe, believe. It doesn't matter what's happening around you, doesn't matter what things look like. Don't give up hope. Hope takes you a long way. It really does.\
\
[00:15:37.210] - Cynthia\
So, you have goals and you have visions. They do help change your life, your family, your career. So, it's very important that you hold on to those things. So, as we're coming to a close, let's think about it. It's your dream vision. Dream big, vision huge when you're doing it, don't put boundaries on yourself, don't say in the past "I wasn't successful." "How am I going to get the money,?" Let all of the constraints go and dream big. Once you have the dream, begin to develop the plan to get to the dream, which is one aspect of this dream that you're going to dig into and make it successful. Once you've done that, then how am I going to do that with goals? So, I'm going to set up goals around my vision and plan. And I ensure you, you will be very successful.\
\
[00:16:39.010] - Cynthia\
Another quick statistics on planning and goal setting. This one's was from Harvard study, and it was a single question is what was their goals in life? And have you written these goals down and created a plan to attain them? 84% had not written down their goals and 13% had and they were very successful. So, again, just imagine- just imagine what life you are desiring and then start to make the plan to achieve this life.\
\
[00:17:19.540] - Cynthia\
I know sometimes it's scary. I know sometimes it's hard. I know sometimes life gets difficult. But don't give up that dream or that plan or those goals to attain it. It may seem like it's not going to happen, but in due time it will happen if you don't lose hope and you don't lose the desire because we all move towards the things that we desire.\
\
[00:17:52.950] - Cynthia\
So, that's basically it. I hope that you enjoy the talk. I hope you enjoy the rest of the speakers that are coming. I hope that, you know, you begin to design the life you are desiring. I hope and I believe that you will create, you know, the blogging website and it will be very successful. You will put the time and effort in to make it successful. Nothing is successful with wishing and and sitting down. But things are a success because you do. And I believe that with the tips that we're giving you, the encouragement that we're giving you, you will be able to do just that.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.850] - Debbie\
Hi, everyone. I'm Debbie Gartner, and I'm here to help you monetize your way to an extra $1,000 a month or whatever your goal is. Hopefully, this methodology will help you because because as you'll see, I've had more than my fair share of targets that I needed to hit and mishaps along the way. Okay, why am I doing this? As we all know, the economy is not so hot right now, and many of us are facing extra challenges.\
\
[00:00:44.440] - Debbie\
That could simply be because our business is not doing as well as we would like, or we needed to be, or it's having some declines, my business included. It could also be because of your job or your significant other's job, or your side gig or you know, anything, any sort of challenge like that. It could also be because you have higher expenses with inflation, or it could be because you have some unexpected expenses or surprises. And as you'll hear, I've had more than my fair share of these. Or so it seems.\
\
[00:01:27.610] - Debbie\
I think we all feel this way at times. By the way, this is normal. It may not feel like it's normal, but it is normal. It's the way business goes.\
\
[00:01:40.080] - Debbie\
It goes in cycles. Life, you know, has its surprises all the time. The better you learn how to look at these as challenges that you can overcome, the stronger you will be emotionally and financially, and the better able you will be to deal with this and to shade or insulate your business, so that it can weather the storms, because the storms will happen. I've had my own small business, local business, brick and mortar store before this. And you know, there are always challenges.\
\
[00:02:23.810] - Debbie\
Businesses always change. The market always changes. It's just a part of life. Okay, so what are we going to talk about? We're going to talk about setting a goal when you need to get some more money in the door and you need to do it relatively quickly.\
\
[00:02:41.170] - Debbie\
How you can build up to that goal and really think about the building blocks, so you're not just shooting in the dark. And then we're going to discuss the main ways to monetize. We'll talk about the ones you can activate quicker and the ones that may be more sustainable as well and more cumulative over time. Okay.\
\
[00:03:03.880] - Debbie\
Who am I? I'm Debbie Gartner, obviously. And I've been blogging since 2010. I've been an entrepreneur since before that. I have been monetizing my blog since 2017.\
\
[00:03:17.890] - Debbie\
And I've had experience in both a B to B and B to C world, both in corporate and in small business. I was able to get myself out of $238,000 of bad debt. I'm not talking about the debt on my home. I'm talking about bad debt. And I was able to do it in three and a half years without any savings, without any capital fund.\
\
[00:03:50.860] - Debbie\
I had to figure it out. My specialties lie in SEO, affiliate marketing, as well as email strategy, and analytics. They have served me well over my entire career in all my jobs. I also love pets. You may hear my new kitty come out and he is very vocal but very attached already.\
\
[00:04:17.060] - Debbie\
He's been with me for a week. But I love pets, I love wordles, Sudokus, and I love learning. I have a liberal arts education and an MBA, and as you'll see, I really believe in diversification of income streams and sources of traffic. And that really helps insulate your business. I do my best to be as transparent as I can.\
\
[00:04:47.710] - Debbie\
All right. So, what is my experience with building business plans or gap plans? They are really the same thing. So, first, before I even had my own small businesses, I worked in corporate America on some very large businesses. I worked at PNG and several other places like that. So, I have experience with big budgets as well as now with small budgets.\
\
[00:05:14.450] - Debbie\
All right, so how do we go about this? The first step is to figure out your goal. If you don't have a goal, you don't even know what you're shooting for, and you need to have a plan. If you don't have a plan, you're basically lost. Hope is not a good solution.\
\
[00:05:34.810] - Debbie\
Having a plan is a very good solution, even if the plan is wrong, even if the plan is off. If your assumptions are off, that's okay. You will learn to adjust as you need and as you put better numbers in there from real world experience of doing this.\
\
[00:05:54.440] - Debbie\
But start out with some assumptions. There have been many studies that show that when you do this, even if your assumptions are wrong, overall, you end up in a much better place. And that is what I'd encourage you to do. Figure out what you really need, not what you want, but what you absolutely need as a bare minimum.\
\
[00:06:20.230] - Debbie\
If you want to have a higher plan to shoot for as well, that is totally fine. But be realistic. This talk is more for people who are already making money, not people who have never made any money online before. Because I guess I would say anyone can do this. But if you haven't made money before, it's just going to take you longer to do and your assumptions will be further off.\
\
[00:06:54.470] - Debbie\
But this is intended to help people who have made money and now had a setback and need to regain that money, or they've had a new surprise and they need to work up to that. Once you start earning money, earning more money is easier and easier. So, first figure out your goal, and then try to figure out in very broad strokes, how you will get up to that goal. We will discuss later how you drill down for each of those pieces. I will go a tad out of order here, but that's what you were trying to do.\
\
[00:07:35.880] - Debbie\
Figure out your broad stroke goals in terms of what you can do and what you feel comfortable doing and what you feel is most promising.\
\
[00:07:49.750] - Debbie\
Okay, step two. This is a part that so many people miss. I'm going to go into more detail on this, but you need to have those building blocks. So, for me, when I basically lost everything and I found myself in a huge amount of debt, I figured out how much I needed to survive. And when I say survive, I mean the bare minimum.\
\
[00:08:16.310] - Debbie\
Not to lose my house and to be able to pay for things like food and medical and stuff like that. I live in a very high cost of living area, so chances are you don't need as much to survive as I did. Plus, you may not have a huge amount of debt like I did as well. But I said, my goal is $7,000. How am I going to do it?\
\
[00:08:42.180] - Debbie\
And I chose to do three things because these were three things that I thought I could do relatively well, relatively quickly, and it would get me there. So, my first big chunk was from freelancing. And for freelancing, I did blogging for others, and I did SEO.\
\
[00:09:07.090] - Debbie\
And I was able to make $4,000 a month pretty quickly within three months. And by the way, I had no experience freelancing. So, I just want to be clear a lot of this, I had no experience, okay? I had skills, but no experience. Okay?\
\
[00:09:28.330] - Debbie\
So, anyway, I got $4,000 a month from that within three months. But it wasn't enough because I needed $7,000. And I knew that I only had three weeks of savings. So, it's not like I had a lot of cushion or savings that I could work with here, or even invest. So, I basically found a part-time job.\
\
[00:09:52.800] - Debbie\
And for this, I was doing painting estimates. And by the way, I knew next to nothing about painting. I knew, you know, home decor somewhat, I knew flooring. And I figured, well, painting is kind of similar to flooring. I could probably learn that.\
\
[00:10:10.530] - Debbie\
But I was able to make about $2000-3000 a month doing that. I was paid on commissions only, and I myself had an existing blog that I was, when I turned the ads on, I was making, let's call it around fifteen hundred dollars a month. I learned affiliate marketing pretty quickly, but my income on my blog was simply coming from ads and affiliate marketing. When I add up those numbers, I end up with seven thousand five hundred dollars to eight thousand five hundred dollars a month. You can see that that number is higher than my goal of my bare minimum of $7,000 because I needed to make sure that I paid my mortgage.\
\
[00:10:57.830] - Debbie\
I needed to make sure that I could pay for my health insurance because I had a condition. Anyway, when your income is variable, you need to understand that some months, you will make more and some, you will make less. And there is no guarantee on any of this. So, when that happens, you need to build in a safety cushion and basically shoot for a higher goal. So that when you have those months where you are below the goal, you can make it through. Okay.\
\
[00:11:41.890] - Debbie\
Other months will help cover you and you keep that in your little, you know, one month of savings or whatever it is. But that's what I did. Okay, now before I forget, this is really important. If you need to get money in the door quickly, for whatever reason, you have bills to pay. You don't have any income coming in, 99.9% of the time, the fastest way to get money in the door is to do some sort of services or active income.\
\
[00:12:18.020] - Debbie\
It's not going to be through traditional blogging or ad revenue, not affiliate marketing, not products, not sponsored posts. These are all great ways to make money, but they all take time to build and they all have time delays in terms of when you get paid. Often you don't get paid for an extra two to three months. And most of us don't have lots of savings stocked away.\
\
[00:12:49.220] - Debbie\
I know I didn't. So, doing some sort of service where you get paid, you're basically trading time for money, your skills, your work. I don't care if it's skilled or unskilled, but do something that helps other people and that you can get paid for. It could be as simple as, you know, babysitting or doing freelance blogging like I did. There are many different things, but do something like that.\
\
[00:13:25.570] - Debbie\
So, you're focusing on active income. You need to do something and you will get paid right away for doing it. As many of you know, I am a big fan of passive income and that is what I do and where I do currently make the majority of my income. And it was my long term goal to go there. But it's not something I could rely on when I needed money right away because it takes time to build.\
\
[00:13:57.720] - Debbie\
So, I basically did both in parallel. And if you need to get money in quickly, I'd recommend the same for you. All right, so what can you do that's skilled or unskilled? Think about every single job, every single class you've taken in school, everything you've learned. Think about everything that your friends come to you for.\
\
[00:14:19.680] - Debbie\
What are you good at? It could be some random thing like picking out outfits for someone, or you know, taking care of pets, or helping people pick out computers, whatever the heck it is. Okay, it could be freelancing, which is a very broad category, but think about all the things you can do for other bloggers or other businesses. It could be writing, blogging, IT, web design, graphics, whatever. What are you good at and/or what can you do easily that you can monetize?\
\
[00:14:55.160] - Debbie\
It could be a part time job like I did. I did a painting, part time job could be house sitting, pet sitting, buying groceries for others. Don't worry about this being a glorious job. This is about getting money in the door and surviving. Later, you can evolve your skills and what you do, but make sure you are in the position to be able to do that by having money and not making the situation worse.\
\
[00:15:29.210] - Debbie\
You can be a virtual assistant. You can help other bloggers or other businesses. By the way, often other businesses or local businesses will pay you more than a blogger will. So that is the market that I went after because they have more money. Okay?\
\
[00:15:48.660] - Debbie\
So, just want to throw that out there. You can do coaching, you can do consulting. It could be on anything. Like for me, I did design consultations, paint consultations. I did flooring consultations.\
\
[00:16:03.610] - Debbie\
If you are a nutritionist, you can help people with that, or dieting, or exercising, just whatever you're good at, organizing, staging, anything that you are good at. The possibilities are endless. You may not realize what they all are now.\
\
[00:16:24.520] - Debbie\
You may realize some in three months from now, but just get going on something. The other ideas will come to you when you become less stressed about money.\
\
[00:16:37.390] - Debbie\
Okay? How did I do it? And by the way, like I said, I had no experience doing it, but I did it the old fashioned way. I just networked. I just called people on the phone.\
\
[00:16:52.000] - Debbie\
Remember, we have phones, okay? I had no money. I couldn't even afford to go to Starbucks to meet with people. I literally just called people and I didn't ask them if I could work for them. I told them what I was able to do.\
\
[00:17:08.140] - Debbie\
I was able to get a lot of traffic from SEO on my blog. Do you know anybody else that might need help? Do you know anyone else that I might be able to help? It's a much less threatening call. You're not begging for someone to hire you.\
\
[00:17:26.740] - Debbie\
You're not begging for someone to do a little bit of stuff with you. You're simply asking them, telling them what you can do, asking them if they know anybody that might need that help. And by the way, many people don't. But you have to keep calling because eventually you will find people that do. Okay?\
\
[00:17:47.100] - Debbie\
The next step. And so many people miss this, and it is so critical. It will help you out in even evaluating what ideas you are considering. This is simple math. Do not over complicate it.\
\
[00:18:03.120] - Debbie\
You can use a calculator. You can write this on a piece of paper and figure it out. But just do the math. So, the simple math is how much do you need per month or per time period, whatever that is. How much can you charge or charge per hour or charge per unit, it's the same philosophy as you'll see, and then divide the two by each other to figure out how many units you need. If you have a goal, you will work towards that goal, and you will make it happen. All right, here's an example. So, suppose you need to make an extra $1,000 a month. How much can you charge per hour or per unit?\
\
[00:18:54.410] - Debbie\
And let's just suppose we're going to start on the lower side. It's $25 an hour. And I chose 25 because it's on the lower side, and also because it's easy math. All right? But if it's $15 an hour, that's fine.\
\
[00:19:10.560] - Debbie\
I personally charge for my services $75 an hour. But it doesn't matter. It's not the point. So, suppose you can just charge $25 an hour for what you're doing. If I need an extra $1,000 a month, that means that I need to work and get paid for 40 hours a month.\
\
[00:19:32.440] - Debbie\
That's it. 40 hours, okay? That is just 10 hours per week. Or set another way, 2 hours every work day of the week. You can space it out however you want, but that is the math.\
\
[00:19:49.410] - Debbie\
Now, if you're able to charge $50 an hour, that number is cut in half. And so, this is really important, because you are going to want to be able to charge more of a premium for whatever it is that you do. But at the same time, I'm going to tell you just to get started. Get your foot in the door. Get your feet wet.\
\
[00:20:16.830] - Debbie\
Pick a number that you feel is a good trade and good value for someone to pay you for whatever it is that you're going to do. And it's basically an easy yes offer. They will say yes to it. If that's $15 an hour, do it. If it's $25 an hour, do it.\
\
[00:20:36.170] - Debbie\
You will work your way up over time. Okay. So the next step in here, which is just a variation, is you're going to think about how you can package your service. So, you might do this in ten hour increments. Your service can be anything.\
\
[00:20:55.680] - Debbie\
It can be creating pins on Pinterest, or scheduling pins on Pinterest, or writing blog posts, whatever the heck it is, okay? But people often, unless they're hiring you to be a virtual assistant, often people won't like the idea of paying you per hour. It's hard for many of them because they don't know how many hours something is going to take. So think about packaging it. Like, it's going to take 10 hours to schedule all these pins or whatever, or do all these posts on Facebook, or do whatever it is that you're doing.\
\
[00:21:37.060] - Debbie\
And so, if I'm getting paid $25 an hour, and I'm going to do it in ten hour increments per month, that means each package is $250. And by the way, I just made up that number, $250. For easy math, your package can be $500 or $300, or you could have more than one package.\
\
[00:22:01.180] - Debbie\
And that's totally fine. But think about it from the customers' point of view, they are going to pay for something. What are they getting and how much is that going to cost them? Do it in a way that makes sense for them and makes sense for you. So, if I need $1,000 a month and I divide it by 250, that means I only need to get four customers a month.\
\
[00:22:28.000] - Debbie\
Okay, this is just in the example of I'm getting paid for my services.\
\
[00:22:34.690] - Debbie\
Use whatever breakdown makes sense for you and over time, scale up. As you get more experience, you can do things faster. You can charge more. You can either charge more to the same customer or more to future customers, or you can scale up the level of your services to get to a place that you are able to charge more per hour or you are able to use tools that will save you time, so you can basically do it in less. So, you're effectively making more per hour.\
\
[00:23:06.650] - Debbie\
All right, make sure that you can build up to your buckets with the building blocks and I will give you more examples in a second. For me, I was freelancing as I said. I was charging $75 an hour. Right away or fairly quickly, I was able to find two clients. One was paying me 8 hours a week and the other was paying me 4 hours a week.\
\
[00:23:35.670] - Debbie\
When I did the math, that came out to $3,600 a month, assuming there were four weeks in a month. Again, being conservative with the numbers because technically most months are 4.2 weeks or whatever. But then my task was to find some other way to make up an extra $400. So, I often found some one off clients that I might do something for, for let's say 2 hours.\
\
[00:24:05.460] - Debbie\
And I just had to find two of those per month.\
\
[00:24:11.090] - Debbie\
Then my other job was doing painting estimates. I basically worked on commissions only. If I didn't sell anything, I didn't make anything. So, with painting, the average job size was $4,000. My commission was 10%, which meant on average, I would make $400 per job sold. Some I made more, some I made less.\
\
[00:24:37.050] - Debbie\
Yes, it did vary week to week and a little bit month to month, but more so week to week. I probably had a close rate of around 35%. I knew on my flooring business, which was somewhat similar, my rate was around 40%, maybe 42%. So, I figured I don't know nearly as much about painting. There's more competition and painting, therefore 35% rate is reasonable.\
\
[00:25:06.650] - Debbie\
So, when I did the math for that and figured out how much I needed per month and how much I could close per month, I basically came out with I need to get 18 appointments per month or whatever that number is, divided by four to kind of say per week. It's okay if I'm off by an appointment or two on this week. As long as I make it up next week, but I can't let it go on more than that. But think about that with everything that you're doing. What is the simple math to get you to your number, just to basic division?\
\
[00:25:45.460] - Debbie\
Use a calculator. All right. So, now, in terms of the main ways that you can make money and the main ways to calculate your building blocks, ads are obviously for many of us, one of the first ways that we can make money on our blog. It is not really the most profitable way for most of us, but it's definitely one of the ways that works for many of us at an earlier stage.\
\
[00:26:15.950] - Debbie\
Okay. So, if you're making money on ads and you want to make more money from ads, figure out what your Rpm is. That could be per session or per page view. It doesn't really matter, okay. And right now, I'm recording this in December when the ad rates are kind of at their highest. And when you're listening to this, it should be January when the ad rates are typically the lowest.\
\
[00:26:44.120] - Debbie\
So, don't forget to account for that and the seasonality in there. So, if you know your Rpm and you need to make an extra $1,000 a month, just do the math. 1,000 divided by whatever your current Rpm is, that's how many incremental page views or sessions you need to make. And then figure out how you're going to get that. You know how many blog posts you're going to do, or whatever it is you're going to do to get that extra traffic.\
\
[00:27:14.730] - Debbie\
If you are selling products and doesn't really matter if this or your own shop, figure out what your average size is, or your average cart size, if you will, or how much money you're making, and then how much more you need to sell. So, if you earn, let's say, $4 on average for a product that's sold, you're going to have to sell a lot of those versus if you make 40 per product, you only need to sell like a 10th of that. Okay, but just do the math. Whatever it is, make sure you look at your profit, not just your revenue. If you're offering services, basically do it on a per project, per client, per hour basis, like I just showed you.\
\
[00:28:03.930] - Debbie\
If you're going to make more on affiliate marketing, it's basically the same as products or ads. How much are you making per affiliate sale? How much more do you need to make? If you're doing sponsored posts, how much do you get paid on average per sponsored post? How many sponsored posts you need to meet your goal? Or what can you do to raise the rate that you charge per sponsored post?\
\
[00:28:31.800] - Debbie\
Again, it's all math, and it's not that hard if you have a calculator. All right, so the five main ways to monetize and the drivers that get you there. For ad revenue, by far the easiest and most passive way to do this is through SEO traffic. That's what I have done for years. If you're making more on Pinterest or TikTok or wherever, just figure out the math and how you're going to do it. But I'd recommend SEO Traffic, hands down.\
\
[00:29:10.750] - Debbie\
All right. Affiliate marketing. The way to really drive that is either one of these three main ways. You can do all three or just one, or do two of the three, but it's SEO traffic, it's email marketing or YouTube. Those are three most effective ways by far.\
\
[00:29:30.630] - Debbie\
All right? Sponsored post is the third thing, which is basically the rate you can charge is based on traffic and social media and to some extent, the size of your email list. If you're making money on products, generally, it's your email list that drives it. So, how can you sell more to your email list? Or how can you increase the size of your email list? Or how can you increase the frequency that you email them?\
\
[00:30:00.540] - Debbie\
If you are in a marketplace, that's another place that you can drive sales, either, you know, like a place like Etsy or Ravelry or wherever, usually there, if you're already on there, it's going to be a matter of making more products. Okay. If you're not on there, consider getting on one of those if it is relevant. I actually have been selling products for many years, but now I've gone into Etsy and well, I'm not going to tell you that I'm making a ton of money. I am making good progress and my progress on that has been much faster versus if I started doing it on a non-existent email list.\
\
[00:30:43.180] - Debbie\
Okay, so if you go in a place like Etsy, you don't need to have an email list, but you can get started right away. If it's services that you offer, your drivers are going to be your clients and later, your email list from those clients or potential clients. All right, the key takeaways here, because there's only so much I can cover in this time period. But if you need money and stability right away, then my direction to you is figure out a service or some sort of active income that you can do to get money in the door quickly. Just do it.\
\
[00:31:23.230] - Debbie\
Or figure out an additional service that you can offer, so then you create another additional income stream. Be sure to treat your blog like a business. I am not telling you to invest tons of money, but definitely, there are some things, especially as you go along, that you can invest in as you go along, that will improve your efficiency. Do them because it will enable you to get more done in less time. And time is money.\
\
[00:31:56.070] - Debbie\
Especially, time is money if you are being paid essentially by the hour or by the project. So, don't be afraid to do that. Do not spend tons of money, but do spend some money, whether that's to improve your efficiency or your learning, so you can earn more. And have a plan. Those who fail to plan, fail. So that when the next one comes, even if it's larger, even if it's like $10,000, like I started to get as I went along. The larger ones are easier to take care of because you have the ability to learn how to do this, to learn how to plan.\
\
[00:32:39.650] - Debbie\
I also want to remind you that in the depression, the most number of millionaires were created. Furthermore, during depressions and recessions and whatever panics have happened over the last, I don't know, 200 years or so, some of the best companies were formed, and they are around here today. Even ones from the 18 hundreds and the early 19 hundreds, they are still here. Why? Because when there are problems, there are people that have problems and people that need solutions.\
\
[00:33:21.740] - Debbie\
Your job is just figure out how you can solve those problems. So, look at this as an opportunity, not a problem. It's a short-term setback for a long-term gain. Okay, so now what do I have for you? I have a little freebie, and this is a little printable.\
\
[00:33:45.350] - Debbie\
Actually, you can look at it on the computer or print it out, whatever makes the most sense. But it's basically seven easy ways to monetize online. So, you can quit your job, that's what it's called. But really, it doesn't matter if you have a job or you don't have a job. It's really seven easy ways to monetize online, so you can earn more and/or you can quit your job sooner.\
\
[00:34:10.180] - Debbie\
So, I hope that is helpful for you. Again. My name is Debbie Gartner. You can find my freebie down below and my website, which I forgot to mention is the flooringgirl.com. All right, I will catch you guys.\
\
[00:34:25.720] - Debbie\
Hope to see you around. Thanks so much for listening and good luck with making your goals. I know you can do it.\

[00:00:11.660] - Janet LeBlanc\
Hey there. Are you worried about getting a scary letter from the IRS or from the government in the mail when you start your new blogging business? Well, fear not, because today I am here to give you that Finance 101, that tax 101 manual that you wish you would have gotten in the mail instead when you start your new blog and you're working to make money from it. We're going to fix that fear and that overwhelm and that confusion and that mystery together today. Hey there. My name is Janet LeBlanc. I'm the founder of a business called Paper + Spark. I'm a CPA that provides financial education and bookkeeping resources for creative entrepreneurs, artists, makers, and bloggers like yourself. And today, I'm thrilled to chat with you about Finance 101, particularly for new bloggers. So, for baby bloggers who are just starting their blogging journey and their new business journey, I know that there is a lot of confusion and overwhelm on this topic out there, or maybe just a lack of information. And it's not the sexiest topic I will admit. It's probably not the most fun thing you're going to learn about during the summit, but it is really necessary.\
\
[00:01:26.910] - Janet\
And I'm going to make it quick. I'm going to break it down in plain English. And I can guarantee the best part is that once you learn this stuff, you're going to feel so much better. It's not rocket science. It's easier than we think it is. So, we're going to learn all about getting those financial ducks in a row for your new business, whether you've even considered a business or not. And we're going to feel more confident so that you can move on to writing, marketing, and making a whole lot of money with your blog. Right? Sound good? Let's go. So, let's figure this out. Is your blog even a business? What do I have to do or be or how much money do I have to make in order to actually be considered a business? So, again, I'm a CPA here in the US, so, a lot of the tax rules that I'm going to be talking about today are going to be related to the US only. Keep that in mind if you're located outside of the US. But here we have something called the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. They're the people that are in charge of our federal income taxes, both for you on a personal level and your business.\
\
[00:02:33.770] - Janet\
And in the eyes of the IRS, it's all about your intent when it comes to running that blog or doing that online activity. Are you running that activity with the reasonable expectation of earning a profit? You don't actually have to be earning a profit yet. You don't have to hit a certain sales or net income threshold before you're considered a business. Again, in the eyes of the IRS, they're really just concerned about your intent. So, if you're here today learning about blogging, setting up your blog - maybe you're already blogging, maybe you're running ads on your site or trying to make affiliate income, or you're considering having printables or digital products on your blog - if you're running that website with the goal of making a profit, then you are considered a business and you want to be acting accordingly. There's not a sales threshold we need to hit, like I said. So, I really encourage you to treat it like a business because it probably is from day one, and that's what we're going to talk about today. And I'll also mention that even if you're doing this activity and you don't have the reasonable expectation of earning a profit, and you're considering this like a hobby and not a business, guess what? We still have to report hobby income for tax purposes. We don't get to just fly under the radar if we don't consider it a business. So, either way, you want to be prepared to deal with these tax responsibilities.\
\
[00:04:08.390] - Janet\
When I say I want you to get your blogging biz legit, what do I mean? I mean operating legally from a government perspective. That means the local, state, and federal government. We have different things going on at different levels. That means knowing what to expect at tax time. When is the tax deadline? What forms do I need to be prepared to file? Who do they go to? There's, again, different things we have to be aware of. Keeping your business stuff, and by that, I usually mean your business funds, your business money, separate from your personal stuff, and running your business like a business. That's really all about having that business mentality, making smart decisions, taking time to look at what's going on behind the scenes of your business, and not just operating willy-nilly. So, this is your basic Finance 101 checklist. I'm going to have a really detailed free checklist for you to download at the end of my presentation today, but sum it up that these are like the financial cornerstones you want to be prepared to deal with when you're getting your new blog business legit.\
\
[00:05:19.850] - Janet\
We want a business bank account. We want a bookkeeping system for our blog. We may need a state sales tax permit if what we're selling is subject to sales tax if you're selling some product. I'll talk about that more later. You'll probably need a "doing business as", it's a DBA or an assumed name license with your local county or city. You may want to go ahead and register for a free EIN, that's Employer Identification Number, with the IRS. That basically replaces your Social Security Number when it comes to all things business paperwork. And you want to know when your different financial deadlines are and what reports you need to file. I'm going to dive into most of these things in more detail, but this is the overall concept you want to be ready to tackle. So, let's talk about banking. You want to have a separate bank account for your blog. Why? A few reasons. It just makes doing your books easier. So, when you go update your blog's books, you don't want to have to be crawling through personal and business transactions in one place. That takes a really long time to sort through stuff.\
\
[00:06:38.720] - Janet\
You want to have all your business transactions in just one easier place. In the unlikely event you ever do get audited by the government, it also makes the audit process a lot smoother for both you and the auditor, and we always want to be in an auditor's good graces. It helps you make better financial decisions. So, I can log into my business bank account at any time and see how much money I have in the account. If I'm funding the business and co-mingling the personal and business money in one account, it's hard for me to see how much the business is making. If I'm at a profit or loss or not, I'm going to accidentally pay for things out of my personal funds, that sort of thing. It's also just often the legit business thing to do. If you are going to register as an LLC, you definitely are required to have a separate business bank account. If you're going to be a sole proprietor, then it's not necessarily legally required of you to have a separate business account, but I still highly, highly recommend it. In this day and age, there are plenty of free online business checking account options like Bluevine or Novo. So, there's really nothing holding you back from opening that business checking account for your blog.\
\
[00:07:51.830] - Janet\
Let's move on to Bookkeeping. So, Bookkeeping is just a fancy word for keeping track of your transactions in some sort of system, the ins and outs of money in your business, your sales, and your expenses. Bookkeeping is logging those sales and expenses every month, ideally, in some sort of system. There's no best system for me to recommend. The best system for you is whatever clicks best with how your brain works. Because the most important thing with the Bookkeeping system is that we keep it updated consistently. I see so many entrepreneurs wait until the end of the year to update their books, or the week before the tax deadline to update their books. It's a really stressful process, and you are missing out on deductions, because there's no way you can remember everything that happened over the past year and have receipts for all of that stuff if you're stressed for time doing it right before the deadline. So, pick a Bookkeeping system that works well for how your brain works. You understand it. You can visually see everything you need to do. You understand how to use it and update it consistently.\
\
[00:09:03.780] - Janet\
Set up those healthy habits. Like I said, I would aim to update your business books once a month is a good goal. And set up some system around keeping your digital and physical paperwork. By that, I really mean your receipts, your invoices, organized. If you do happen to decide to sell physical inventory as part of your blog business, like if you're going to sell shirts or something or prints for instance, you want to make sure that your Bookkeeping system, whatever you choose, also allows you to track physical inventory and cost of goods sold. Not all easy, simple, newbie Bookkeeping systems do that, so I just want to point that out in case it applies to you. Bookkeeping allows us to see where our different streams of revenue are coming from. So, as bloggers, you're very likely going to have different arms of your business. You're going to have money coming in from different places. You may be having ad income, influencer income, or affiliate income. You may have digital downloads that you're selling. You may be working with brands and having collaborations, so you want to be able to record all the different streams of income and easily see how each arm of your business is doing.\
\
[00:10:19.970] - Janet\
That means we've got to be tracking it in our Bookkeeping system. A good Bookkeeping system and keeping it up to date allows you to know where you want to focus your time and energy, and you can pivot and tweak your business model when necessary. If we don't have this data, we just can't make the best decisions. We're relying on our feelings or our emotions instead of the actual data, and sometimes our feelings may betray us, but the numbers don't lie. Right? And you want to have those totals, the margins, the KPIs, the good metrics in order to make smart decisions for how to run your blog and use your time wisely. A good Bookkeeping system is also really important for keeping track of your deductions. We don't always have a lot of expenses as bloggers. If you're not selling physical products, it may be harder for you to get as many deductions as you want to get at tax time. So, keeping track of your books consistently really means that you are going to be able to maximize taking all the deductions that you actually qualified for throughout the year. And by deduction, I mean a business expense.\
\
[00:11:29.840] - Janet\
So, when you're updating your books, you want to make sure you always remember to track your business expenses. Those are things that are ordinary and necessary in the course of running your blogging business. So, that could be things like the education and training that you're signing up for here today, if you buy the VIP pass, for instance. It could be your website and domain fees. If you're paying for your domain; if you're paying for web hosting, your cloud hosting; if you're paying for any other sorts of training; if you're paying for marketing or advertising like Google ads perhaps; if you have credit card processing fees that you pay when your customer buys a digital download from you, these are all things that we can deduct as business expenses. Keywords that we're looking for for a tax deduction or a business expense that we record in our books are ordinary and necessary for running your business. Okay. That's what the IRS is looking for. It has to be an ordinary and necessary expense. So, I know sometimes, especially with blogging, things can get a little fuzzy with buying food for recipes or buying clothes for modeling on Instagram.\
\
[00:12:43.400] - Janet\
Ordinary and necessary in the course of running your business is the filter that you want to pass all those expense questions through. A good Bookkeeping system means that you'll have those numbers that you need at year-end to do your taxes. Here are a couple of Bookkeeping options that are popular for bloggers. We've got QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have Paper + Spark Spreadsheets, that's my business, so I'm a little bit biased. Some people use Wave, which is another software option, or you can even DIY, open Google Sheets and track your sales and expenses in there yourself. At the local level, the one thing that you may need to look into at the local level is a "doing business as" or a fictitious name permit. We call this either a DBA, a fictitious name permit, or an assumed name permit or license. Different areas will call it different things. This is basically a registration that tells the public, notifies the public and the government that you are running a business under a name that's different than your legal name. So, if I ran a business that was just called janetleblanc.com, that's my name, then I don't necessarily need a DBA.\
\
[00:13:58.480] - Janet\
But I run a business called Paper and Spark. So, if your blog name, your brand or business name is different than your legal name, you're guilty or the local government body where you are, likely requires you to have this DBA, fictitious name permit just to let everyone know that your business is actually you, even though it has a different name. This may be something that you need to look into to check off your list in getting legit.\
\
[00:14:27.860] - Janet\
Let's move on to taxes. So, these are state and federal-level taxes here. The main type of tax we need to be prepared to deal with is income tax, and income tax is at the federal level with the IRS. And if your state has income taxes, then you also are going to be dealing with income tax at the state level. As part of income taxes, you may also owe self-employment tax. This is like the equivalent of what your employer, if you have a regular day job, would withhold from your paycheck each payroll period. This is our version because we don't have payroll as self-employed people, so we pay that as self-employment tax instead.\
\
[00:15:11.430] - Janet\
We have income tax on our net income, so that's sales minus expenses. I'll dive into this in detail in a second. Estimated quarterly taxes is if you are going to prepay your income tax bill, so only if you expect you're going to owe. And then totally different animal here, we have sales tax. So, sales taxes are governed by your state's Department of Revenue. Not every state has sales taxes. But if you do have sales tax, it's usually only going to be applicable to your business if you're selling products. Physical products, 98% of the time, are subject to sales tax. Digital products are subject to sales tax in about 50% of the states here in the US. So, if you're not selling any sort of physical or digital product, if your income is mostly going to be affiliate, advertising, influencer, brand collabs, that sort of thing with your blog, then you probably don't need to worry about sales taxes at all. If you're going to be selling digital downloads, you need to figure out if digital products are subject to sales tax in your state or not. If you're going to be selling physical products, then most likely you definitely need to deal with sales tax and get your sales tax permit.\
\
[00:16:34.580] - Janet\
I have more resources about sales taxes on my website. It's really complicated, so I don't want to dive deep into that topic here in order to keep it brief and brain-friendly for today. So, if you have more questions about sales tax in your business, feel free to reach out. Let's talk about income taxes, though, specifically, Federal Income Tax. So, we've established that you're a business if you are running your blog with the intent or the reasonable expectation to make a profit. If you're a sole provider, which you default to when you are a single person running a business, there's not a partnership, or if you're a single member LLC - you got that LLC registration, which you generally don't need to do as a baby business - but in case you already have, then you're going to be wanting to fill out the Schedule C at tax time. Schedule C is the tax form that you want to be prepared to deal with to report income taxes for your blog. It goes with your personal tax form, the Form 1040, and it's due on April 15th with your personal taxes. So, It's not a separate thing that you file apart from your personal taxes, or you and your family or you and your spouse's taxes. It goes with that.\
\
[00:17:50.710] - Janet\
The Schedule C is a two-page form. I encourage you to Google it, print it out, look at it, get friendly with it. If you see it now, then it's easier to do your books each month because you have a better idea of what you're going to be asked to report on that form. Those are the things that you need to be tracking each month so that you have the year-end totals to go here on the Schedule C. We could dive in-depth into each line on the Schedule C, but I'm going to give a brief overview again. Look at it on your own when you have time. It boils down to basically reporting your sales. So, all those different revenue streams we talked about, those are going to be your income in part one of the Schedule C. And then you get to subtract out all your expenses, those business deductions. So, you want to see what type of things they're asking for: advertising, office supplies, professional services, all sorts of things. You can look here and see what sort of deductions you want to be tracking. And then later on, we subtract the expenses from the income you reported.\
\
[00:19:03.940] - Janet\
And the net result is either a net profit, meaning you made money, or a net loss, meaning you spent more than you made. The end result of that calculation, that net profit or loss, will travel over to your personal Form 1040. It's going to get added to any other income you make. Or if you're reporting married filing jointly with a spouse, it will get added to their income as well. So, your blog isn't going to be taxed in a vacuum all by itself. It gets added to and lumped in with whatever's going on in your personal finances as well. I mentioned that we have sometimes a debate between, is my blog a business or is it a hobby? I just wanted to point out this form, the Schedule One, also goes with your Form 1040. If you're considering your activity a business, then that Schedule C net profit or loss will travel over here to line three. They do change the line numbers every few years, so don't be alarmed if 2023, 2024 ends up looking different. And then you put your hobby sales. If you don't consider yourself a business and you're not filling out that Schedule C, you still have to report those hobby sales over here on what is currently line through 8J.\
\
[00:20:26.370] - Janet\
But the trick with the hobby sales is you don't get to subtract your deductions, okay? So, it's not super beneficial to treat yourself like a hobby. You want to be considering yourself a business so that you can subtract those expenses. And then you just put the net result here on part one. All this gets added together if you have anything else to report here, and it travels from line 10 over to your main Form 1040, where again, it's going to get lumped in with your personal financial situation. So, that is a broad overview of the basic steps to getting your financial ducks in a row for a new blog business. We want to be prepared to deal with that Schedule C at tax time, that's the biggest thing. We want to be keeping track of our numbers and our bookkeeping system year-round so that we know what to report. You may need to get that local level DBA, "doing business as" license. You may need to get a sales tax permit with your state. Those are basically the big things, and getting that bank account. I think a lot of times we have this question mark of how do I officially become a business? Do I need to register, fill out some paperwork?\
\
[00:21:41.680] - Janet\
When we start selling online or making affiliate income online with that intent to make a profit, you default to being a sole proprietorship, if there's one of you. If you're doing it or you're doing someone else like a partnership, you would default to being a partnership. But that's usually not the case for blogging, right? So, I just want you to know, there are not necessarily hoops you need to jump through other than the ones I've mentioned to officially be considered a business. Bottom line, when you start making money online, the federal government wants to know about it. They want their piece of the pie. No surprise there. So, don't necessarily think you can fly under the radar until some magical event or threshold happens. This is what you need to be prepared to deal with from the beginning. What are some things we can do to make this easier? Get that Bookkeeping system and possibly an inventory system set up. Start doing that research now so that you can start tracking those numbers in a system that works for you. Get educated on what we need to track and record throughout the year.\
\
[00:22:58.920] - Janet\
Look at that tax form. If you're not filing the Schedule C, figure out whatever form you are going to be filing and get familiar with it now, not a week before it's due. That's going to be really stressful for you. Set yourself up for healthy Bookkeeping habits. That may be making checklists, sending alerts on your calendar or in your phone on the first of each month to go update your bookkeeping system. Bribing yourself - 'Once I update my books, I can get a massage' - or whatever you're easily motivated by. Save throughout the year for your tax bill, if applicable. So ,if you think you're going to owe at tax time, you want to be setting that money aside throughout the year, so you're not hit with any surprise bills, and get proactive. Anything that I touched on today that felt confusing to you, write it down. Make a plan for how you're going to get that question answered. Hopefully, it doesn't involve just like going down a Google or Facebook forum rabbit hole. Reach out to an accountant, or you're welcome to reach out to me. I think we have a Facebook group that we can chat in for this summit.\

**Transcript:**\
Jeannette Spencer [00:00:00]:\
Hi, Hi, everyone. My name is Jeannette and I'm the founder of the Women's Entrepreneurial Network and I'm super excited to be here with you all today. So I'm literally just gonna jump straight into this workshop. So I firstly wanna start by taking you back a few years to a time when I was kind of in the early stages of building my own blog and business. So back then, I did have a relatively decent amount of traffic flowing through my website. People were reading my content and people were engaging and even sharing it which was amazing, but when it actually came to turn in those readers into customers, there was a huge disconnect. So I was spending a lot of time crafting what I thought were high value blog posts hoping that they would turn it into leads and sales, but what I noticed is the moment that I would include some kind of offer or make some kind of pitch, I start to feel really uncomfortable. And this was mainly because I was scared about coming across too salesy or that somehow I was kind of undermining the trust that I was building with my audience.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:01:17]:\
And this is a struggle that I know a lot of entrepreneurs generally have. You know, we wanna serve our readers. We wanna serve our customers. We wanna share stories and we wanna provide value because those are pretty much the heartbeats of why most of us start blogging in the first place, but at the same time, we're business owners and part of that process is to grow our businesses and actually make money. Right? This was the dilemma that I was stuck in for so so long. You know, I wanted to create an income from my blog but I didn't know how to kind of make that transition without it feeling forced or transactional. For so many of us, our blog start as a passion project or a creative outlet, but then as they grow and as our traffic and reach grows, they have the potential to become really powerful engines for our business. And when we actually start viewing our blogs not just as a place where we can share content but as a strategic piece of our overall business strategy, we can really start to see what's possible.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:02:25]:\
Now to be able to create an active revenue stream, you kinda need to think of your blog as more than just a place to share your thoughts. You need to think of your blog as the first stage of a journey that you're inviting your readers to join which is potentially gonna bring them from being casual readers to actually engaging and ultimately becoming loyal customers of yours. And the journey is made possible through something that's called a sales funnel. Now for those of you who don't know, a sales funnel at its core is simply a way of kind of guiding your audience from discovering your content to them ultimately seeing the value that you're able to provide with your offers. Whatever that might be, it could be anything. You know, your funnel doesn't feel salesy or it shouldn't feel salesy or pushy. What it should be is helpful and it should feel purposeful and most importantly, it should feel natural. So during this session, I'm gonna be diving into how to build a blog based sales funnel that really does start to feel natural.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:03:28]:\
And this includes how to structure your blog content in a way that doesn't inform, but that also engages and encourages your readers to take the next step, How to move readers through your journey that feels aligned with your mission and your audience's needs and then most importantly, how to make sales feel like a natural part of your blog's experience. So somewhere where readers are able to come and feel empowered and feel served and not directly feel sold to. So this is pretty much about making an impact that also drives income because you know, let's be real. That's what we all kind of wanna do. We wanna be creating content and we wanna run businesses that we love and that provide value to people but that generate us enough income to be able to live the lives that we wanna live. Right? So whether you're new to this idea of sales funnels or whether you're just looking to refine your approach, what my hope is is that you'll be able to create a system that's as seamless as it is possible. Alright. So now that we've covered why a sales funnel is so valuable for bloggers, what I'm gonna do is just dive into what a sales funnel actually looks like and how it applies specifically to blogging.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:04:39]:\
So a traditional sales funnel consists of 3 main stages and these stages are awareness, consideration and conversion. So when applied to blogging, each of these stages serves a specific purpose. So let's start with stage 1, which we know is the awareness stage and this is where you're kind of bringing new people into your orbit. So your awareness stage content is obviously what you're gonna be using to attract new readers and these are people who are just discovering your blog or maybe even just discovering your industry for the first time. Now to attract readers to your blog, you need content that is going to pull them in and pique their interest and also that's tailored to your target audience's needs. So at this stage, what's important is that your content provides tons and tons of value and I'm stressing that because right now, I don't want you to focus too much on selling. So remember that awareness is about giving first and the reason that we take this approach is so that when our readers come come across our blog and find helpful free information, they're a lot more likely to come back. They're a lot more likely to engage with more of your content and kind of check out what else is that you have on offer.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:05:54]:\
Now once you actually start attracting readers, you're gonna wanna move them into the consideration stage, which is the engagement phase and this is where you start building a relationship with your audience. So this stage is all about kind of that deeper, more meaningful engagement and it's where your reader readers are gonna start thinking of you as more of an expert expert and someone who can help them solve a specific problem. So when it comes to some effective ways that you can kind of keep them engaged, you could create a blog series, which is a really good way for you to get your readers to keep coming back to your blog. So you can use each part of your blog series to dive into some of the different aspects on a particular topic which then builds interest and again gives your readers a reason to stay engaged and keep coming back. Next, you can also offer free resources or exclusive content like an in-depth guide or a mini course that can be offered in exchange for someone's email address. By offering something extra that's useful, what you're actually doing is giving your readers a taste of the value that you can provide and also getting them interested in the idea of actually working with you in a paid capacity later on down the line. And then lastly, it's super important to be consistent with your content, making sure that you are creating high value pieces every time. So blogging is really good at helping you build credibility and being consistent is a big part of that.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:07:22]:\
But what's more important is actually creating really high value and quality content, which is really gonna be what's able to establish you as an authority in your field. If readers know that every time they visit your blog, they're gonna walk away with some actionable advice or some really good information, they're gonna be more likely to see you as the go to source and as I mentioned, to keep coming back. And then finally, we have the conversion stage which is where you kind of transition your readers from being fans to becoming customers. Now when it comes to converting readers, the key is to keep your sales messaging really subtle and also helpful whilst using sales tactics. And the easiest way to do this is to just provide them with a solution. So a few soft sales tactics that I wanna share with you that you can include in your blog content are product and service mentions. So let's say you write in a tutorial and you have a product or a service that fits naturally within the context. So what you wanna do is include a small section that says something similar to, if you're looking for a done for you solution, check out and then your your product.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:08:38]:\
So that would be a link within your blog. Very subtle. So using this kind of approach feels a lot more natural than kind of going in straight with a hard sales pitch. You could also use or share stories on how your product or service has helped other people, which again is another gentle way that you can show potential customers what they stand to gain without overtly saying to them. And this works really well because people tend to love relatable examples when they're able to see themselves in the success of others. Now moving on to call to actions. Now I think it's important for me to say that not every blog post that you create is gonna need a strong call to action. But when it feels relevant, it is your job to guide readers to take the next step, and that could be signing up for a webinar.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:09:28]:\
It could be downloading your free guide or it could be checking out your product or, you know, directing someone to a sales page. Something else that I think is worth saying is you definitely want to try to make your blog CTA's conversational. So for example, you could say something like, if you're ready to dive in deeper, here's a resource that I think you're gonna love. Again, very subtle. No direct pitch and you know, it just reads a lot better and, you know, when your readers are on your your site, they're not gonna feel like you're directly trying to sell something, but more like you're trying to be helpful. So in each of these three stages, so awareness, consideration and conversion, what you're actually doing is gradually moving readers through the blog funnel without overwhelming them with any strong sales messages. And what you'll also find is that by using this approach, you're creating a genuine connection with your readers and providing them with value and ultimately leading them towards a sale in a way that feels like the natural next step in your relationship. Right.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:10:35]:\
So now we've looked at the foundation of a blog based sales funnel, now what I wanna do is just speak about selling in a way that respects this relationship and that keeps the authenticity that we will value. But before we dive into the methods of selling, I wanna address the elephant in the room which is always sales resistance. So as I mentioned earlier, I know that for a lot of bloggers or just business owners in general, the idea of selling can sometimes feel a little bit uncomfortable. You might be worried about seeming too pushy or you might feel like you're risking your hard earned readers' trust and you know, you're not alone. This is one of the biggest challenges for content creators across all across all platforms. But to know how to deal with this, we kind of need to understand why we and why our readers resist sales tactics. And it's pretty simple. It's because we know that our readers don't generally come to our blogs to be sold to.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:11:31]:\
They come for valuable information, insights and also solutions. And so the moment they feel like they're being pitched to or pressured into a cell, it triggers resistance and that's when they jump off the page. Again, our readers are looking for value and then, you know, they're looking for answers to their problem, they're looking for tips, that are gonna make their lives easier or content that's able to inspire them to take some kind of action. This is why I would definitely recommend using an approach which is called solutions first, offer second, and this is where you can transform your mind into kind of thinking of selling as helping rather than pushing. So what you need to do is kind of focus on providing a solution to a problem that your readers are genuinely experiencing, which makes it so much easier for you to then position your product or your service as the natural answer. So by shifting your mindset from selling to serving, what you're actually gonna probably find is that the process of converting the customer is gonna become a lot smoother and feel a lot more genuine and a lot less sleazy. So you might be wondering how do you even position your offers in a way that feels natural and like the next step in your reader's journey? Well, one of the best ways to do this is by is by creating problem solving content And this is where, you know, you think of the most common pain points that your readers are experiencing and you address those problems directly in your blog posts. So for example, let's say your audience struggles with time management.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:13:12]:\
What you could do is create a post which you could call something like 5 strategies to take control of your time, and then within the post, after you've provided real actionable strategies that you know someone who is struggling with this issue is gonna find valuable, what you would then do is kind of naturally mention your productivity planner or, you know, your time management course or whatever else it is that you sell as that deeper solution for them. And keep in mind that storytelling is super powerful here. So instead of, simply listing the benefits of your product or service, if possible, you wanna be sharing stories or real life transformation. So talk about a client or a customer or even a friend who's faced the same challenge as your reader and explain how your solution has helped them to overcome it. So using storytelling as a sales tactic really does help to build a connection that goes way beyond the transaction. And this is pretty much because it's relatable and it makes the reader see themselves in the success of others which is way more compelling than any sales pitch is ever gonna be. Right. So once we've framed our first the solution, the next step is then to invite readers to take some kind of action in a way that feels friendly, natural and also aligned with the content that they're they're reading.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:14:35]:\
So for example, you might wanna add a banner to your blog post which encourages people to download freely. So if your post is about goal setting, you know, what you could do is offer something like a goal setting worksheet, but then put something on the page that stands out and that again is the natural next step. So if someone's reading, a blog post about setting goals there and there's a banner there to download a free worksheet, then it's a no brainer to just download that worksheet, which means that they're actually jumping on your email list which again is what you want. And then after someone downloads it, you could then introduce your paid offer on say, master in productivity by way of adding a tripwire. So something that pops up once they've downloaded the free offer to just make them aware or try and get them to buy a paid offer straight away. Or another thing that you can do is just add them directly to an automated email sequence that you can use to nurture and sell to them later on. So this way, what you're actually doing is leading them down a path that starts with value and that builds naturally towards your paid offer. So if you're sharing a tutorial on your blog, you could mention products or tools as part of the process.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:15:55]:\
So again, for example, you would say something like, I love using my customized notion planner for organizing my projects. It's been a game changer. If you're interested, you can check it out here. And again, you would just simply leave a link. Very subtle. Remember your call to actions should feel friendly and kind of nudge rather than be kind of selling like pitching or hard selling. So think of phrases like, if you're ready to dive in a little deeper, hear something I think you'll love or when you're ready, this is the next step to take and then you would literally just add a little bit of maybe information or one liner about your product product and then just add the link. This way, you create a supportive atmosphere that invites your readers to explore without feeling pressured.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:16:48]:\
So it's all about making them feel valued and making them feel empowered in their journey. Okay. So next, let's look at how to maintain your reader's trust during the sales process. Now as we know, trust is everything. Once you've built it, the last thing that you wanna do is lose it by coming across as insincere or overly profit driven. And one of the most effective ways to maintain trust is by being transparent. So an example of how you would actually be transparent with your readers is like say you were adding an affiliate product. What you would wanna do is add some kind of really like simple disclaimer.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:17:28]:\
Something that says something like, I may earn a small commission if you choose to purchase, but I only recommend products I truly believe in. Something like this goes a really long way when it comes to building transparency and also building trust. And then next, always provide more than you take. So this principle is literally one of the core values in sustainable sales. So your readers should always feel like they're getting value from your content even if they don't buy anything. So even if they choose not to buy. So for example, in a post where you're promoting a paid course or you know, some kind of other offer, you really wanna be given some substantial tips and action actionable advice within the blog post itself. This is because that way, whether they decide to make a purchase or not, they're still walking away feeling like they gained something which is super powerful.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:18:18]:\
And then when it comes to balancing sales with value, try to offer content that's 80% value and 20% sales. This balance is what kind of keeps your audience engaged without overwhelming them with constant offers. Trust me. When people see that you're there to help them 1st and sell second, it really does build trust and long term loyalty which really does impact your bottom line. So in each of these three methods, you're presenting offers as helpful suggestions and not as pressure tactics. And by delivering solutions that your readers need, by positioning cells as a way to serve and keeping your communication transparent and friendly, what you'll find is that selling without the sleaze is not only possible but it's super effective. Alright. Now that we've explored the mechanics of a sales funnel and discussed how to sell without compromising your authenticity, In this final section, what I wanna do is just bring it all together by walking you through an example of a blog post that moves readers from awareness to conversion.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:19:21]:\
So keeping in line with the example that I used earlier, I actually do have a blog post on my website called 5 strategies for managing your time more effectively which I'm gonna be referring to during this walkthrough. So for the opening of my post, what I've done is begun by discussing a common pain point that I know people experience when it comes to time management. And this is always gonna be feeling overwhelmed, you know, feeling constantly behind on tasks and struggling to balance work with personal time. So during the opening, it's pretty much where you wanna be speaking to your audience's needs and capturing their attention by actually addressing the problems that they're likely gonna be facing. And the next one I'm doing is walking readers through 5 actionable strategies that they can start using straight away. So each strategy is something easy that they can implement on their own like using a Pomodoro technique, setting realistic goals or planning their day the night before. So this is the value driven content that I know is gonna keep readers engaged and that is gonna build that trust. And then towards the end so for your content, after you've shared your strategies, you might say something like, if these ideas resonate with you and you'd like a step by step framework, for whatever it is your blog post is about, I have a free downloadable worksheet that walks you through blah blah blah.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:20:49]:\
So what you're actually doing here is deepening the engagement by offering a free resource that allows readers to take action beyond the blog post. And this is really, really important when it comes to the kind of follow through to from, awareness to conversion. So this will essentially lead to an email sign up which is a great way for you to build that stronger connection with your audience. And then finally, as you wrap up your post, you might say something like for those of you who are ready to go all in on improving and then whatever it is. So in this example, improving your productivity, my complete time management course dives deep into techniques and includes personalized coaching to help you create a system that works for your lifestyle. So that's just an example. But by positioning your course or your product as a deeper, more comprehensive solution, You make it a natural progression for readers who kind of wanna invest further in solving their problem and it's a gentle nudge. It's not a hard sell and it feels like the next logical step for those people who are truly invested and who truly want to make a change.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:22:05]:\
So what I'm doing is offering something free for those people who maybe are not quite ready to make that financial investment straight away, but who would still like something to help them take action. And the beauty of this is that when they actually download my free offer, I'm then gonna have their email address and be able to sell to them again later on. And then for those people who are ready, because there will be some people who are just ready to take media action, I've also introduced my paid offer. So this approach keeps the flow of the blog post natural and the reader doesn't feel like they're being pushed to buy, but instead, they're given a choice at every step which moves them through the funnel at their own pace. Alright. So now that we've laid the groundwork for turning your readers into loyal customers, let's dive into what you should do once someone actually engages with your content. So this is a crucial step in the sales process because let's face it, some readers, as I mentioned, are gonna jump straight in and make a purchase, but that's not gonna be the the majority. Most people are going to need some kind of extra nudge and that's totally normal.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:23:19]:\
And this is where turning your readers into leads should really become a key part of your blog strategy. And to do this effectively, you do need to really understand your customer's journey and you also need to appreciate that not every reader is gonna be at the same stage in their journey. Some are gonna be, as I mentioned earlier, ready to buy. Others are gonna be just sticking their toes in the water. You know, some people are just gonna wanna be learning more especially before they do something like, again, spend money with you or take the plunge. And your goal is to meet them where they are and guide them through that journey. So once someone engages with your content, maybe they downloaded your free resource or maybe they've subscribed to your email list, that's the time to kick off your follow-up process and you're gonna do this by creating a welcome email sequence. So first, you're gonna welcome them.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:24:14]:\
You're gonna start by sending them a warm, friendly email, thanking them for their interest and letting them know what they can expect from you moving forward. And this is your chance to kind of set the tone for your relationship. So when it comes to your follow-up sequence, you always wanna be providing value. Take note of what made them sign up in the first place. If it was a post that you created on productivity, for example, then you know that that's where their interest lies. So use this insight and over the next few emails that you send out to them, share additional tips, resources, and also insights on this topic. You really wanna use the data that you have to create engaging content that you know they're gonna be interested in. Right? This is actually called email segmentation and this is what will really help to increase your conversions.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:25:08]:\
You also wanna be making sure that these emails are personal and relatable. So don't just send out generic emails. Use your readers' names. You probably already know this stuff. This is very basic stuff and reference their specific interests as I mentioned. Always add your personality and your unique tone, making sure that your email sounds the same or very similar to the voice that you use when you create your blog posts. Also, don't be afraid to share some of your personal experiences with those people on your email list because this type of content is what is essentially gonna make your communication feel a lot more genuine and make it easier for you to continue to build that connection with those people on your email list. And then moving on to social proof.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:25:56]:\
So as I mentioned earlier, people love to see other people win. Right? And they love to see other people succeed especially if they can relate to those experiences. And that's why sharing things like testimonials, sharing reviews and case studies can really work wonders and your emails are a great place for you to share this type of content. When potential customers see that others have benefited from your product, they're more likely to take the plunge themselves. And then it's super important to be offering a transition to sales. So once your leads are engaging with your emails and feeling connected to your content, that's a great time to gently guide them back towards making a purchase. And as you guide your audience, remember that your offers should feel like the natural next step in their journey. Okay.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:26:49]:\
Now lastly, the only way that you're gonna be able to make sure your blog is having the desired impact that you want is to track the data. So write all the blog in a day and it might take a while for you to start seeing consistent engagement and sales from your blog, making it even more important to track your metrics so that you can accurately measure the success of your blog based funnel at each stage. So this is essentially what is gonna help you to be able to understand what's working, what's not working, and also where readers might be dropping off and how to adjust your strategy for better results. Now when it comes to awareness stage metrics, the goal here is to bring new readers to your blog and track metrics like page views, unique visitors, and referral sources, which is pretty much where your traffic is coming from. So for this, I would recommend using a tool like Google Analytics, which is great at providing you with in-depth insights on these kind of metrics and which allows you to see which posts you're creating that are attracting the most traffic and also where your readers are coming from. And then when it comes to the consideration stage, engagement is really key. So I would definitely spend time looking at metrics like the average time on page, the bounce rate and also the scroll depth to see how deeply readers are actually engaging with your content. So you also gonna wanna monitor your email sign ups as these are a really strong indicator of interest and this this is gonna show you how well your content is actually converting your readers into subscribers.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:28:24]:\
And then finally, you should be tracking how many of those readers are actually becoming customers. And to do this, you need to be monitoring your conversion rates on specific call to actions. And these conversion rates include how many people are clicking on your product page or your sales page or your sign up page from your blog post. So here, you're gonna wanna pay close attention to those posts that are driving the most sales and which calls to action are performing the best. Tracking these metrics is gonna make it easier when it comes to making informed decisions from choosing which post to actually promote to understanding where to tweak call to actions or add lead magnets. So it's important to understand that the more data that you have is the more you're gonna be able to refine each stage of the funnel to create maximum conversions. Okay. So by following a step by step system within each blog post, by planning your content with both engagement and sales in mind and creating a system that captures leads and also adding a follow-up process and tracking your metrics every stage, you can then create a balanced authentic funnel that's able to align with your values and serve your readers' needs.\
\
Jeannette Spencer [00:29:42]:\
Now I do have a special free resource that I wanna share with you. So if you do want a deeper dive into setting up funnels, be sure to check out my ebook which is called the ultimate guide to building profitable sales funnels. So in this guide, you're gonna learn everything that you need to create a successful funnel in less than a week without spending a dime. And if combined with your blog, this resource is the perfect blueprint to help you build an effective blog funnel and actually drive your success. Now I'd like to thank you all for joining me today. I hope you're feeling inspired and empowered to start building your own authentic, effective sales funnel. Remember building a sales funnel isn't about compromising your authenticity. It's about finding the perfect blend of value and strategy to create lasting meaningful connections with your audience.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. Today, we're here with Jennifer Dawn who's going to be talking about mindset, and I'm so excited about this session. Jennifer, thank you so much for for doing this and being part of the summit. I greatly appreciate it.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:00:11]:\
You are so welcome. I'm excited to be here and mindset is like my all time favorite topic. So it's I love talking about it. So I'm honored to be here. Yes. Because I mean, I've been blogging\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:21]:\
for over 5 years, which sounds crazy to me. And I can even, you know, I I can look back and see when mindset shifts help me push further. And I can even look down. I'm like, I'm making my sessions and how I look at my business this year. I can tell. as and I so I'm just excited to dig into this because one of those things that just feel like the tiniest things some times that will shift in perspective or that recognition of a fear can make such a difference. Yeah. So do you wanna give us before we dive in, can you give us a little bit about your background and just sort of touch on what we're gonna cover today?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:00:55]:\
Sure. Absolutely. And so, let's see, I started my first company when I was eight years old, and I had an apple stand outside my grandfather's chiropractic office. I bought an lemonade stand was, like, so old school, and I was like, I'm not doing that. And so but I remember being eight years old and just it it was always it was such, was such a wonderful feeling to me to have an idea because my grandfather's office had patients coming in and out an apple tree right in the front yard and I was like, I'm gonna sell all those patients apples and I did. because I think, I think my grandmother had made the comment how there's so many apples going to waste on the ground. And I was just like, oh, well, I can go out pick up the good ones and sell them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:34]:\
doctor's office, an apple a day.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:01:36]:\
Right? Right. Exactly. Right. Like, how it was really my most perfect business. If I could go back and just have that It would be it would be awesome, but I just remember like holding those shiny quarters in my hand and being so just enthralled with the idea that I had an idea and I turned it into money. And then with that money, I could go do things. And so, I think that's where I really just kinda got that entrepreneurial spirit. And so, I've grown two 7 figure businesses. I'm actually on track for my 3rd right now. I was in software with my other 2 companies and with this company now, I'm a coach. I'm a whole life business coach, and I am also the founder of best planner ever, best journal ever, an author. And so that's me. And, I guess my favorite thing is that the business that I have right now is is aside from the Apple stand is absolutely my favorite business that I created this business in a completely different mindset and So I can look back at the way I I created my first two companies and how I've created this company and just like the differences are are so truly significant and really mindset is at the core of all of it. Mhmm.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:47]:\
Yeah. No. I'm excited. So do you wanna give us, like, touch on the highlights of what you wanna cover in your session today so we can -- Yeah.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:02:55]:\
Absolutely. So some things I'd love to touch on, when we talk about mindset, mindset's a very general word, and that can include a lot of different things. And so I'd love to touch on what to do when you're feeling stuck. You know, if you have something that you've been working on, even if it's been like 6 months a year or more and you haven't seen forward was progress with it, like how to get your mindset into a place, how to shift out of that, and how to start getting that forward momentum going again. if you're if you're just getting started and it's all feeling like super overwhelming, I'd love to sit and, you know, love to talk a little bit about just overwhelm itself and how to step out of it. that again is another tool in your toolbox when you're feeling overwhelmed because any entrepreneur, blogger, anybody out there trying to make their own way is gonna experience overwhelm and you need to know, you need to be prepared for it. You need to know how to get out of it. So I'd love to shift on that. I'd love just to talk about that a little bit. And, let's see. Oh, and then another thing I'd love to touch on is up leveling. So, like, you've gotten to a certain spot and you're just like, how in the world do I get to the next spot? I just seem to be kind of stagnant or stuck, you know, like, where I'm at, and I seem to break through to that next level. Love to talk about how to do that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:06]:\
Okay. Yes. I'm excited for all those things because feel like they all really apply to blogging. Uh-huh. Especially because, I mean, especially if you're you're here at the summit, you're probably taking in so much information. and there's there's it's there's such great actionable sessions that you probably have a to do list a mile long, and and hopefully the system sessions will help you with that, but can also feel overwhelming, and we don't want want that. So, I'm gonna let you take over and kinda kick it off, and and I'm gonna just pop in with questions.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:04:38]:\
Okay. So let's talk about, let's let's start at the very beginning. So let's just say that you are, just starting. And it probably seems a little overwhelming, and you're you're getting all of this information. And maybe you don't have an audience. You don't have a community yet. You don't have a following. You might even be feeling like everybody else is already so far ahead of me. Like, what's the point of even starting? I'm sure that, you know, I know I have felt that before sometimes when I've started something new and it's just like, oh my gosh, you start seeing what everybody else is doing and they're so far ahead. that is just like, ah, I just feel like I I don't even know where to begin. So again, we're gonna tie this back to mindset. And so where do you begin? And so one of the places that I like to begin is always with some type, and this is this may or may not be anything you've ever heard of for, but I call it a clearing statement. And so with the clearing statement, it's basically a statement of intention, and the idea behind it is to clear my path of wherever I want to go. And so what would I be clearing my path? So in your path could be things like limiting beliefs, know, everybody else is so far ahead of me. I'm never gonna be able to catch up. Like, that right there is a limiting belief. If you're saying to yourself, gosh, I don't really think that I have anything to offer. Right? Or what do I\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:58]:\
really know?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:05:59]:\
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who would be listening to me? Again, all of the things are just limiting beliefs. I don't have I don't know what to do. I really don't know what the next steps are. That's a little bit of a lie. That's kind of baloney. It's like, yeah, you you kinda do know what do. You may just not know what to do it, what what to do. So we wanna clear any limiting beliefs. We wanna clear any lies that we picked up We wanna clear any fears that we might be feeling. I always like to clear anything that's stopping me from changing. Mhmm. Because If you want something different to come into your life or you wanna get to that next level, you've gotta be willing to change. Everything can stay the same. Right? If it's gonna change, you have to be willing to change. And so I like to clear anything that's stopping me from making any change. I like to clear any judgments around it. Like, any of this kind of gunk. Okay? And so I always start with a clearing statement. And, again, it's just an attention statement that says, I release, I clear. You can use whatever word you want. I use clear release and let go a lot. I don't know why those word words work for me, but I just clear release and let go. Anything blocking my progress, anything stopping me, any place where I'm not aware. Any information that I'm choosing not to see, you know, any fear around getting to the next level. Just wanna set my intention to clear clear clear, release, and let all of that go. So that's one of the first things that I like to do is just sort of clear the path. Now if you are really struggling with a lot of negative emotion around it. And let's face it. You know, a lot of us, have been through some junk, you know, the reasons why you're gonna start blogging, Who knows? So if you're struggling with a lot of negative emotion, one of the things I do suggest here is that you actually journal it out. And I know, like, people listening like, oh god. Like, I don't wanna draw it out. Okay. But I use a different journaling exercise. And so with the journaling exercise. And this is actually what, sparked me to create my best journal ever was because I found this to be so powerful and so effective when we talk about shifting your mindset. Okay? You've got this huge, like, obstacle you're trying to get through. And so any emotion that you're feeling around it, 15, 20 minutes, just journal it out. Like, however you're feeling, you can say whatever you need to say, you're scared, if you're angry, if whatever it happens to be, but you just wanna journal all that stuff out. Yep. But then you take the pages and you rip them up and you throw them away. Right? This is not a journal anybody ever comes back to read including yourself. And that's part of what makes it so powerful is because if you know, nobody's gonna come back and read it. It sort of opens the door for you to go where you need to go to purge all that junk out. And and and I'm kind of overlapping a little bit here because the journaling will work for overwhelmed too. It will work for exhaustion, frustration, any emotion that you're feeling, how\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:52]:\
-- -- of getting it out.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:08:54]:\
Exactly. And that exercise is so good. And what I noticed is that if I set the timer for 20 minutes and I just, like, go to town, blah blah blah. What will happen is I'll kinda clear through that layer of gunk, and I'll notice it'll start to get information. I'll start to get clarity. I'll start to learn a lesson. I'll start to reconnect with my gratitude. Like, those good, positive mindset things that it's just hard to put ourselves in. That journaling exercise will really, really help me do that. And so If you're struggling with any sort of negative emotion, oh my gosh, you're bloggers. If you're having writer's block, even if you're just like so mad because you're just like, I don't know what to write. I journal that out and just be like, I'm so mad. I don't know what to write. And then just keep writing and keep writing push through it, and you'll feel it release once you kinda get through that gunk. And then it's like the gates of having opening. You're like, woah. Okay. Okay. I get it now. And then he gets to rip it up and throw it away and never look at it again, and you don't have to go to therapy or anything.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:02]:\
or burning in the fire pit outside.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:10:04]:\
Burn it in the fire pit. You know, I rip it up and I put it in the dumpster, like, whatever is. Read it\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:10]:\
if you want. You know? Yeah. But that's\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:10:12]:\
the power. Yeah. Is knowing nobody's ever gonna see it. That's what really gives you that permission to go wherever you need to go, then you can let that stuff out. And then from there, that's where you're gonna start to get more clarity and focus and and all of those good, positive mindset attributes that you're gonna need to be successful.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:30]:\
Yeah. And I think when you're having to put it out, right, it kind of forces you to take a step back. and look at what are those things that are holding you back or, like I said, a limiting belief, or maybe it's just a belief could be sometimes a belief system that you were kind of brought up in that really doesn't apply to how you're living your life or something, but it's just something you've never even thought about being -- That's right. -- could be different.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:10:52]:\
That's right. Exactly. No. Because ultimately, you know, it's kind of it's the beginning of a new year, and so many people, like, give resolutions, like, a bad wrap. and I don't like that because I'm like resolutions work if 2 things happen. 1, your mindset shifts. You know, you start thinking differently. and 2, your behaviors shift. You start behaving differently. If you shift your thinking and you shift your behaviors, you can meet any real resolution that you set. It's when you set a resolution and then you just stay in the same thinking space and doing space that of course it's not gonna work. doesn't matter what time of year it is. So, you know, here we are at the beginning of a year. And if you're just like, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna blog this many times a or whatever times a week. You know, I'm gonna get my community, my following up to this many. You can totally do it, but only if you shift your thinking and you if your behaviors, that's how you're gonna be able to get there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:48]:\
Yeah. No. I like that a lot. because, yeah, it's it's and What I found in my experience is sometimes it's the tiniest shift that just starts the, like, you know, rolling the ball that I'm, you know, all of a sudden I'm moving forward. And I feel like there it is spurts, right, where I'm like, Hoosh. And then I stuck And I'm like, wait. What happens? You know? So so maybe we could talk about kind of when you hit those plataus or when you get stuck and you're just like, wait a second. I was doing so good. What happened? Right.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:12:21]:\
Exactly. I love it. I love it. and it's interesting because we wanna talk about comfort zone. Right? So you're in your comfort zone. Things are going along really nice, and you're just like, yahoo. Here we go. And you're doing everything you need to do, and it's working and you're like, great. Okay. And so you kinda and then you hit this plateau where you're just like, wait, what a second? Because you're in a comfort zone. and I like to think of it as it's like, wait a second. When my comfort zone is up leveling, which is what you wanna do, It's going to be uncomfortable. That's why we're out of the comfort zone, and we have to get out of our comfort zone. Yeah. And so often what I've seen in the work I've done with my clients is that they'll do really good and things start happening. And one of 2 things will happen either they will start making decisions which will put them back into their old comfort zone of what they're used to, or they're in their comfort zone and they don't wanna change the mindset and the behaviors that require you to go from this this place to the next place because it will require change. And so whenever I'm going through one of those up leveling, now I've just kinda learned to recognize it. It's like, okay. Wait a second. I'm just in this comfort zone. I need to get to the next comfort zone. So let me clear anything that might be in my way. First of all, any beliefs? What am I telling myself? What's that self taught? me clear all clear all that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:44]:\
-- your success because I feel like your failures talked a lot about, but not fear of success, which\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:13:49]:\
your fear of success is huge. Yeah. So I'm afraid of success, whatever that happens to be, if I need to journal it out, okay, I'm gonna journal it out, I'm gonna get that stuff cleared, and then I'm gonna start asking like, well, what's it gonna take for me to get to the next level? And when I start getting that in that information of, well, you need to do this. You need to do this, which is gonna require me to think differently and behave a little differently, then I just gradually kind of ease myself into it and start just up leveling, up leveling, and now I might be a little uncomfortable. but in my own mind, I'll just think of it sounds kinda weird, but I think of a grid filling in. And so like, it's like, hey, wait. I've decided in my grid that I wanna go up here, and so I'm gonna think differently, behave differently, become the person that I need to be to be up here. Mhmm. And then I need to let that grid kind of fill in. And it's sort of just like a feeling. I don't know how to explain it, but -- No. No. You're great\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:\
because I it's, like, I've started recognizing it as well where I'm like, okay. It's something I don't wanna do.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:14:50]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:50]:\
It's probably something I need to do. gonna make me uncomfortable. It's gonna push me forward. And I had that when I was putting together the summit where I was like, these are my dream speakers. And I was like, that's a dream. But I was like, no. You to pitch them because you're scared. The the fact that you -- Right. -- for half a second were like, I don't want to means you absolutely have to. And and I did. I pitched all of them, and I some nos, right, but I also got some yeses, which totally I was like, you know, like, I'm so thrilled that the speakers who've gotten to the summit yourself included, and I'm, like, so glad that even when I was, like, in doubt, I pushed through when I pitched it anyway because --\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:15:25]:\
That's right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:26]:\
That's right. You know, it's it's created something that I'm, like, super excited about.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:15:30]:\
Right. But you had to be willing to think about it a little differently. Like, you know what? I'm not gonna let this stop me, and then you had to take You had to just go pitch them anyway. You had to be willing to get the nos to get to the yeses. Yeah. And that's how we up level. And it is a little comfortable and fear will pop up. And I I like you, I'm just like, anytime I'm afraid of something, I'm always like, wait a second. Am I afraid of this because it's gonna really help me get to where I wanna be, or am I feeling nervous on this? -- hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:01]:\
Or and sometimes I'm like, am\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:16:02]:\
I feeling fear around this because it's not the right direction? So I will definitely\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:07]:\
-- You know, you're like, you know what? No. I don't wanna go that way, but, you know, in that case, it was a I'm scared they'll say no. I'm like, well, then they say no, but what -- Right. Exactly. Yes. Right?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:16:16]:\
Like, it definitely, like, I have to go for it. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:18]:\
It's like, if the worst thing happened is they say no and maybe block my email if I'm really that annoying.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:16:24]:\
Like -- Right. Right. Exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:26]:\
Keep pitching. Keep following up until you actually get to know.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:16:29]:\
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I think you have to put it out there. And, you know, especially with writing, you know, you're Sometimes you're pouring your your thoughts, your opinions, your heart, your soul out there for the world. And, you know, the world may not always agree and may not like it and you might get a little criticism. You might get some pushback and, you know, to me, I'm like, if people are taking the time to complain, it means that I somehow got their attention. Yes. Right? And in this whole\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:59]:\
-- Like, if you get, like, a hater comment, or that means you've made it. That means, like, you have engaged people enough that they care enough to say something even if they don't agree with you,\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:17:10]:\
I\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:28]:\
wanted someone subscribed to my email list just so they could get my email to send me a 800 word email about how much they disagreed with the post I wrote. Oh. And I was like, well, you cannot subscribe. And I was like, yes. Like, you cared that much. So so be glad for the haters too. That's right. But, again, you\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:17:29]:\
know what? That's a mindset shift where you're just like, hey. They're hating me. I'm I'm getting on some radars, I must be doing something right. Yeah. Yeah. And if they're copying you too, that you must be doing something right. I've seen that before where I'll see some of my stuff out there and I'm like, hey, but then it's like, wait a second. if they if they're resonating with it, if they like what you're doing enough, you're just gonna have people kind of\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:52]:\
I mean, there's a fine line there. Go watch the legal sessions having to do with this summit we've got. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. There's a there's a where they, you know, there's there's the popping you where they reference you and they're like, this person's amazing, and I wanna be like, and then there's, like, straight up copying.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:18:08]:\
Straight up copy.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:07]:\
That is, like, not okay. And that there's things you can do to protect your intellectual property, all that stuff. So -- Right. You know, there's some flattery, but there's some also, like, no, not cool.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:18:20]:\
So -- Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. But again, it's all depending on when you look at it and how you handle it. And so I love that you mentioned you know, look at the legal stuff, look at how to protect yourself. Again, it's all mindset stuff. It's like not being a victim to it. If it happens, hopefully, it won't. and just be being willing to protect yourself. Feel being willing to take those steps. So I love that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:41]:\
Yeah. Yeah. so I love your journaling suggestion in terms of breaking through those barriers. do you have any kind of exercises or suggestions of how does sort of recognize what those fears are where, you know, like, yes, you can get a journal and you're like, I'm, you know, you can always be like, I'm just, I don't know what to write. I struggle. I never come up with good ideas, but usually there's a deeper level that you have to get to to really bust out of that that it's it's more than just writers block.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:19:12]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:12]:\
Yeah. You know, the it is a fear of something.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:19:15]:\
Right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:15]:\
How do you work into recognizing specifically what those fears are?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:19:19]:\
Yeah. Great question. And so the first thing that I would say is, 1, you have to set your intention. You have to want to know what those peers are. And I say that because so many of us will distract ourselves from really knowing and understanding what's going on. So it might scare us to get in there. It might scare us to feel what we're really feeling. And so we'll just kind of numb and dumb ourselves down. Right? We check out. We go and watch a bunch of TV. We get lost in social media. we might drink. We might do things like that that are kind of like numbing it all down and because we're not really willing to look at it. And so the first thing that I would say is, 1, set your intention to really want to get in there, want to know what's happening, be brave. I promise nobody ever died from an emotion. They didn't. and you'll find that once you get in there and you start to actually feel this stop and acknowledge its existence, it will go away on its own. instead of, you know, bearing it, repressing it, and it's still kind of staying stuck to you. Yeah. But if you acknowledge it, it's gonna actually go away on its own. It's gonna feel really good because often our emotions are telling us something. It's usually some sort of information. you're afraid of something. Well, why? Like, get in there. Why am I afraid of this? Well, maybe because you know, I failed at it before. Okay. Well, what am I doing differently this time to make sure I don't fail again? And so you can kind of work through that. But, you know, with the journaling is so powerful because I've noticed that the more I do it, the deeper I go. But if I'm setting my intention to kinda get in there and figure it out. That's sort of the first step is being willing to look at it. stop choosing to be unaware of what's going on. Okay. And then the journaling exercise is just really, really crucial to just just start free flowing it out. Sometimes I'm, like, sitting there writing and it's just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, because it'll just sort of break open. And I'm like, that's what's going on. And I I really need to just sit and think about it all day. Wouldn't necessarily be of allowed me to break it open the way that sometimes just I don't know, pen to paper. It just will kind of really just sort of break that down, but, like, you can't do it once and be like, oh, my problems are solved. Like, it doesn't work that way.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:34]:\
Like, it's -- -- rise. Like, new levels, new problems.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:18:19]:\
Yeah. It's kind of like a daily thing that you just sort of bring into your day the same way you might bring in meditation or visualization, bring in a little bit of journaling. You just sort of bring that into your day with the intention of clearing it, getting rid of it, understanding it, learning from it and using it to propel you forward.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:57]:\
Yeah. Yeah. No. I I I like that a lot because I found, like, fear failure doesn't seem to bother me because I fail all the time. I've gotten really good at failing, you know, like, like, throughout my life. you know, but what I've learned you know, in the last couple of years, I actually did have a fear of success because I would go go go be really close to our own to be and then be like, I'm gonna go work on something else now. you know, and just, like, feel like, well, so close. You know?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:22:24]:\
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:24]:\
And, you know, so I think it is something that, you know, you really do have to decide you wanna focus and recognize regardless of what you're gonna find.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:22:32]:\
Yep. Yep. Absolutely.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:33]:\
Yeah. And if there's a fear of what you'll find.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:22:35]:\
Sure. Often that fear of success and it's very valid, very legitimate. I think most people have a fear of success and failure, but with the fear of success also is tied to that fear of change.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:45]:\
Yeah.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:22:46]:\
Because when you're more successful, your life will change. Your circumstances will change, and it's kind of the unknown because you're you know what today is, what your life is, Yep. If you start to become more successful, it's the unknown. Like, it's not a road you've been on. So it's that fear of change and what if I don't like it and all of that stuff starts to get kinda tied together.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:55]:\
Yeah. And you say it, you know, like, going into the unknown, I'm like, there's that frozen two song. And I\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:23:14]:\
Yes. Yeah. Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:11]:\
So we've we've talked about kind of feeling stuck in the forward momentum and, and kind of that breaking through the barriers to uplevel, but how do you how and you touched on journaling for overwhelm, but how do you kind of tackle that? Because once you get it all out, I feel like sometimes in that instance, I wouldn't wanna tear it up because I need to reference it, like, all the things I wanted to do with a plan. So, like -- Yeah.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:23:35]:\
Yeah. Exactly. And actually in my journal, I have space where the pages they're designed to be torn out, but I have pages in the front or for the stuff I wanna keep. Because as I'm journaling, sometimes there are thoughts or or whatever ideas that I'm like, oh, I need to hold on to that. So I will write that down in a separate space and keep that. And and that way I can still rip up and throw away the rest. But with overwhelm, whether you're starting out, you're up leveling or you're you're up leveled and you're just like, oh my god, this feels like drinking from the fire hose. wherever you happen to be, one of my favorite exercises to do to combat combat overwhelm is, a brain dump, which is nothing new. Okay. But this part 2, that's, like, that's the good part. So the first thing that you wanna do is just look at everything that you've got going on. When overwhelmed is kinda like not knowing what to do next because or feeling like, you know, whatever I do, I'm gonna be disappointing somebody like, and you just kinda get frozen. And so -- Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:31]:\
--\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:24:31]:\
some people, when they're just super overwhelmed, will just start doing whatever, just to cross things off the list, some people will just completely check out and just be like, I have no idea. So I'm gonna go over here and watch Netflix like whatever. So whatever you are in that What I recommend is that you first brain dump it out. So personal and professional, everything that's going on, just write it all down on a big massive list. but you cannot stop there, or you just have a big overwhelming massive list. Yeah. But at least you're getting it out of your head and you're getting it onto paper\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:00]:\
Because then you're not trying to, like, think compartmentalize and remember all the things and then something inevitably gets forgotten, and it's just yeah.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:25:08]:\
Right. Exactly. But, I mean, personal and professional, like, I put it on there, all my obligations down to the last little minute detail, everything that I'm kind of like feeling like, oh my gosh. I have all this stuff to do. then I go through and I a, b, c, d, e it. So an a is gonna be something that I do that will actually push me forward And it might be one of those tasks like going and pitching speakers for your blogging summit. Okay? Yeah. That's an a. It might scare you. You might you'll wanna procrastinate it totally, but you know in your heart, that will get you closer to where you wanna be. Right? So that's an a. and everything can't be an a. Usually won't, but usually it's kind of like, oh, it's something I know I should be doing, but I'm kind of procrastinating there's some fear around it, but Those are my a's. Yeah. B's are gonna be the important things we all have to do. You know, vendor meetings, client meetings, whatever we have to do. Those are the b's. They're important. C's, we can delegate until later. So they're really not that important. And if you've ever been in a state of overwhelm or maybe just how you run your day to day, if you're a list person and you like to make a list and cross things off, right? Sometimes you'll find yourself doing a lot of C tasks. They're not really that important. but they're easy to cross off a list. And so when I really started diving into my productivity, I started looking at all my lists and going, oh, there was not an A on that list. The b's were done, and I got a bunch of c's done so I could cross them off. And I'm like, uh-uh, that's not gonna work. And so I flipped it, right? Because scenes can be procrastinated. So when you look at this massive brain dump, These things can wait, and so those are all your c's. D's are delegate. Who can we assign, get some help around, you know, whatever the delegation is, and e is eliminate. And eliminate could be forever or it could be not right now. So it might be like, you know what? I'm gonna move this to next quarter. I'm gonna move this to next year. or I'm just gonna eliminate it from the list right now because it's not a high priority and it's not really moving me to where I wanna be. So now once you've got this massive list, ABCDE, you kind of have a tangible, like, oh, okay. So now every day, try and knock out 1 or 2 A's. Mhmm. Get your b's done. C's as you're able. Everything that you're delegating. Make sure you're coming back and checking sure, you know, whenever you get that stuff done. And if you can clear some of that stuff off and eliminate it or move it later, that's gonna open up some space. So it's a simple exercise, but if you're really overwhelmed, like, getting it all down, creating a a kind of a map around it and a strategy can be so effective. And you might have to do this, like, every day for a few days until you start feeling like, okay, I'm really caught up. I've got\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:44]:\
feelings around it. Yeah. Like, in my head, I'm like, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. I need to I need to break down, and I need to go through this.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:27:44]:\
Yes. Exactly. And, you know, it might take half hour. It might take an hour, but If it gets all your productivity going back in the right direction, it's worth the time. Just put your ass in the chair and do it. And now It's like, oh, okay. I can do this. I'm and you you don't need to knock out 12 A's in a day. Knock out 1 a a day, you know, one big thing gonna move you forward, your b's, and your c's as you're able until you start feeling more caught up.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:17]:\
Yeah. No. I think, yeah, that's just Yeah. Not really. I need to do try this. I'll I really like that ABCDE just -- --\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:28:28]:\
thousands of people. Every person I've ever worked with, and I'm like, I'm overwhelmed. It's like, okay. Do this. And if you do it, it will work. and it does. And people are like, oh my gosh. That just oh, oh, freed me up so much.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:16]:\
And -- -- the perspective shift of how you're looking at the things you're doing, and it and it's a very clear way to do it. I I never liked that. yeah. So okay. So we I'm trying to look at what else we had to talk about. Oh, one thing, because you did touch on this. I'd love to dive just a little bit deeper -- Mhmm. -- is the comparison game. Oh, that's to stop. You have to stop Well, yeah, but it's it's hard. Especially in blogging, especially if you know you started around the same time as someone. Maybe you both got the say, of course, and you're like, okay. We started this course around the same time, and they just take off. And you're like, but, yeah, what am I doing? You know, so, like, how do you deal with that? How do you kind of because I think comparing in some ways can be good because it can help you be like, hey. What are they doing that I'm not that can help me? You know, it can give you ideas, but it can also, like, put you in such a negative place.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:29:32]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:32]:\
Yeah. I can. You know, advice or tips on dealing with that.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:29:30]:\
Yeah. I love this. And so it's funny because I had gotten, a book. It's I haven't it's on my bookshelf with some. It's Brendan Bouchard. Okay. Brendan Bouchard is ridiculous, and he huge. And he's like, you know, helped a billion people or whatever the number is. And I got his book about the the productivity habits or whatever. I was like, man, he's doing so many good things in this world. Let me read this book. So I opened the book and I start reading it, and it's all about all his accomplishments. And I was like, oh, I just started shrinking, and I just started feeling so bad about my self. And I was like, I can't read this book. I was like, this book is making me feel terrible about myself because that's what I was doing. I was comparing myself to where I\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:18]:\
have -- Like, every time you read the blog income reports.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:30:18]:\
Yeah. Exactly. And you're just like, oh my god. And I still haven't read I'm gonna read it one day, but I'm sure there's some great information in there. Sorry, Brendan. I'm sure it's wonderful. but I couldn't get through it because, it really the way that it was written or something, it just really made me feel bad about myself and didn't feel inspiring like, hey, I did this and you can get here too. And maybe that was chapter too. I don't know. I didn't get that far. Yeah. But, it was, again, it's that comparison where I started to compare myself. And so this can happen to any of us. Mhmm. And so, really, the first thing I would suggest is that you whatever it is that you're eating or doing or whatever step away from it. Just get a little bit of perspective. It's really okay. If you feel yourself like going down that hole and you're just really feeling bad and now you're starting to feel bad about yourself and you're starting to internalize it. Of course, you could journal about it, but I want you to get a little bit of distance from it because every person who's accomplished anything and they built this community and their blogs are taking off or whatever, they all started from nothing to. They did. Like, nobody started with a super successful blog. Like, they all had to start a ground 0 and write their first one and, you know, they all had to start in the same place. Yeah. And so you can absolutely do absolutely do that too. But, again, if you're in that mindset of, oh, you know, I'm not as good as him or whatever, you know, it will never happen. So distance yourself, give yourself a little space from it because you are uniquely you. And I think you have to own you and what you're gonna provide because you're gonna say it in your way. You're gonna do it in your way. and the people who are gonna follow you will follow you, but they're not gonna follow you if you're kinda caught up in all of this, like, trying to be somebody else.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:13]:\
You know? Yeah. I've done where, like, I've stopped following or blocked, like, people on social, like, other bloggers on social, not because, like, I didn't like them, but because somehow what they were doing made me feel like, you know, kinda shrunk me, like, maybe in you. And I was like, It's not on them. Like, they're not doing this. It's my feelings. Right? But I just need to step away and not see what they're doing for a while. Right. Exactly. Who knows of them for all their success. Like, great job. I need to, like, not follow you because it's just making me struggle in ways that I don't need to.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:32:11]:\
Exactly. And if it's kill in your mindset, like, it's not worth it. And then another great way to flip it is to send that person love and blessings and goodwill and congratulations and gratitude because they've actually shown that you could do it. Like, if they can do it, you can do it. They've shown that there's an audience for whatever the topic might be, like, oh, people do care about this. And so if you can start to shift it with some gratitude and even just love them, bless them, be happy for them. And sometimes it's hard. Yeah. But, like, you know, just think about it for a little while. and and that will help you shift into your own space. Yep. And then you can focus on building what you love and what you want. and bringing those people that will really appreciate what you have to say and focus on that instead of, you know, the comparison game.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:33:37]:\
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and it's okay to, like, step back and turn off social or turn or stop following them. You know? Like, If they're they're in a place where you wanna be, like, them having one less follower is not gonna, like, make or break them. Like, you know? No. And it's okay because you can always later go call them again when you're like, hey. I'm, you know --\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:33:57]:\
Right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:33:57]:\
-- and that's fine. You know? It's -- Right. It's okay. And if someone actually says something to you because maybe you do have some sort of personal relationship be like, hey. Kudos to you on all your success. I just need to step back so I could focus on my own stuff, and I wanted to follow less people for right now. Like, absolutely. It's don't apologize. You don't need to apologize for doing things like that. You just need to tell them why if you want, although you don't owe them an explanation either.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:33:35]:\
That's right. That's right. I mean, I have a a daily planner. Like, I don't know if anybody shops for one lately, but there's about a million options these days, and so many people have their own planners. And the competition is really, really fierce. And if I let that stop me, I would never have probably released it, but I built my own community one person at a time. And I'm just like, you know, for the people that this is a good fit for, it's a good fit for. but, like, I've gotten caught into that trap of looking, Brendan Bouchard has a planner. You know, everybody has a planner, and I might, like, go and peek and see a little bit but I don't wanna I also don't want a copy. I wanna do what I feel inspired to do.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:34:58]:\
I feel inspired to do.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:34:59]:\
So I might go look a little bit, but then I just cut it off. And I'm like, God love them. God bless them. Whatever. I'm like, let them go do what they need to do. And I really hope they're successful, and they help Stapleton, and I'm gonna be over here, and I'm gonna do what I need to do, let me be successful, and let me help people too. because because\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:35:16]:\
and also just try to help people out there that use multiple planners. So they might use yours and Brendan's, and, you know, because they have different things going on. because it's for them keeping that that much organized, but, you know, there are people that have, like, you use the 5 different plan or the like.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:35:31]:\
Oh, I know.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:35:32]:\
I I can't do that, but great. If that works for you, if that's how your brain works. Awesome. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So Okay. was there anything we hadn't touched on that you wanted to make sure we covered?\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:35:45]:\
you know, the only other final thought about overwhelm, I'm gonna swing back here. Yeah. Oh, overwhelm is also a belief. And when we talk about your core belief system of who you are and what you believe, if you believe that, you know, a busy blogger is overwhelmed, then that's what you're gonna be. And so just spend a few minutes really thinking about, like, what belief do I have around overwhelm? And if you don't wanna be overwhelmed anymore, you can change that belief system. You can do the brain dump. You can get yourself organized and you can commit to not gonna work in an overwhelmed state. And anytime you start to feel it, now you have a tool, you know, what to do to to study Yeah. And you can change your belief system and just commit to a different way of working. and that can be really, really powerful.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:34:58]:\
Oh, yeah. I because I especially with blogging, is there's always more you could do? Like, 100%. You could work all the time. But but that's not good in for most people, not for me. It's not good for me to, like, never hang out with friends or family. or whatever, you know, because I'm constantly working. And so setting boundaries and me like, nope. I'm gonna be done at this time, or I'm only doing, you know, I'm taking a day off where I don't even cracked my laptop open.\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:36:58]:\
Exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:36:57]:\
You know, because I just need that break, but for my mental sanity. You know, so don't feel bad about that. if that means the post is a day late or you have to backdate the republish or whatever, you know, maybe you just maybe instead of writing new posts, you've republish an old one that you update 10 minutes. Right. If that's okay. Right. Right. And you make such\
\
Jennifer Dawn [00:37:19]:\
a great comment about, like, don't feel bad about that. Sometimes it's hard not to feel bad about like, you're like, oh, I'm not if I'm not at my desk, then, I'm not gonna be as successful. Again, bad belief, limiting belief, clear that out. Like, replace it with, I can work a reasonable day and still have a whole life and still be successful. So it all kinda ties there. And in the in the beginning, if you cut off work and you're like, oh, I feel guilty. It will be uncomfortable. Right? because you're out of your comfort zone. but you just have to realign with, wait, what do I firm? What do I want? I I don't wanna work a 12 hour day. I wanna work a reasonable day and see my family at night and just kind of reaffirm that. Even if it feels a little uncomfortable at the beginning, if it's getting you closer to where you wanna be, even if it's a little uncomfortable, do it. Just, yeah, just push through that.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. Thank you for joining me and Jessie on a journey for this session. I'm super excited. We kinda twin-ed and we didn't even mean to. so, Jessie, thank you for for agreeing to do this. I'm super pumped to learn from you today.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:00:14]:\
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:16]:\
Yeah. So, you know, you're a travel blogger, which is I always, like, envy a little bit because I do not get to travel nearly as much as I want to. and you're based in New York, which is also pretty awesome.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:00:29]:\
How do\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:30]:\
I what I kind of love about your site too is you're not, like, only on the go as you you do your trips and stuff, but you've been blogging since 2011. It's been at it a long time and today we're gonna be talking about how to grow and nurture a community. so why don't you kind of give us the highlights of of your thoughts on this topic and then we'll dive in with some questions\
\
Jessie Festa [00:00:53]:\
Yeah. So I have, you know, a lot of students and a lot of bloggers in my community, people who are trying to create their own location independent businesses travel more while also earning an income. And the one thing I see a lot that I would consider a big mistake is especially with travelers because they're writing about their trips. They're very me, me, me. Oh, I did this. I I did that. And, a, they're not really thinking about how those posts will benefit somebody else or even what they will lead to in terms of benefits. Like, they're writing about their trip, but they're not thinking about, okay, how is this going to grow my social media following my email list, get me sales, get me affiliate clicks. They're sort of just trying to create content and hope that it goes somewhere. so that's one big mistake. And then the other big mistake tying back to not really having an idea of how your content will benefit somebody else is I see a lot of travel bloggers specifically because that's my audience, but just bloggers in general the same, not having a mission, not having a thing that they're trying to achieve or a way that they're trying to help a community. So those are a few things I think are important to consider when you are starting a blog of any niche if you want to grow a community. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:12]:\
And and a community is important because those are the people that are gonna make your blog a business, really. And in\
\
Jessie Festa [00:02:20]:\
the travel blogging space, it's interesting because maybe some a bit in the lifestyle space too, but press trips and working with brands is really big for travel bloggers. And it's also a big way I make money as well. But I think a lot of bloggers starting out but also intermediate are really focused on, oh, I wanna work with brands. Oh, I wanna have this Instagram following. when I actually feel like the more sustainable way is to build the community and then work with the brands that benefit the community, create products that benefit the community, work with affiliates that benefit the community. And I'll type just, yeah, tie everything back to that. Absolutely. And, like, sponsors and, and, you know, affiliates, they're gonna wanna work with you because you\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:01]:\
have engaged, audience. Exactly. -- engagement that matters, not necessarily the numbers. It's kinda like people chasing traffic for display ad revenue, which is like, yeah, you can make money that way, but you're not gonna build a business on typically. Yeah. which so I left. So you have been blogging a long time. So out of curiosity, did growing a community come quickly for you, or was that sort of you made some of those same mistakes? And then, like, how did that?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:03:29]:\
so many mistakes, but I would say in 2011, the, like, the landscape of blogging was so different. getting paid to work with brands and specifically for travel bloggers, getting paid to go on press trips was unheard of. even like the idea of creating products, like, that kinda came to me pretty quick. Mhmm. I started creating courses, I wanna say, in, like, 2012 or\
\
Jessie Festa [00:03:52]:\
13. Okay.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:03:54]:\
Just because a lot of people were asking me, oh, how are you making money on this? How do I start a blog? So I sort of saw an opportunity there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:03]:\
Yeah. Your community kind of reached out to you about those things.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:08]:\
Exactly. And I I always keep a spreadsheet still. of what people are asking me, comments, DMs, emails, all that stuff. What do people want for me? That's even I also, sell photo tours in New York City.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:20]:\
Yes. Same\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:20]:\
thing. Just so many people asking me to show them around New York. I'm like, okay. I never thought it'd be a tour guide, but Let me create something, and that's, like, a huge, huge moneymaker for me. And it's something I love too, because I know it's something that people want and enjoy. but yeah, back in 2011, I feel like it was more sort of like quick sponsored posts. I wasn't really thinking about community. I was just sort of trying to figure out what blogging was. To be honest, like, in\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:45]:\
2010,\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:47]:\
I didn't even know what a blogging was. I just knew that I loved travel, and I saw other people creating blogs once I started doing research. And I was like, oh, let me figure out this whole blog thing and see what that is. But -- Yep.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:58]:\
--\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:59]:\
like, I didn't grow up with, like I'm a millennial, but I'm the elder millennial. Yeah. Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:05:04]:\
So I\
\
Jessie Festa [00:05:04]:\
didn't grow up with social media and all that stuff. So this was all very, very new to me, like, people think, oh, you, you know, you're pretty young. You probably, like, grew up with an an iPhone and Facebook all that with. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:18]:\
Like, I watched my first YouTube video, my junior year of college.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:05:24]:\
about that, but still, like, when I started this blog, there was no Instagram. Also, like, Twitter was the biggest thing in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. It was so different.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:33]:\
Yeah. No. Totally. It's it's it's weird when you think about how much it's taken over our lives. So I was like, Yeah. Facebook started in college, and it was only colleges. And it was, you know, it was -- It was,\
\
Jessie Festa [00:05:42]:\
like, for parties and stuff. Yeah. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:45]:\
It was completely there. It was like, who's in your classes? But, yeah, so okay. So, obviously, the landscape has changed a bit. So what have over your many years of blogging is sort of what strategies have you found work well and sort of growing a community when you decide to fit that first? I think you said you start with the mission.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:06:03]:\
Yeah. So I did kinda start with a mission unintentionally. I was the solo female traveler. I basically in college plan this big backpacking trip 3 York for the summer with my some of my sorority sisters, and then I spent so much time planning this. I was so excited. And then as the trip got closer and closer and it got time to actually book the flights, everyone backed out, and I had to make that decision. Like, do I give up the hours and hours and research that I've done and the excitement that I feel, or do I just do this by myself? So I went by myself and that really, like, changed everything for me, in a good way. And now pretty much that's I'm engaged, and I still, like, usually I'm traveling by myself because my fiance is a teacher. So pretty much every month or every 2 months I go on a trip, usually solo. And when I started, I wanted to help women confidently travel solo, give them good information on how to travel solo, basically give them the resources that I had a lot of trouble finding when I was planning my trips. Yeah. So I didn't really go into it thinking like, oh, I need a mission statement. I need to help people. Yeah. But looking back on it, I'm like, oh, I'm glad that I unintentionally did have a mission. Yeah. I think it's a very good thing to have.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:14]:\
Yeah. And then once you kinda clearly figured out that that was your mission, it made it easier to create content and focus to grow your communities that you're saying.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:07:22]:\
Exactly. And it has shifted over the years because I feel like I have become more of, you know, the blogging space. I've created so many courses and freebies and I speak at conferences on blogging. So now it's very much sort of like living your best life through travel, realizing that there are other avenues for you, not just, you know, go to college, get married, do the 9 to\
\
Jessie Festa [00:07:46]:\
5,\
\
Jessie Festa [00:07:46]:\
which is nothing wrong with that at all. I think that's a great time. Yeah. But just knowing that there's other options, even like with the solo travel thing, I still have so many friends, even though they see me do it, they're like, oh, I don't know if I could do that. I'm like, You can. Trust me. Go to my website.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:01]:\
I'll -- I'm like, if I could figure it out, you could, because I was not I'm not techie.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:08:07]:\
like this, whether you're trying to travel sort of business, you wanna be more location independent. Like, I just really want people to see that Anything is possible. It's not just what you're told is what you're supposed to do. Like, there's so many other options.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:21]:\
Yeah. Absolutely. And I love that you kinda started in the, like, female solo travel. Like bloggers like you, or I went on my first solo international trip in 2018 yeah, last year, 2018, well, 2 years ago. Oh, man. Like, I'd I'd, like, studied abroad and stuff, and I technically, like, didn't know people I got there, but that's different than, like, going somewhere by yourself. you're not meeting up with, like, an arranged group or something. So and then I went again on another one last year as I'm like, hey, every year, I'm just gonna do, like, a nice little international trip by myself somewhere.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:08:53]:\
It's nice. And I feel like it does, like it helps you kinda grow your relationship with yourself. Also, you don't have to compromise your itinerary at all. You can really look pick everything that you wanna do. Just some benefits, I would say.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:04]:\
Yeah. No. I absolutely love it. it's it's fantastic. but back to, like, the blogging side of things. so once you kind of have that mission, sort of, what steps did you take to kind of implement it? Or, you know, like, what did you look at doing to, you know, reach that mission, I guess.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:09:22]:\
Yeah. So along with, listening to my audience, keeping that spreadsheet always keeping track of what people are asking me. I think it's really helpful to find some places online that your audience is hanging out, like Facebook groups and, niche Reddit forums. Probably, I don't really use Quoara, but I know a lot of other people use that and just seeing what people are asking there, what problems they have, what questions they're asking where you can kind of dig and find those problems. Yep. And that'll give you a good idea of like, okay. There's a lot of people who need help with x. Let me create some blog posts, some videos, social media content. But the thing is once you have that mission, and then you figure out some of those problems, it just becomes so much easier to know what to write. Like I know in the travel space, a lot of bloggers, you go on a trip and there's You can write about the food. You can write about the the safety aspect. You can write about the hotels. Like, there's so many options within that trip. Yeah. You have a mission. You'll just really know, like, okay, my audience is really into slow travel. They're really into responsible tourism. They're really into luxury hotels. which is known. It'll be so much easier to create a space online where you are the expert on that topic.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:34]:\
Yeah. So so quality market research really, which is not the most fun term, but that's pretty much what we're doing. Yeah. Definitely. So did was there in girl, you know, in in figuring this stuff out where there's specific strategies you tried that didn't work? Fell flat? Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:10:53]:\
I'm sure there was, like, one thing. Nothing I would say this is falling flat, but, like, we were talking about a little bit before we went live, like, growing the email list. I think it's the best thing you could do really focusing on that. I would say a mistake for me was I didn't start growing. My email is probably till, like, maybe 3 years ago is when I really started.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:12]:\
So I\
\
Jessie Festa [00:11:12]:\
missed it out on a few years of Yeah. Really. Yeah. Doing that. and I was always told you from my email list, but it didn't click for me. I'm like, well,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:21]:\
people say, oh, you need to grow a list, but they don't explain why or what you do with it. bucks.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:11:25]:\
Yeah. So I'm like, what do I do? Just, like, share links to my blog post. I could do that on Facebook. So I just, like, didn't get it. But, One thing I'll say when I first learned about the whole, like create something free to get people on your list and you can nurture them. I thought it had to be the most complex, crazy thing ever that I would have to create. I created, like, so many really complicated things that took me a long time and didn't even convert that well. My best converting opt in is a PDF. It's a list of influencer networks for travel bloggers took me a day or\
\
Jessie Festa [00:12:00]:\
2\
\
Jessie Festa [00:12:01]:\
to create. And by far, it's still my best option. And I'm like, oh, wow. Sometimes, like, The most effective thing isn't the most complicated. It's just the thing that people really want.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:\
Yeah. Yeah. Simple. oftentimes wins out over an complication.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:12:15]:\
Yeah. It's like a quick win. Like, it's a list they can read really quickly. They don't have to watch a lot of videos or anything like that. that was a big lesson for me because I feel like I did kind of waste a lot of time trying to create things that, yeah, just didn't convert well, but really spent a lot of time on them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:31]:\
Yeah. No, same. I've I've I've done it, Shacey. So hopefully the people that are in the sort of beginner space on this summit or learning from our mistakes. Don't go through that. okay. So so failing to do an email list and book were you focused more on social media before you did that then?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:12:50]:\
Yeah. Definitely. like I said, when I started, there was no Instagram, no I'm not on TikTok now, but I'd like to keep hearing from talk about TikTok. it was Facebook and Twitter. So I was doing a lot of Twitter chats. I actually had my own Twitter chat for a while. There wasn't Facebook groups, so it was like my Facebook page. Yeah. I'm just really trying to, yeah, connect with people there. I'll say being on Twitter, it's still my favorite channel, like, for fun. Okay. I don't get a lot of traffic or conversions there, so I'll Personally, I don't spend a ton of time on Twitter, but it's so good, I would say, for making connections in the industry. Like, I've met so many other bloggers through that. I'm definitely thankful for Twitter. kinda like learning the culture of each platform, I'd say. Like, each one has its own benefits. And I don't think you need to be everywhere. I think you could say, like, you know what? This one's good for that, but do I really need that? This is what I'm really trying to see. Like, where can I do that?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:44]:\
Yeah. It it goes back to your mission, like you said. You know, where where is it gonna be best to grow that community?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:13:51]:\
and I get a lot of people who especially again in the travel space. Instagram is the thing. Yeah. And they wanna figure out how to grow traffic from Instagram, and it's not that you can't. I get some okay traffic, but it's like, if you think about the culture of Instagram where people are scrolling, they're not really clicking away, and then you think about Pinterest, or even Facebook where people do click away, it's gonna make a lot more sense if you wanna grow your traffic to be on Pinterest where people are literally scrolling to click away. Yeah. Or even or even YouTube or something.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:21]:\
because -- Exactly. Yeah. Even Pinterest are more certain than social media because I feel like Instagram is, like, You follow them because you're fans of them. You're not necessarily clicking over, but they're part of your tribe. That's where you can get them under email list. You know, it's not like a regular traffic drive. to your content. But, yeah, okay. Then I just say you wanna you want even more inside stuff than than actually click once to go join my email\
\
Jessie Festa [00:14:48]:\
Yeah. Yeah. And most of my good clicks, I believe come from my bio. Like, I have a link in my bio that I track with different, I don't use Linktree. I actually basically created a Linktree on my own page just to get the traffic to my site. Yeah. I can track it because it's just there. That's the only place. And, you know, like, in a share and Instagram, they don't really let you link, so it makes sense that that would be where the most of the links are coming from. Some of the swipe ups, but yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:17]:\
Gotcha. okay. So what's one thing you've kind of note? Cause you have been in the blogging game a long time. by blogging standards. what are some of the things you've noticed changed over time? Obviously, social media landscape has changed and continues change. I don't think people like me. I'll ever figure out TikTok or why I would use it, but well, it's like it's generally confident. But, you know, so how have things changed over time where, you know, if you were starting today, do things differently.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:15:49]:\
I would say that when I started 2011 bloggers, like, I would never tell anyone I was a blogger. I don't remember what I would call myself. and I know even today there are some, you know, negative connotations depending who you're talking to, but it really was so new and so strange that, like, if you pitched a brand of partnership, even if you had amazing traffic, it still was like, oh, like a blogger, we'd No. Like, you're not a real journalist, basically. It was a thought. Yeah. So I feel like one of the biggest changes is that now a blog is considered an actual business, which is great, and also in that same idea, bloggers are starting to actually run their blogs more like businesses, like having products. I always tell my students that they should really consider having their own product at some point. like I said, a lot of them wanna work with brands of, like, the big exciting thing, which is very lucrative, but you really don't have full control. You can meet a brand. It's the best fit, but they don't have a budget or they've used up their budget or whatever. You have no control over that, where you do have control over growing your email list or whatever, growing your social media, wherever you can kind of grow your community. And then, you know, the larger you can grow your community, Hopefully, the more sales we can make on your product. Like, for me, I do see pretty steady arrow up. The more I grow my email list, the more my income grows with my product. And I do have control over that because there's strategies that I'm like, this works really well. Mhmm. Let me do that again. Like, webinars, like, I love creating videos for social media and then pairing it with an opt in that does really well, running Facebook ads. So these are things I know work really well, and I can just keep repeating them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:39]:\
Yeah. I I mean, I think everyone that kinda likes the idea of working with companies, but at the same time, that's not nearly as scalable. Right? It's it's a lot of instances. It's like a 1 and done. you know, which can be great when you're starting out and you're still trying to grow that and so that income from products or affiliate or whatever is not a lot. but I feel like the longer you're in it, the less partnerships like that you tend to do because it's it's kinda it's one and done. Like, it's it's great. It's fine, but I think I've only ever done, like, 2 because it's like,\
\
Jessie Festa [00:18:15]:\
Yeah. I do. I do work with brands a lot. Like, I've I actually have a have a course on it. Yeah. But I could say, like, Don't make the only thing. Like, somebody -- Yeah. Absolutely.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:\
Yeah. Yeah. And I I'm I mean, I just I would be very picky about too. Like, you really wanna make sure they're the right partnerships. Like, they can be fantastic. I think it's I see partnerships done really well, or I'm like, that's awesome. you know, but I've seen them done really poorly too.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:18:41]:\
The thing, if if it's the only thing you're doing, how can you be picky? It's like how you're gonna eat unless you just see us everything. And that's the thing too. and even, like, for my sponsored content, my rate is probably much higher than most people's, but that's because I'm not trying to do them all the time. And I do sometimes at brands who are like, you know, oh, that's so much higher than, like, you know, everyone else. I'm like, well, There are people who pay it, and we have really great partnerships because it's a great fit. I can put the time into really creating amazing content, promoting it, and all this stuff that I think is necessary to have a great partnership, 1st, quickly know, getting something out there and then forgetting about it and not having time to do the analytics and all that stuff. So\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:23]:\
-- Yeah. No. And that's a great point is I think people miss that when it comes to sponsorships. It's a little bit off topic, but they, you know, they think it's when done. But if you can show sort of the results for the brand, like, that's open additional partnering with that brand. later on.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:19:38]:\
One thing I definitely hear a lot from, like, the brands I work with is, that like, the analytic, like, a lot of bloggers won't send back the analytics. So they're sort of, like, left in the dark with a lot of that information, and that's what brand wants to know, like, how did this work out?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:55]:\
Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:19:56]:\
So you're sort of letting the brand down a little bit, but also making the PR person's life a lot harder too.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:02]:\
Yeah. Yeah. And and showing, hey. This did well. Let's do, you know, something else again in the future is another thing. And then the other space I feel like when it comes to brand partnerships, a lot of bloggers fail on is not having a contract. So just --\
\
Jessie Festa [00:20:15]:\
That's right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:15]:\
Yeah. -- very important. Just to touch\
\
Jessie Festa [00:20:18]:\
on. included in it too. Exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:21]:\
Yeah. okay. So so back to more community building type of topic, so kind of once you are growing because there's obviously grow, grow, grow, you know, what do you do to kind of nurture your community? and kind of keep it a community as opposed to just people you sell it to. Right? It's it's more than that. Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:20:43]:\
So I have used Gary Vaynerchuk. I think he's the first one who said the the give give give ask kind of idea. And then I just adapt that to my email. basically, I create 3 emails that are just pure giving. Usually, I'm teaching a strategy. Maybe I create a video and I put it in the email, maybe I share about a free giveaway, but I'm not asking for anything in return. the one thing I do pretty much always do in my emails is I ask a question at the end. because then I can get to know my audience more, you know, the what problems they have. we can connect on a deeper level, grows that relationship, which is really, really powerful. And then in the 4th email, I might pitch an affiliate or pitch a product. You know, just trying to keep that balance so that when I do share a product. Like, I say, oh, hey, my membership is open for, enrollment. They're not like, oh, she's always selling. It's like, no. She I'm giving, giving, giving, giving, I'm giving really good information. I'm not holding back. And then they know at that point, like, okay. She, you know, she really cares. And that's something I actually do get from my community a lot with this strategy is they feel like I genuinely do care, and that's pretty much the best compliment that I could get. because I do I do really really care. And, yeah, I just think about that while I'm writing my email. I just kind of picture my ideal audience member sitting in front of me, what do they need to know, and how can I tell them step by step in the easiest way in the most clear way how they can solve this problem. So my goal is that with each email, I'm helping them solve some problem in their lives. and even with the sales emails, I'm always telling some kind of story. Maybe I'm even still teaching a strategy. Like, I still want them to open it and feel like they enjoyed reading that email.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:32]:\
Mhmm. Yeah. It I mean, because e email as much as it gets a bad rap here and there, it really is you know, people do check it. Right? They don't always They do digital detox where they're not on social media. Mhmm. They don't I don't check DMs. You know, like, but email, email gets checked. It's it's actually a really great platform, especially if you're you're treating your people like people and, you know, not just dollar signs or, you know, I don't even know if some of the other kind of approaches people take, but I feel like the ones that really nail it you know, it's because they they are building a community like you said.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:23:11]:\
Yeah. And I think it's like, you know, telling stories. It's huge. I'm always thinking, like, even if say, like, you know, in a launch, you usually have an FAQ email. Usually at the beginning, I'm like, okay, what story could I tell go with this. Like, I want it to be fun and engaging email. I don't just want it to be, hey, like, the sale ends at 10. Like, here's some questions you might have, which think that could be beneficial too. You are answering people's questions, but I think you can be a little bit more creative. And I also think too when you can add in the stories, Have fun with it. It's it feels better. Like, I just feel more creative. Like, I enjoy it more, and I genuinely actually really love writing emails. They do it live in New York City. So, like, on the subway a lot, I'll just kinda, like, write emails, think about what I might wanna say. Yeah. It's fun.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:57]:\
Yeah. No. It's it's it's fine because the session I reported yesterday Amanda Page was pretty much about in injecting stories into your content makes it uniquely yours because there's lots of travel bloggers out there. There's lots of personal finance bloggers. There's lots of, you know, lifestyle or fashion, you know, but why people go to your content is the stories you tell because you're not just throwing out you know, the questions or the 10 tips on this, you know, because they can get that anywhere.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:24:24]:\
And I think too that goes with\
\
Jessie Festa [00:24:26]:\
the, like, building a community because why will someone wanna hear my excerpts over somebody else's. Yeah. because I have my own unique stories. I have my own unique style. I do write in a very obviously write how I talk. Yeah. and I do that on purpose. Maybe it's not always the perfect grammar or whatever, but I want it to feel like we're having a conversation.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:46]:\
Yeah. Talking with someone is supposed to at somebody. Exactly. Yeah. No. I love it. okay. So what would you kind of say is, like, your your top piece of advice for bloggers who are, you know, maybe they've been out a while, and they're new to it, and they're just not seeing a lot of traction when it comes to building the community. what kind of advice would you give them?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:25:07]:\
I would say, you know, really try to picture that end goal and then think about kind of work backwards. What you need to do to get there. Don't think about every single thing that you wanna do, but say, you know, like, For me, a big goal this year is growing my membership to over I mean, this is the big goal, like, over a thousand numbers. That would be my big, big goal. So what do I need to do to make that happen and kind of work backwards without, getting sidetracked, which is really tricky? what I like to do is I basically will break up however many months and say, okay. This month, I need to complete this and how can I break that up into basically 4 kind of sprints. So it's kind of how I organize myself. but also a lot of it comes down to mindset. And I notice with my membership, I do these 15 minute onboarding calls. So I get to know people a little bit more, and I can say every few people, they'll come out with a lot of, kind of like money blocks, but also ways mentally that I think they're already holding themselves back. For example, I'll often talk to people who say, oh, you know, I don't even need to be doing this because my husband makes so much money, but just something I'm like maybe hoping can happen or, you know, oh, I want this to happen, but if it doesn't, I don't care, but it I think it's almost like\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:32]:\
Yeah. Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:26:34]:\
Exactly. And I think it's like, I\
\
Jessie Festa [00:26:36]:\
I think most people have heard that quote whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right. Mhmm. I think that's so true. so I think, you know, maybe first before you even put any strategy into practice, really sit with yourself and think about what kind of negative self talk you have and figuring out why that is. And then reminding yourself of your own unique abilities and maybe things you accomplished in the past. I know for me, that's like a huge thing I did last year.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:05]:\
Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:27:05]:\
Like, really focusing on mindset and thinking about kind of the ways I hold myself back the excuses I make and why that is and how I can change that. but yeah, even beyond that, I think basically starting with that end goal and saying, okay. Here's what I need to do before I reach that. And I I also realize that a lot of people They start blogging and they wanna start making money right away. Not that that can't happen, but if you think about any business, like, if you were gonna open a bakery, you'd be out six figures and you would have a loss for a while. So This is still a business. You're lucky that it's a blog and it has lower overhead. Yeah. But it will take some time to first bill. It's a lot.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:51]:\
You know, I always kinda think if you can make it through the 1st year and you're still being consistent, like, you're probably gonna make it. you know, I feel like most people that that don't stick with blogging, they fall off in the 1st year. So --\
\
Jessie Festa [00:28:03]:\
Exactly. Yeah. And I think too, like, a\
\
Jessie Festa [00:28:05]:\
lot of people I talk to, they're like, I just started my blog yesterday. I wanna work with a brand. Do you think I should pitch them? And I'm like, What is your brand? What's your mission? you know, what kind of content will help this audience that you have in mind? How are you gonna get people to view this content, and then how are you gonna convert them onto your email list, and then how are you gonna nurture them? I think that's like a, you know, a very short way to put, like, a strategy together. Yeah. But, yeah, basically You need to start first. You need to know who you are. You need to confidently be able to tell potential customers, potential partners, what you do and what makes you unique before I think you really wanna start creating products and working with brands and all that kind of stuff.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:56]:\
Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, and that kind of goes back to the mindset too of, like, having, you know, clear idea in mind. And I just wanted to add on the flip side, you were like, think about whatever negatives I'll talk to you, but also think about because sometimes it's a fear of success. Definitely. Like, okay. What's the worst thing that's gonna happen if you succeed? you know, because there are those fears, oh, am I gonna, like, get sued if I'm being noticed? Am I gonna, you know, so so don't don't forget to recognize those well. Like, maybe it's not negative self talk holding you back. Maybe it's a fear of success that you kind of break down and get some, you know, get some perspective. But, yeah, okay. That, I mean, that was fantastic. It was like notes. so kind of final question I guess I have for you is is there any sort of advice you see out there a lot that you feel should be ignored? that you're like?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:29:49]:\
Actually, I got an email yesterday from one of my students that I was sort of like Really, I don't agree with this at all. She was told by someone that she should be focusing solely on Instagram and that blogs are gonna be obsolete, which I'm I'm like, I feel like if anything, any how many channels will go under before websites are anything, Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:12]:\
Yeah. That's the list. Yeah.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:30:14]:\
Yeah. Like, we've seen with Vine and Google Plus. Like, these people with these huge audiences lost them or had to get them over to another platform. Whereas, like, your website, you could have everything. You could have your social media on there, your products, your videos, posts like your leads locked in and your posts and your pages are going to show up in Google whereas you know that instagram may be gets a lot of traction when you post it, but eventually it's gonna go down your feed. So I don't know if this is in every space, but at least in the travel space, and I think the lifestyle space There's this idea that Instagram is literally everything. If you don't have a big Instagram following, you can't have a successful business. That is not true at all. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:55]:\
I feel like that exists too in, like, the YouTube space.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:30:58]:\
Like, of\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:59]:\
course, you know, a lot of them don't have sites and that's fine. They're doing great, but, like, if YouTube changes their algorithm or their, you know, it's one of those things that you don't have total control over. It's good to have that as well. You know?\
\
Jessie Festa [00:31:13]:\
I mean, even look at, the I think it's pronounced Kappa, the children's protection laws,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:19]:\
Mhmm.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:31:20]:\
I'm not big on YouTube, but I've been listening to a lot of the YouTubers I follow. And, essentially, a lot of the, from what I understand, people who are making a lot of money promoting things that might be child friendly are now gonna be pretty demonetized because they don't wanna put ads on these. basically, they don't wanna put ads on ads to children. Yeah. So if you were say a YouTuber who was making a ton of money, maybe reviewing toys or something like that you potentially just lost a lot of income. So algorithms and laws like that do change. As I think with the website, you can just do so much more because it's not just your YouTube videos. It's not just your Instagram shares. It's your entire business. Like, your blog is your online brick and mortar. Like, that's what I always think of it as. My storefront is my website.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:08]:\
You're the second speaker so far to say,\
\
Jessie Festa [00:32:11]:\
So -- Really? Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:14]:\
So so, no, I like it. but, yeah, no, I think I think that's perfect example of of what we're talking about. and so for, you know, this, I mean, I think this session was just fantastic. but for anyone who wants to follow you more, you, I mean, I don't know how you do it all, but so you're you obviously, you run Jesse on a journey You also have travel blog prosperity and a podcast for travel bloggers that really helps them. And then you, are kindly giving away a 4 day e course that people can watch sort of help, you explain it better than I do, but help them with their blog. But I think you kinda mentioned it's like a blog makeover. Right.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:32:56]:\
So -- Yeah. And it's basically four short videos. I realize people have, you know, not a lot of time. So four just kinda like fluff free actionable videos that will take you step by step from the branding to the monetization aspect. So in the most succinct way possible, basically.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:33:13]:\
Yeah. So absolutely check that out and, you know, social media and stuff with you, or, you know, I mean, check that out because then you'll get her emails. but social media as well, all those links and stuff are on this page. Thank you again, Jesse, for doing this. This is, I learned so much. I really appreciate it.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:33:32]:\
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.840] - Liz\
All right, guys. I'm so excited to have back this speaker. She was part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough Summit and so grateful that she was part of that one and that she was willing to come back to this one. She is a travel blogger and she's the founder of travel blog Prosperity. Prosperity, I can talk, a membership community for bloggers that want to grow their traffic community income. I mean, she does so much with her stuff. She's been featured in Business Insider, CNN, Jessie Festa, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:00:39.850] - Jessie\
Thank you for having me.\
\
[00:00:41.440] - Liz\
Yeah, so we're going to be talking about collaborations. So, I love kind of the topic you submitted was like how to use collaborations to grow your traffic and income. So, first question I want to ask you is why collaborations over other growth methods?\
\
[00:00:57.040] - Jessie\
Yeah, so I think collaboration could be a tool to use with other growth methods. But you know, when you're starting out, it's like you don't have an audience yet, or even if you've been blogging for a while, you have your audience, but there's so many other people that could benefit from what you have to share with them. So, why not work with other people who already have that audience and get in front of them? So, for example, there is another travel blogger. We're both solo female travel bloggers. That's kind of our niche. But we also both teach about blogging, but we're not competitors with our products. Her products are really related to Tik, tok and selfpublishing, where mine are other topics like list building and affiliate marketing and things like that. So, we collaborate all the time because I know she has travel bloggers in her audience, I have travel bloggers in my audience. So, it benefits for us to kind of get in front of each other's audiences. That's just one example, but yeah, it's a great way to get in front of the people that you haven't reached yet, but that would be perfect for your community.\
\
[00:02:03.340] - Jessie\
The other thing is you could also collaborate with bloggers and brands to basically take some of the load off. For example, if you want to cocreate a product together, maybe you could have done that on your own. But there is strength in numbers and there's also strength in not having to do every single task yourself.\
\
[00:02:25.240] - Liz\
Yes. Because you know one of the goals of this summit is to help you realize kind of what you need to do and what you can just take off your plate. Whether that's by collaborating with someone or realizing it doesn't align with your business goals and just not having to do it anymore, it really varies. So, let's kind of dive in. You gave a few examples, but let's kind of dive into some specific examples of ways bloggers can collaborate. You know, maybe they don't have a product yet or something. You know what are some collaboration strategies that they could think about trying?\
\
[00:02:57.190] - Jessie\
Yeah. So, I think the basic collaboration, I know a lot of bloggers do, you don't have to be huge, you don't have to have a product to do is two different content collaborations. I mean, there's more than two, but two comes to mind, guest posting and collaborative posts. So, for guest posting, you know building backlinks is really good for search engine optimization and getting your sites seen, especially when you're a newer blogger and you really need to start building those backlinks. They're kind of like a vote of confidence from other bloggers that tell Google, okay, yeah, this is someone you can trust. So, if you could guest post, let's say your blog is about solo female travel, you might find other established high-quality solo female travel blogs and say, hey, I'd love to write a guest post on XYZ topic and you know make sure that they also allow you to have, I'd say, at least two backlinks to certain blog posts on your site and then maybe even an author bio. I know when people get posts from me, that's what I offer to contextual backlinks and a bio with your homepage and your social. So that's sort of a collaboration strategy anyone could do.\
\
[00:04:04.710] - Jessie\
And then collaborative posts, I like to create them and I also like to be a part of them. So collaborative posts are blog posts where many different people are giving inputs. So, for example, let's say, I'm writing a collaborative post on ten things to do in New York city. I'll reach out to, you know, I'll ad Tip and then maybe nine other bloggers also share a tip and the benefit for them is they get a backlink to their site. The benefit for me is I get other voices on my site, maybe tips that I didn't even know. I like to do collaborative posts, especially for maybe topics I want to cover that I don't think I could cover all on my own. Okay, so that's a strategy that could be good, whether you're creating the collaborative posts. If you're creating it, another benefit is the people that submitted tips will hopefully also share it, usually get that kind of boost in traffic. And the benefit for them is of course the back links and the visibility.\
\
[00:05:02.740] - Liz\
Yeah, and I will say as a newer blogger, if you make it super easy, it's a great way to start creating a relationship with like established bloggers. And it also just makes your site look good that even though you maybe are a newer blogger, you have Jessie or some other big blogger that's actually willing to be on your site. So, I think that, I don't do that enough but.\
\
[00:05:31.160] - Jessie\
Once a month. That's my goal.\
\
[00:05:34.910] - Liz\
There you go. I like. Okay, so we talked about kind of guestposts and stuff. I know some other ideas you mentioned before and I'd love for you to chat about them are like webinars, challenges and giveaways, because those are all very different beasts. I think a guest post and a collaborative post that's like an email, you know, you can screw it up. Don't get me wrong, I get really bad guestpost pitches all the time, but it doesn't actually take much to be a decent guest post pitch, by the way. But you know what are some of the other ways? Because those I feel like it involves a lot more work.\
\
[00:06:11.360] - Jessie\
Yes. So, I guess the next level, I would say, even if you're semi newer, is a three giveaway. So, I've done this before where the one I did was for travel bloggers. So, myself and another blogger, we decided to create, I forget what we called it, I think it was the "Free Travel Bloggers Toolbox or Toolkit". And we reached out to as many other travel bloggers we knew who gave blogging related freebies away, whether that be like lightroom presets or tips for self-publishing or ebook on how to like grow your Instagram, just all things travel bloggers would be interested in. And we put it into basically a landing page that we all promoted for one week as a free toolkit. And again, strength and numbers. We had, I think 22 people in there, all emailing our list and saying, hey, here's this free toolkit you can get that will help you like grow and monetize your travel blog. So that worked out really well, and it's something I recommend even to my newer bloggers in my membership and courses who have all had success with it. I know one of my members recently did a solo travel toolkit.\
\
[00:07:24.660] - Jessie\
I actually took part in it and it went really well, she said. So that's something you might think about. Of course, you could also do paid giveaways where you're working with say, brands. So many ways to do giveaways. I do them many different giveaways every year. But one that comes to mind, so I can give an example is my spring giveaway. It's 14 days, one price per day. And I work with brands that have affiliate programs, so they submit a prize. I don't pay the brands, they don't pay me unless they opt for some kind of additional perk, like they want to sponsor blog posts or additional promotion. But just to be included, they just have to donate the prize, it has to be at least worth $50 and they're going to ship it. But at the end, they also all offer a discount to everyone who took part in the giveaway who didn't win. And I would use my affiliate link, so that's how I monetize that without necessarily having to try to get paid sponsors. That being said, you absolutely could be paid for a giveaway. I've done that a few different ways.\
\
[00:08:32.520] - Jessie\
I've been paid a flat fee for a giveaway deliverables. I'm also going to give you the feature blows, all the social promotion, the email promotion stacked afterwards. Or another way you could do it, because I know newer bloggers sometimes like, I don't really want to reach out and be like, this is what I charge for a giveaway, you could offer to pay per result. So, something I've done with certain brands I've worked with for giveaways is I was paid $2 per email lead I got them, and the giveaway was how we got those leads. So, that can be also a good way to go about it. Just make sure that the result is something you actually think you could get. Because you know if you totally think you're only going to have ten people enter the giveaway, $20 probably not like super worth the time.\
\
[00:09:21.790] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah.\
\
[00:09:22.150] - Jessie\
So, yeah, there's so many different ways to go about giveaways. The other thing that I really love doing in terms of collaboration is webinar swaps.\
\
[00:09:32.040] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:09:32.560] - Jessie\
So, I've done this a couple of ways. I've worked with affiliate partners for this as well as other bloggers, but it's kind of the same thing because the gist is that, say, the person I'm working with, they're going to create the webinar and I am then going to promote it to my audience.\
\
[00:09:52.920] - Jessie\
And then the product pitched at the end is going to use an affiliate link for me that's going to get me referral income. And you could do it the other way too. If you have a course, you might want to work or another product, let's say a course, you could look for creators that you think would be perfect to promote it to their audience, get people into your free webinar that pitches your product and then you give them affiliate commission. Does that make sense? I feel like I went back and forth a little bit.\
\
[00:10:22.660] - Liz\
Yeah, no, it absolutely does. So, I've actually been aware of all these ideas. I've done them all at some point. But I'm never good at like consistently collaborating. I'm like, oh yeah, I want to do that more. Like I said earlier, I want to be on more podcast, you know, but I haven't actually managed it. So how do you go about making it actually happen?\
\
[00:10:48.260] - Jessie\
Yes. So, do I have my planner here, yeah. So, I schedule out my month into basically like there's basically four weeks in a month. So, four sprints. One week is content and outreach, and I'll get back to that in one sec. That's going to be important for this. One week is promo planning. One week is travel, blog, prosperity, content, getting my membership content ready for the next month because every month is a new course and you know all that kind of stuff. And then the fourth week is overflow. And maybe writing more content, maybe doing more promo planning. If it's like a huge promotion. When it comes to the promo planning, I have this like the summit's in here for January, but it's just an ugly piece of scrap paper that every month of the year, list it out and try to keep it to one big rate. I need to kind of organize it better, but it could be something like the Blogger Breakthrough Summit except in January when it's promo planning week in December, I'm going to get all the content ready. And sometimes, obviously, things have to move around depending when I, you know, when swipe copy becomes available and stuff like that.\
\
[00:12:00.850] - Jessie\
But it sets a week for me to get that done.\
\
[00:12:04.360] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:12:04.670] - Jessie\
Now, I also mentioned promo, sorry, content and outreach. So, I do what I call outreach days, where at least one day a month, full day, I sit down and I think of who I might want to work with, and I reach out to them. For me, many times, this means looking for people who would be great affiliates for my courses and my membership. So, for travel blog prosperity, I might Google something like best travel blogging courses. I want to know who ranks for that term, who has these listicles that already rank for that keyword. And then I'll reach out to them and I'll say, hey, I'll give you, you know a free month to check out my membership. And then if you like it and want to add it to your guide, I can create an affiliate link with increased commission for you. And I also do that. I run New York city photo tours and photo shoots. I do that for that too. That's a big one. Another goal I have with my membership, I don't know everything. I love having guest teachers come on.\
\
[00:13:08.460] - Jessie\
So, I will do outreach for that. Hey, if you teach a course or workshop in my membership, I'd love to create something for you in return. So, think about if you want to do this too.\
\
[00:13:20.680] - Liz\
Sure.\
\
[00:13:21.220] - Jessie\
Your unique goals for your blog, what you want to accomplish, and who would be the perfect partner to help get that done. Maybe that means, you know, reaching out to, like I said before, people that would be perfect to promote a webinar you've created that pitches your product, and you really want to get it out to as many people as possible. Really look for those creators who have that audience that would be perfect. You can see they have great engagement with their audience and things like that.\
\
[00:13:50.590] - Liz\
Yes. Okay. So, I love that idea of having, like, a one day dedicated to that. But how do you keep it organized, right? Because once you do an outreach, then there's back and forth, and then there's like, well, I never actually heard back from that person, do I follow up? Like how do you keep that organized and keep track of it all?\
\
[00:14:09.010] - Jessie\
Yeah, I honestly just use a Google spreadsheet. I have different tabs for different projects. So, like affiliate outreach, like looking for people to be in my course affiliates, that would be a tab. My NYC photo stores affiliates outreach, that would be a tab. Travel blog prosperity, guest teachers, that would be a tab. So, yeah. And then I'll put, like, the name, the contact info, the date I reached out, and then if they respond yes or no, I'll put that. And then I'll also have a section that's not really on the bottom, but I just have a list of people that okay, next time I do an outreach day, this is who I want to reach out to. Maybe it's someone I just kind of discovered on another day during the month. I see them post something or they email me and I'm like, okay, wait, note to self. When I do when I sit down to do all the outreach, I'm going to reach back out to them and I'll just put them on that little list.\
\
[00:15:05.580] - Liz\
Awesome. No, I like that. I seriously just need to get better about it. Obviously, the summit is a collaboration tool. I collaborate with a lot of people on the summit, but it's only once a year. And that's another example of a way to collaborate. If you want to do a summit.\
\
[00:15:24.410] - Jessie\
That's like the perfect idea. You could try to teach. There's so many awesome courses in this and workshops, but like, A, obviously that would be hard to have all that knowledge in one person, but B, even the thought of recording would be plus workshops, that would be wild. Like, A, the workload is less with more people, but B, now you have all these awesome speakers also promoting it and that strength in numbers can be so powerful as you know that you've been doing this.\
\
[00:15:56.660] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay. So, I think you know, we've touched on kind of a great approach to collaboration, but I always think it's important to know kind of potential pitfalls and mistakes people make regarding this. Could you share some examples?\
\
[00:16:11.210] - Jessie\
Yeah. So, I would say, one thing that comes to mind is if you're collaborating on say, an event like a summit or a product, you really, like if you're cooking, you're cocreating something, you want to be so clear on who is doing what. 'Cause I've definitely run into it where I end up feeling like I'm doing everything and we're still both kind of reaping the same benefits because we've like cocreated it together or yeah, just any.\
\
[00:16:43.830] - Liz\
[inaudible 00:16:44] as an adult.\
\
[00:16:44.300] - Jessie\
Yeah. And you just want to really make sure, like really think about the amount of time and effort it will take you to do each task and really divvy it up, so that each person is, A, doing the tasks that kind of speak to their interests and strengths, but B, you feel like it's equal. You don't feel like you're doing all of the work. And I think just clarity and any kind of collaboration, that's going to be the key. I'm even thinking of my New York city photo tours when I created my liability waiver and also the terms and conditions. It's like I updated all the time when new issues arise, like what is every single thing that could go wrong? Like what do we need to kind of address in the beginning, so everyone's on the same page?\
\
[00:17:29.060] - Liz\
Yes. And I will say when you are collaborating, the legal aspect, having a contract in place is huge. Like I know it doesn't sound, it makes it more efficient, right? But it's to protect both of you, so please don't skip that part. We're not going to dive too far into that. We have legal sessions, but I just, yeah.\
\
[00:17:49.090] - Jessie\
Yeah, and I honestly appreciate it too. Like, when I speak at a summit or I contribute something to a bundle, I like having a contract because I want to know what's expected of me and exactly what to expect, when's the payout date, how many emails should I send, all that stuff. It's good for both parties, to be clear on that.\
\
[00:18:10.050] - Liz\
Yeah, and I think with a contract, people pay more attention to those things in it as opposed to an email buried somewhere. It's like, well, you were supposed to do this. And you're like, you know, you're like, wait, let me go find that email. I don't know what you're asking me. Okay. So, potential mistakes, obviously, not having some legal place. Any other mistakes? Because I think we both mentioned how we both get really bad pitches. Like, what makes a pitch good versus bad in your experience?\
\
[00:18:45.040] - Jessie\
One thing I don't like, and honestly, I usually just leave the email, is people will be like, oh, I'd love to guest post for you. I heard you're looking for, like I just posted today in a group, I'm looking for solo female travel guides for different cities, cities I haven't been to, but I want to grow. That's my main category. People will just email me like, hey, I travel solo, I'd love to write for you. Like that's not a pitch. What's your idea?\
\
[00:19:16.410] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:17.320] - Jessie\
I'm not going to go look at your site and figure out where you've been. Like send me an idea, even if it's just a few sentences, like, what would you cover and why are you the person to cover this can be so helpful. And I'll say on my end, I am very particular with the guest posts that I get. So, before they even write it, I let them know I'm expecting over 2000 words. I'm going to give them the sections and the keywords and the outline. Like I do all that research beforehand because if I'm going to take the time to edit the guest post and if you're going to take the time to write it, like, we both should want it to rank, that could help the guest poster get traffic too.\
\
[00:20:01.140] - Jessie\
So, I'm also on my end, very clear ahead of time that it's not just going to be like, five things to do in New York City with a 500 word little thing that's not going to benefit anyone, really.\
\
[00:20:13.990] - Liz\
Yeah. I have, like, guest post guidelines on my site, and if I get a pitch that doesn't follow those, I just ignore it. Yeah, like, do your homework. It's not, just read those things, follow the guidelines, and chances of being accepted are pretty dang high. It's not that hard.\
\
[00:20:35.440] - Jessie\
Hundred percent. I don't fully follow people when they do the next thing, but it's a good idea if you're pitching an idea to check if it's been covered yet or maybe if like, it has and you see, oh, wait, this hasn't been updated in five years. Say, hey, I saw you had this topic. It hasn't been updated. I'd love to add these additional tips to it, something like that, at least. Yeah, do that little bit of homework. It's really not hard. Google is your friend.\
\
[00:20:59.960] - Liz\
Yeah, I get so annoyed when I get guest pictures of like, we love this post to be on your site. And I'm like, I literally have a post just like that already. Did you even look?\
\
[00:21:07.450] - Jessie\
Like it's on my home page, it's the last thing I wrote.\
\
[00:21:11.810] - Liz\
All right. Also, make sure you send the correct guest post. I had someone who was going to guest post and then they sent me an article on nights for my personal finance site, and I was like.\
\
[00:21:23.510] - Jessie\
It doesn't seem like you're paying attention. \
\
[00:21:26.740] - Liz\
Yeah. No, like, oh, sorry, that was for a different one. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to pass on whatever you came up with because I don't have time.\
\
[00:21:32.960] - Jessie\
Actually, one other thing, no matter what collaboration you pitch, make the email personal and address people by name. I get so many emails. I mean, obviously, the spammy ones that are like, dear Webmaster, which I just [inaudible 00:21:47], but some people don't greet at all, and it kind of just makes me feel like it's a mass email, almost.\
\
[00:21:52.390] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:21:53.510] - Jessie\
So, yeah, if you can make it personal, like genuinely personal, not just like it sounds personal, but it's a mass email like that's going to go a long way. I know I did PR for a company, like, years ago. It was a small startup, and I remember we did like a welcome event or like a launch event, and so many people were like, I never come to these, but your email was so personal. I spent so long writing each email to each blogger, like, going on for like, oh, I think you would love this because of XYZ, like, looking at their site, it really can make a difference.\
\
[00:22:27.460] - Liz\
Yeah. And you can use, so like I use, especially for the summit when I'm pitching and stuff, because I do, I pitch a lot of people, I pitch a lot, you know. Obviously, there's a part of the email that's going to be the same, and having messed up copy and paste before, I do use a tool that's like a mass email thing, but I always include a section of their, like, personal section. Right? And so in my spreadsheet that goes through the tool, I have the personal greeting like, hey, I'm so glad you did this. Last I heard, you're doing this, whatever, I know you just wrapped up a launch. Like, you can make those personalized without it being really hard.\
\
[00:23:08.440] - Jessie\
Yeah. Because obviously, if you're pitching, like, you know when I'm asking people to be a guest teacher on travel blog prosperity, I copy and paste the description of the membership, what would be needed, what I would like offer in return, like that's all copy and pasted. There's no need for me to retype that for 30 minutes every time.\
\
[00:23:25.030] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah.\
\
[00:23:25.330] - Jessie\
But of course, you have those initial lines where I'm saying I think you'd be great to teach about this. I love your work, doing X-Y-Z. Like, I look at what they're doing and what they're an expert in, what their books and courses and products are and things like that.\
\
[00:23:39.710] - Liz\
Yes. Yeah, so, no, I fully agree with that, make it personal. Okay. Any idea you kinda wanna, we covered a lot, and I don't want to overwhelm, any kind of final tips of advice for using collaborations to grow?\
\
[00:23:54.040] - Jessie\
I would say I can't remember if I mention this, but just, I know one question I get in my audience a lot is how do I even begin to know what to collaborate on? Think about your own goals in your blog. What works for someone as a collaboration might not work for another person. For example, we talked about like cocreating products and summits and things like that. Your imagination is the limit with this. So, really think about what you want to achieve with your blogging business, what kind of projects, and tasks, and things, events could help you reach those goals, and who would be the perfect fit to help make it happen more easily for you. So that's where I would kind of start and then go from there.\
\
[00:24:41.620] - Liz\
Okay. And I know you have a freebie for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:24:47.610] - Jessie\
Yeah, so it is a free workshop sharing ten different ways to make money blogging. Along with sharing the ways, I also give tips on how to implement as well as examples of what these sort of revenue streams look like in real life. So, definitely check it out. If you want to monetize a blog, I highly, highly recommend it. And then it's prerecorded. But on the classroom page, there is a question box where if a question comes up during the workshop, you can just type right in there. And I'll get it and I'll respond right away.\
\
[00:25:21.790] - Liz\
That's awesome. And then I think also you've been kind enough to contribute something for those that get the all access pass. If you've been on the fence about the all access pass, do you want to tell them you know what they could get from you and they all inside that pass?\
\
[00:25:35.530] - Jessie\
Yes. So I have included a course on how to update your old content to help grow your traffic. One thing I've noticed a lot is you know we're always thinking about what do I write next, what do I write next, creating a new post. And then we kind of neglect the content we've already created when actually, A, it'll be quicker for you to update it. And B, there is data in your Google search console that can tell you steps to take to update it. And, yeah, that could give you a nice boost in traffic. So, it's going to go over that step by step for you.\
\
[00:26:06.690] - Liz\
All right. So, if you guys want that, go grab the all access pass. Jessie, thank you so much for coming back. It's been so great to see you again.\
\
[00:26:13.990] - Jessie\
You, too, and thank you so much for having me.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm excited for the session today with Katherine Pomerantz of the Bookkeeping Artist. Katherine, welcome and thank you for doing this.\
\
[00:00:08.650] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. I'm very excited.\
\
[00:00:12.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes, because pretty much all of my business, financial knowledge I learned from you.\
\
[00:00:16.710] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Which.\
\
[00:00:19.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Is you're a great teacher, but it's also reflecting on what a poor business owner I could be. But no, no. I've learned a lot in this last year, and I've come a long ways. And so I'm really excited for your session. Can you tell everyone a little about your background and what we're going to cover today?\
\
[00:00:36.600] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Absolutely. Yeah. I am going to talk about taxes in a roundabout way because I came about taxes in a roundabout way. I did not go get an accounting degree. I did not go work in a business the way that a lot of people do. I actually have a degree in theater and dance, and I did the freelance thing for a while. So very similar to a lot of bloggers, actually, where you have something you're really passionate about and you set out to do it, and then you find out like, Wait, this is a business and I need to know business things. And no one warned me about that in art school. So it's difficult. And it was difficult for all my friends, and it was difficult even for all my mentors. There's just not a lot of money knowledge out there. And I wanted to tackle that and I wanted to fix that. So I started just studying money. I knew that there were people who didn't struggle the way that I did. And I fell in love. I felt hard. I completely changed my whole career. I opened my own accounting firm within a year of starting that whole journey, and here we are.\
\
[00:01:39.440] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I now just help other business owners do the same things, acquire all the education, but also implement all that education. But we'll get more into that in a second.\
\
[00:01:49.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. So why don't you tell us a little bit about what we're going to talk about today besides just taxes?\
\
[00:01:56.720] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Absolutely, yeah. I, as an accountant, always get the same questions like, Well, how do I get organized? Can you help me sort out these deductions? What can I do? Honestly, so many of these questions can be answered with a simple Google search. There's incredible bloggers out there who have answered these questions hundreds and hundreds of times, but we read them and we don't follow through. That's the education versus implementation part. The more I've been doing this and the more I work with people who are creative and people who are just really passionate about what they do, the more that I learned the real question is not so much like teach me about taxes. It's, Can you help me with my money stress? Can you help me feel more confident in what I'm doing with this? Can you help me find the answer and feel assured in the answer I'm finding? I think that is really more the crux of the issue. So I have developed over the years a couple of frameworks to help. So I have the let money mindset, and I have this skill that I describe money storytelling. And if you require these two things, really anything, including taxes, becomes easy.\
\
[00:03:03.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
And more importantly, blogging stays fun. You can stay focused on the part of the job you really, really love because you're going to have this really good financial support system underneath you. Just help you grow, help you sustain, help you stay authentic. You don't have to just be into the numbers. So that's what we're going to dive into.\
\
[00:03:21.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, I'm excited for that because I think that was part of a beta course you did. And one of my favorite things that I now have is like, my chart of accounts, which I didn't know what that was before, but I can just be like, How much did I make from affiliate marketing last year? How much did I make from client services? How much did I make from product sales? Which products do you make? And I was like, Oh, I like this. So I can speak from experience that you're a great teacher and you do a great job at getting people to take action. So let's go ahead and dive in. I'm going to let you lead the way. Okay.\
\
[00:03:59.650] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So I'll close actually. I should also mention that this entire mindset thing we're going to talk about is part of what I describe as the Chaos Money Framework. This is a framework that I actually use with my clients. It has seven steps, and this is how I teach you to not only get a handle of your finances, but also implement right away. Because your blog can't wait around. It's also tax season. You don't have time to just sit and wait around until you get better at money. You need a framework to help you just keep going and keep going and keep going. So we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about step one, because it's the most important step, right? You got to really understand that to do steps two through seven. So step one of the Chaos Money framework is embrace chaos. I describe it as embrace chaos because business is chaotic. It's always moving. Your money is always moving. You got a lot of stuff going on with your blogs. I'm pretty sure most of you also have another job in addition to the blog that you run. Almost everyone does.\
\
[00:04:56.890] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So there's a lot going on. And this is where a lot of that stress around money that I first alluded to really comes up because money is an exceedingly emotional topic. Everything that's ever happened to us in our lives affects our relationship with money. Whether you missed the bill and you just got super embarrassed about it, or whether you missed a lot of bills because you were going through something else that was traumatic and your finances were just along for the ride at the time. Whether you fight with your partner about money, fight with your parents about money, just watch your parents fight about money when you're growing up. All of these things bubble to the surface when we have to tackle things like taxes. It's the reason that it feels so overwhelming and so scary and there's so much pressure to get it right. I think a lot of that is really unfair. I think a lot of that comes because we don't really understand the true nature of money because we don't really understand what money is. We don't really know how to put it to work. So the very first thing I always teach people is the Let Money Mindset.\
\
[00:05:54.180] - Katherine Pomerantz\
It's a really simple acronym. It means, Let Money Work for you. So the true nature of money, and I mean this literally. We're going to talk some basic economics here, people, is the true nature of money is that money is a language, it is an energy, and it's a teammate. So let, L-E-T, is what we want to let our money work for us. What do I mean by this? Language, we'll start here. Again, literally money is a language. Liz actually just gave a really good example of I have my chart of accounts. I bet hardly any of you know what that means unless you took some accounting classes in college. There is a jargon to this stuff. And so when we talk about profit, when we talk about revenue streams, we talk about ROIs, those all are jargony words that need to be translated. And so this should actually come as an immense relief. I think a lot of people hear this and they're like, Oh, I don't have time to study a language. That's okay. You're not born knowing a language, so you should forgive yourself. No one is born speaking any language at all.\
\
[00:06:56.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You had to learn it. And each new language you learn becomes harder. And if English is not your first language, you definitely know what I'm talking about. And now I'm asking everyone here to learn the language of money, but there are translators. And so that's one of the best things about the financial industry and the money industry, is that there are translators to help jumpstart this. There are ways that you don't have to be fluent and still be able to get around and still understand. So language is the first aspect of money's nature. Goodness, forgive me. It's very early for me. I'm recording this. It might be a couple of those. I don't have enough coffee.\
\
[00:07:34.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And.\
\
[00:07:35.590] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So that's language. And then we're going to go to energy. Again, this is sound woo woo, but I mean this literally. Money is nothingness. It's not a thing. You can hold up a dollar bill, but that's not what money is. And money is not built on a gold standard anymore. We have something called a Fiat currency, which means that money has value because we all just agree that it has value.\
\
[00:07:59.630] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Economists.\
\
[00:08:00.540] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Can argue about whether or not that's a good system, but it's a system that we've had effectively since the 1930s. So it's probably not going away. And so far it's served us pretty well. So knowing that there's really nothing backing our money except this belief that we all have that money is valuable. What does that leave? How then does money function? And there's a jargony word for this to go back to money's language called cashflow. Money is an actual energetic, creative force. It's going to come and it's going to go. You're going to get money in, you're going to pay money out. And this is what we describe as cash flow if we're talking from a business perspective. But it really is. It operates just like an energy. It operates just like water flowing, how you can divert water into a canal and put it to use, or you can stop water up with the dam and generate electricity. Electricity is another energy. It has a current. You can channel it into these big machines, and it does incredible things for us. That is how money functions. It's even in money's name, currency, that current is all there.\
\
[00:09:01.730] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That is part of money's just intrinsic nature. So if you understand the language of money, you can then harness its energy and put its creative efforts to work for you. And finally, you'll turn money into your teammates. And this is the best... And most of all, I'm biased, but this is the best part for me, is turning money into your teammates. I call it a teammate and not just a resource because of that emotional component I alluded to. You have a relationship with money, and you need to acknowledge and honor that relationship in order to make any progress. You got to be able to open up all those door spots and look it in the face and be like, Look, you're important to me, and I'm still going to give you what you need. I'm still going to nurture this relationship. I'm still going to pay attention to you. I'm still going to listen. I'm going to communicate. If you're in your language. I'm going to give you everything you need to thrive. The energy part and all plays together. And then let's be friends. Let's be teammates. Let me treat you like you're an employee at my business and you're going to work hard if I give you all the right tools to do so.\
\
[00:09:59.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Understanding the fundamental nature of money should give everyone a sense of relief, honestly. Discovering these things was fantastic for me. It was just like, Wow. Okay. I don't have to be so tight-fisted about everything. I also don't have to be so concerned when money is coming and going like it's supposed to.\
\
[00:10:18.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:19.690] - Katherine Pomerantz\
And so as I started working with businesses and with entrepreneurs who were crazy, crazy smart and crazy, crazy good at this, it was apparent to me that A, they understood money's true nature. Again, I told you I'd do that.\
\
[00:10:36.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But they.\
\
[00:10:38.910] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Took it one step further in that they understood money's nature so intensely that they became what I describe a money storyteller. You already alluded to this, Liz, because you're developing these skills. They had the ability to take out financial records, read them over, and they saw through all those numbers to the people and the industry and everything about that business. This is what investors do. This is something I called because I watch people like Warren Buffett who are so brilliant and get all these amazing terms because if you listen to how they talk about their process, they start with the numbers, but they go through the numbers. They see past the numbers. They really dig past these financial reports, and they see the mission, vision, values of the company. They want to reflect on if the CEO is doing a good job. They want to know about the industry as a whole. It's very much a storytelling feature. This is very exciting to me because with my background in dance and with acting, this made perfect sense, right? If we take ballet, for example, choreography is just as technical as money. It has just as much jargon and just as much weird symbolic, amorphous, energetic stuff.\
\
[00:11:52.310] - Katherine Pomerantz\
But we as an audience, knowing none of that, can still go on a journey with the dancer. We still understand the story that they're telling. We still have a very emotional connection, and we're still transformed, we're still moved. So I was very comfortable with this idea of like.\
\
[00:12:05.130] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Oh, this.\
\
[00:12:06.060] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Is a weird, abstract language.\
\
[00:12:09.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
To.\
\
[00:12:10.540] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Throw back as a language, and it's symbolic, but I can use it to tell stories. And the stories that I want to tell are stories about my business. Money wants to communicate with me. And that is my definition of accounting. Money, storytelling. I want you to see past all these numbers and get back to the story of your business. Where are you headed? How are you doing that? What's this information that you need to reflect? And I think knowing that also makes it a lot easier. It's not about knowing all the jargon. It's not about doing all this math. It's about making decisions. It's about leading your business or your blog, in this case, wherever you want to go. So does that all make sense, Liz? Are we all on board?\
\
[00:12:51.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. No, I'm like, I'm like, Yep, yeah, yeah.\
\
[00:12:54.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
This is a repeat for you. No, but.\
\
[00:12:57.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm just like, It's always good to revisit it too. And I'm like, Oh, how... Because I struggle with QuickBooks. But my chart of accounts, and like I said, I was able to just look at that stuff. I can be like, Well, how much actual blogging I do versus working with others and promoting my products versus... I can see how much time I spend on client. I can look at, okay, well, if I want to move in this direction, what was working there? What was producing that income? It starts to tell the story, like you said.\
\
[00:13:30.890] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yeah, that's amazing. I'm so happy. I'm so proud. I'm so glad that you're getting that experience. It's really empowering, I think. And this is a great time to give one caveat is that a lot of what I'm talking about, if you're a beginning blogger, dive deep into these other sessions that are going to help you get going and help you learn to make income and help you get all your products out there. Once you start making money, then it's time to revisit a lot of this. Because again, I'm not here to help you develop a really good blog. My area of expertise is building out that support system, that financial structure to keep blogging fun, to keep it so you can continue doing it and make money and put it to work and let it all happen. So now that we understand this, embrace the chaos idea, we understand money is language, energy, teammates. We want to be money storytellers. That's the goal. Let's dive into how we can actually pull that off. So this is why I developed the Chaos Money Framework, because again, we can intellectually process those things. Like, okay, sure, we get all the emotional aspect now.\
\
[00:14:31.680] - Katherine Pomerantz\
And I'm intellectual on board with, okay, this money storytelling element. How do I actually do that? How do I get started? So the seven steps of the Chaos Money Framework are: embrace chaos, make a value-centered business plan, gather your data, set up your accounting tools, clean up, money map, step six, my favorite, and accountability. And then there's a secret step eight, which is repeat. So again, this is not something that we're going to learn overnight, but this is something to get you moving, to get you better, to learn as you go because you don't have that time to sit around. That's my experience. So maybe I'm biased. That was my philosophy, but it works very well for the type of people I work with. We've taken a deep dive into embrace chaos, and I think that that really is the crux of a lot of the stress around things like taxes. So what do I mean then by the value-centric business plan? This is your translation tool. This is how you're going to dive in and see past those numbers. So we're actually just going to start with the end. Begin with the end in mind is a Stephen Covey thing.\
\
[00:15:39.000] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's seven habits of highly successful people. Great advice. Begin with the end in mind. So I want you to get clear about why your blog exists. What is your mission? Literally, what did you set out to do? Who do you help? How do you help them? What's the mission of your blog? What is the vision for your blog? What do you want your blog to look like in the future? If you're trying to grow this into a really robust revenue stream, you've got to have a clear vision of how that looks in one year, five years, 10 years. Are you going to hire people? Are you going to take on ads? Are you going to find sponsors? Or do you just want this to be a personal diary? And maybe actually it's a way for you to grow a different career and just build your expertise. So what's that vision for your future? What are you working towards? And then what are your values? This is critical. It's understanding what is important to you as a person and how this will help you in your work. An example is freedom is my number one value.\
\
[00:16:34.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So everything that I do with people is to free them, right? I work with business owners. You start your own business for freedom. And that is something that I very, very much strive for and very much stand for. That's how value could affect a business. So mission, vision, values, turn those into statements, and you got yourself a pretty good plan. You also have a pretty good translation tool, as I mentioned. If you're ever stuck and you are looking at numbers and you're getting lost, look at your mission, vision, and value statements. I point to my wall because I literally have them taped to my wall where I'm like, This is what I'm doing. This is why I'm doing it. This is where I'm going and this is what matters to me. I can now make a decision based on these numbers because this is what I want to do. It's very helpful. So step one, embrace the chaos. Understand the mindset of money is a chaotic force, and that's good. We want that creative energy. Step two, value-centered business plan. Step three, four, five is the accounting part. So first of all, gathered data. Where is your information coming from?\
\
[00:17:34.970] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Bank statements? Are you using any accounting tools? Where are you paying bills out to? Just get yourself... Not even organized, literally just write down where does all the information need to find, gather data. Step five is then set up your accounting system because gathering that data, as you guys know for taxes, is difficult if we do it once a year. I want you to build a system underneath you that allows you to do this over and over and over because if you do it over and over and over in little steps, it's a lot easier. It takes only minutes, not hours. And so that's step five is the accounting system. That was step four, excuse me. Step five is then the cleanup, where we actually take all that data and put it into our accounting system and just let it run and just let it automate. I will take a deep dive into accounting systems in a second. So I know I was racing past that, but we'll get there. Because I want to skip ahead to step six, which is what I call your money map. I call it a money map because I want you to be able to do exactly what I described money storytellers doing.\
\
[00:18:39.290] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I want you to be able to take out all of your financial reports, which could be just as simple as I have a budget or I have my income statement. I know where my money came from. I have a spreadsheet that just tracks my income versus my expenses. That can be your financial report.\
\
[00:18:54.480] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I want.\
\
[00:18:54.890] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You to be able to take that out. I want you to be able to read it with your mission, vision, and values in mind, and I want to be able to compare it to the real-world numbers. So your money map is actually going to be a look ahead. This is going to be your ideal. This is going to be like, This is my goal for the year, or This is my goal for the next three months. This is my real numbers. So this is the numbers that actually happen. If you make a budget, this is what I actually spend versus my budget. And rather than feel guilty, like a lot of people, especially budgets, they feel very limiting. They feel very like, I'm in a box. I want that to free you because this is your aspirational goal, and this is where you're at today. Your money map will then be able to help you break this big goal into milestones and track your progress from point A to point B, point C, point D. And because you have things categorized through that accounting system, like Liz said, she can just open it up and look at things and be like, Oh, this is the exact area I fell down.\
\
[00:19:49.380] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I didn't bring in as much affiliate income as I wanted, or I way overspent throwing my summit together, which I hope is not the case.\
\
[00:19:56.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm actually doing really well in that regard. Thank you.\
\
[00:20:00.480] - Katherine Pomerantz\
No, didn't mean to call you out.\
\
[00:20:03.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
That's okay. I'm happy to be the guinea pig or the go-to for any... We did that. I just redid my home page like last week, but it was awful because I switched away from a certain page builder and whatnot. And so we're doing a session. I was like, Mine's terrible. You could tear it down. And we went to it and I was like, Oh, it's worse than I thought. Images are broken. I'm good. Don't worry about it.\
\
[00:20:27.090] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I'm never worried about you. But that's a good example of how money map works. That's that empowering money storytelling goal I want you to get to. It's a great feeling, you guys. A tax form is another example of a money map. It's actually a really good example of a money map. It's just a money map for the government. They're going to force you to organize everything into these categories, and you put all your data in, and then they have all these formulas that give them an answer. It's a decision making tool, and you have to take action. You've got to pay that final equation off. That's how much tax you owe. That is a money map. Again, it's for the government, though. I want you to build a money map for yourself because the bonus side of that is that not only will you become better at leading your business and achieving your goals, you also make taxes really easy because they will already be organized and you've already been working on it. So that's step six. Step seven then is accountability, where this is my experience. Again, I do this with a lot of people.\
\
[00:21:25.440] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I don't know anybody who does business by themselves very well. Doing things like this summit is amazing. Going out and finding resources, finding experts can be your accountability. Asking a friend, asking a colleague, asking your accountant, Hey, can you look over my numbers? This is my budget. Does this seem realistic? Does this seem possible? I love your advice. Doing research about what do other bloggers spend or what do other bloggers make in sponsorships? Those can all be the accountability portion.\
\
[00:21:54.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
We have a session on sponsorships and how to price yourself out. Love it.\
\
[00:21:59.880] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Love it. You guys are already taking step seven, and I'm very proud of you. Step eight is then repeat. You're going to get better at money the more that you do this and the more that you go through this process. That's actually what keeps you cleaned up. That's actually what makes it easy. That's actually what makes it fun, is seeing your progress over time. This is not, again, money is not static. Embrace the chaos of step one. Money is not going to sit around. You can't just ignore it. It will be doing something. Make sure it's your teammate. Make sure you're reading it. Make sure you're paying attention because it's energetic. It's going to be working. Let's make sure it's working in the right areas. So to recap, embrace chaos. Understand all the mindset stuff we just talked about. Get your mission, vision and value squared away. Gather all your data, put it into your accounting system, clean it up. So make sure all the data gets entered. Build out that money map for yourself. Or the first time once the money map is built, just use your money map. And then accountability. Hold yourself accountable, take action.\
\
[00:22:59.480] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Have somebody else hold you accountable, take action, and then repeat. So the repeat part is what we're going to talk about next. But I want to make sure that I hit on everything, Liz. Are we good? Is there anything you want me to clarify?\
\
[00:23:12.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, no, I think we're good because, as you know, I'm in the repeat and I'm finding little things I missed or mistakes I made when I was setting some stuff up. I'm still clear, but it's a whole process, right? And it's repeating like, I really should be looking at my money a lot more. And yeah. So you're doing great. This is a great refresher for me, and I know it's a great introduction to this for others. So thank you.\
\
[00:23:39.430] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Fantastic. Actually, can I share a story that we had with your money system? Yeah. Okay. So, Liz, as she mentioned, doing the repeat and finding all these mistakes. I want to share a story of me as an expert. I do this professionally all the time, still messing up. Where with Liz's setup, with her QuickBooks, there was just an auto rule that was active that messed up a bunch of stuff in her in front of accounts. But because Liz was paying attention to it, she caught it and reached back out to me. It was all like, Hey, this looks weird. And she only noticed it looked weird because she was doing it over and over because she was paying attention to it. Now that it's tax season, it's still January, we've got plenty of time to get it corrected. She's not near... Well, I hope she's not nearly as stressed. I did mess up on her there.\
\
[00:24:24.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I have full confidence in you helping me to fix it, so it's okay.\
\
[00:24:31.530] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Excellent. This is again why the repeat matters and why the accounting system matters. We wanted it to be automatic, and we wanted it to do a lot of heavy lifting, and it did. But it's only as smart as we let it be, and so that's why we always also have to clean up. So with that tiny example, that is actually what I want to share with you guys today as my freebie. It's not fancy, I will confess to you all. I love bloggers. I do not have your artistic graphic design skills. I don't have all the pretty website stuff done. That's just not my zone of genius. But I do have a lot of good knowledge to share. I do know that the Chaos Money framework can seem very overwhelming. There are seven steps, and it's taken me almost 30 minutes just to walk them through. I have developed a checklist for myself, for clients over the years for them to use on what I call CEO days where you can sit down and do your money math.\
\
[00:25:23.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, that's literally what it is in my ClickUp as a recurring task on the 10th to 25th is my CEO day.\
\
[00:25:29.250] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yes, brilliant. Yes. Liz alluded to the thing is I recommend really doing it twice a month. That's really all you need to do is do it twice a month for a couple of minutes. The first time you do it, it might take you a lot longer. We've all been there, right? This is tax season. Sometimes it takes the whole weekend to get your taxes together. It's going to get less. It takes less and less time the more you do it. That's why we have that repeat in the framework.\
\
[00:25:54.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I don't know that it takes less time, but it's like you're spreading out what would be like a whole weekend or several days throughout the year.\
\
[00:26:03.280] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yes. No, and that's true. I still argue that it takes less time because... And here's why, I know I think this is a great point. You're still going to spend the same amount of time, but you're going to be working on high level things. At the end of the day, you're not just going to get your taxes filed. If you do do this and you do money, like Liz alluded to, she can open it up and make decisions about her business. Your focus is going to be a lot bigger, and it's still going to be about the amount of time it takes in a weekend. You'll have a couple of times a year where it's something like redo your money map that might take a couple of hours. But for the most part, once you set it up, you're good to go. And so to help you with that process, I've created checklists for your CEO days. I have weekly tasks, monthly tasks, and even some daily tasks I have recommended. I also gave you recommendations on time limits. If these things start taking you longer than this, especially as you get used to it, I want you to really consider then, is there a way I can up my accounting system?\
\
[00:26:58.760] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Is there a tool I can implement? Should I bring on something like Freshbooks because I'm invoicing people now? Is Stripe automating the way it should be? Or am I too busy cleaning it up? Is something like PayPal going to serve me better? I actually would put those as PayPal taking too long to clean up and Stripe automating it better, but personal preference. Things like that are decisions that you can pay attention to because of time. And that's like, okay, that's a great time to read. Like, is my spreadsheet now taking... I used to be a big spreadsheet person. Took me hours eventually. It once I really got things up and running and once I really got good at reading through this stuff, so I switched to some automatic tools. I now use things that automate a lot of the process. This is why it's like, Liz is leveled up all the way to using QuickBooks, which is an incredible product.\
\
[00:27:44.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's totally in the frame. I mean, you can say leveled up and using, attempting and trying. I feel like.\
\
[00:27:51.360] - Katherine Pomerantz\
More accurate. Hey, we're all attempting and trying. Software is always updating, and it's always part of the chaos of our system. So it's okay. Yeah. Those checklists I really do want to offer to you guys. So the... Oh. Did I give you? I did give you the link and I don't have it memorized.\
\
[00:28:15.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Don't worry. You don't need to. It is below. So easy peasy. It is below this video. You guys can grab that freebie. So definitely check that out.\
\
[00:28:27.560] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Fantastic. Yeah. Good. Yeah, I normally... Again, it's early. I normally have this all prepped and I'm like, Here's the plug and typing your link. And good. Liz again, professional blogger over here has covered us. She's got it covered. She's got me clickable. So if you are interested in learning how to use the framework better and implementing your own CEO days, I have created some very specific checklists just for that; gathering data, setting up your accounting system, and cleaning it up, and how to use your money map. There's a lot of really good tips in there of questions to ask yourself, things to get started, things to think about. And I did break it down. I gave you weekly, monthly, and even annually. There's some stuff in there just for tax season, which I know is coming up. So I can break down and go into some details if you'd like, Liz. But I feel like you can just go get the checklist.\
\
[00:29:16.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, definitely a checklist. I do want to touch on... We said we get back to accounting systems and digging into that because I think a lot of people hear that. And yes, systems are great, and we have sessions on for bloggers because I fully believe in not having to constantly work because blogging is about living your life, not just blogging about it. But the accounting part probably scares them, even though we've talked about the chaos, money framework and whatnot. But if we can touch on accounting systems and where to get started, what to look at, because like you said, it could be a spreadsheet, it could be a tool, it could be... So we can just dig a little deeper there. I think that would be great.\
\
[00:29:58.660] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That is such a good reminder. Absolutely. I always recommend if you have no system at all, if you've never really tried to get organized, if this is your very first year that you have to file self-employment taxes or have to worry about taking care of your blog because you made some money, which congratulations, that's amazing. But once you make your first $400, that's when self-employment tax starts kicking in. It doesn't take that long to get to that $400 mark. So how do we get organized and build that accounting system? I always recommend people just start with the Schedule C. So that tax form that you attached to your individual tax return, the Schedule C where you report all of your income and expenses from your business, already has categories for you to sort things by. That is a really good starter chart of accounts. Chart of accounts, all that means is just what categories am I paying attention to? What areas are important to my business? What is it important for me to track? That's a great way to get started, and you can just put that in a spreadsheet, and that can be the accounting system to start.\
\
[00:31:05.700] - Katherine Pomerantz\
If you want to level up, and I highly recommend you level up because again, I don't want you to just work for the government, you're working for yourself. What is important to you to know as a business owner? For income, for example, they only want your total. The government doesn't care where you made it from. They just want to know the total amount because they just want their cut. But you need to know your different income streams. So what did you make from affiliate income maybe? Are you freelancing? Are you bringing in ad revenue? Yeah, exactly. So all of those different things you might want to break up. And eventually you might even want to narrow down. Wait, I'm making so much money from affiliate income and not a lot from these others. I'm going to cut them out. Because you were able to break up your revenue streams, you were able to really see that in real time. That's one example for income. Expenses as well is another example, is the government has those basic expense categories. But for example, there is your advertising category is going to be insanely big. I mean, that's going to be your biggest category because it's all your website.\
\
[00:32:06.540] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's where you put a lot of your online tools. That can be like, or a lot of software. I'll just gets filed in their office supplies. Or marketing. I know from... Yeah.\
\
[00:32:15.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I feel.\
\
[00:32:15.750] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Like- Yeah, or marketing to the key.\
\
[00:32:16.660] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
-or marketing to the key. Because you've got the email marketing software, you've got any ads you're going to do on social networks. You've got social media, automation tools. You've got, yeah. Yeah, and with marketing and course education, I feel like, are my biggest.\
\
[00:32:34.210] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yes, continuing education and marketing are massive expenses for online business owners. They're also the most controllable, however. So if you break those down into, Okay, here's what I spent on my website, not just for hosting it, but any design, any tech, any plugins. This is what I spend on advertising, and this is what I spent on advertising on separate platforms. That's going to give you a lot better data about what was effective, what was really helpful to me. If I spent a ton of revenue on Facebook ads and I did not have an accompanying thing on my Facebook affiliate thing that I was plugging, maybe either improve the ad or don't spend as much. That is not the best use of your business. That's not where it's resonating with your audience. Again, you can't make those decisions unless you've got it organized. So the fun part is the accounting system where you can automate a lot of this. And I am a huge believer in tech. As much as I was giving you a hard time earlier, the cloud is amazing. The internet is amazing. It is a gift, and we should all be happy about it, which since you're all bloggers, I don't have to convince you.\
\
[00:33:42.130] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So there's a lot of really good tools for just getting started with a lot of stuff, getting implemented. I do think Quickbook self-employed is a decent program to get started. It will auto-pull a lot of things from your bank and just enter it into there. Now you have to be able to set up your chart of accounts and a lot of things like that, but that's a great first tool. I also recommend Tiller. Tiller organizes things into spreadsheets, and there's no reason you can't hook that up to your business bank account and have yourself sort things. So it's still using spreadsheets, and you can still customize it as much as you want because it's a spreadsheet, but it has that automatic bank feed poll feature. Both of those are paid tools. Okay, I am biased, but I do think this is an area that's worth investing in because it saves you time.\
\
[00:34:32.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And again- I think, Tiller is like, $60 a year. Quickbook self-employed is $10. Now I will say because I was on Quickbook self-employed for a long time, I don't know that lets you do the chart of accounts.\
\
[00:34:46.800] - Katherine Pomerantz\
No.\
\
[00:34:47.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Actually. And the downside of that is if you change, like I changed to Quickbooks online last year, is it won't pull stuff in. So if you're starting a Quickbook self-employed because it's a lesson I learned, it's probably not going to be where you end up, and you're going to have to then start over a bit. So it might be worth the extra seven dollars or whatever to invest in QuickBooks online and have something that can grow with you if this is something, depending on where you're at and how much you're earning, things like that.\
\
[00:35:23.020] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's a really, really good point, Liz. That's a really good point. Yeah, QuickBook self-employed is a great starter program, as I said. If you have a lot of business and personal expenses mixed, actually, that's probably the only program that can really handle that. But I recommend, even if you're not making much money, having a separate bank account for just your blogging income or just your side hustle income, because that's also just going to help you stay organized.\
\
[00:35:47.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And when we say separate account, because I feel like this is another misnomer, it doesn't have to be like a formal business checking account. Even if it's just a separate personal account, that is better than nothing. Because you're not able to get a business account until you've registered a state or an LLC or some other entity. There's a little more that goes into it, although it's really not that hard to register as an LLC, and your taxes are still pretty much the same. But we go over that in our other, I think, in some of our legal sessions. But anyway, but yeah, so I just wanted to point that out.\
\
[00:36:23.720] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yeah. No, that is again, a great caveat is that you do not have to have a separate business account for this. You can do it separate checking account. I just recommend the separation. A lot of people actually think it's required. The IRS does not care. They will do their due diligence to get their cut. It's separation for you. Again, it helps you do your accounting system. It makes things faster for you, and that is ultimately what I care about. So two very simple ways to get started with an accounting system. It's just have everything in a separate account and have all that account data downloaded automatically into a spreadsheet with Tiller, which I think is one of the best tools to get started. Or if you are a little bit more serious and you really want to dig into the money mapping stuff, I think QuickBooks is a great tool. Things like Fresh Books also can help because it has some business expense stuff versus income stuff. Dubsato has a little bit of bookkeeping as well. I don't end up keeping a lot of my clients on those, but also I work with people who like our business, businesses.\
\
[00:37:26.240] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That may or may not be useful advice for you right now. So related to that, actually, where if you do want to dive deeper and want to learn more, I recommend you pick up the All Access Pass because in the All Access Pass, I have offered everyone a free one-hour session with me. So if you want to learn more, this is obviously very customizable to you and again to your goals because you got to start with step two, that mission, vision, values. We need to know that to get started. You can pick up a free hour with me and I'm happy. I know it's tax season. I know that there are questions. And it's... I don't normally give away hours for free. I normally charge for it. But if you pick up the all access pass, I would be happy to see, to hear from you. So you're going to get a free strategy session with me doing there. So if this is something that you do want this deep dive and you see the CEO checklist and you're like, I'm ready to get bigger or I'm ready to just plan ahead or I'm really- Are you.\
\
[00:38:19.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Trying to get in?\
\
[00:38:20.920] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yes, exactly. You're like, My vision is to have this whole blogging empire. Hit me up. I'd be happy to discuss how you can make this easier on yourself from day one.\
\
[00:38:32.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, and that's just incredibly generous offer for all access pass holders to definitely get the all access pass to take advantage of that. Because I've definitely paid her for many hours of her time, and I could tell you it's worth it. So yeah, I mean, any final words of advice for attendees?\
\
[00:38:57.110] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's such a great question, and I should have thought of something. No, I think honestly, you have now seen a bird's eye view of my whole system. It's taking me years to develop, and it helps a lot. I hear constantly from clients who are just so relieved and feel so powerful and have really taken back ownership of their business. So if you want final words, and I would just say, you know what? Go relisten to the embrace chaos portion, give yourself some grace, and try to make taxes a little bit more fun this year. Yes.\
\
[00:39:28.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Thank you, and yeah, that's... And remember, blogging is supposed to be fun. So don't let anything- Yeah, blogging is supposed to be fun. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much, Katherine. I appreciate you taking the time. I want you to go grab the freebie. It's down below. Get that checklist. I actually probably should get it, even though I've...\
\
[00:39:46.690] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Of course.\
\
[00:39:47.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Just to give you a review and repeat, which is step eight, right? Grab the all access pass to get an hour with Katherine too. So thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time.\

[00:00:12.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm really excited to welcome back Katherine Pomerantz. Katherine and I go way back, I think almost like 10 years now at this point. It was like, I think in 2016, I think in San Diego that we met. Maybe it was even before.\
\
[00:00:23.880] - Katherine Pomerantz\
No, I think it was. No, it was Dallas, but that was 2016.\
\
[00:00:28.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Maybe 2017. I've actually known you quite a long time, which is crazy. Super excited to have you back. I know you've got some stuff prepared for us. I'm excited to learn. I'm excited to ask questions. I'm going to let you lead the way.\
\
[00:00:43.420] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Well, thank you so much. I have a little slideshow just because I'm going to go through some jargony things. There's things for people to visually follow along with us. I'll get that started. Why don't we start there? Then we can do the official intro. Okay, are you seeing my- Yes. Okay, great. Seeing the slides. Fabulous. Okay. Right. Yeah, I am excited to be back. This is my third Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Every year, we find a new and unique way to approach taxes and money. Every year, it feels like they make it even more valuable. We had discussed, How should we do it again this year? I decided, Let's do an interview because today, I am not going to go easy on anyone listening. I am going to talk through some advanced tax strategy, tax planning stuff. Even if you're a beginner, but you were like, This is a topic that's really interesting to me, you're going to want to know strategy strategy sooner rather than later. I'll show why you want to start mapping these ahead of time in just a minute. But for now, know that Liz is here to not only be your summit host and beautiful guide, but she can be your stand-in.\
\
[00:01:56.930] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Liz promised today to ask me all the questions for everybody.\
\
[00:02:01.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I will because I don't shy away from questions.\
\
[00:02:03.790] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Absolutely great. There's an immense value in getting to do this live because I am an actual financial expert. This is not a Google search. This is not going to be general tax information that's going to be in a blog post, which are fabulous, by the way, and I support all of my bloggers who are talking about money or tax topics because that's a great starting point. But the advantage of when you get to do a summit or get to do things like this is that you tailor the specific details to your exact situation. The year is 2025. We're going to be talking about the US tax code. We're going to be talking to people who are scaling a blog and side hustle income, maybe stretching to making this full-time income, maybe stretching to building a team. There is a great opportunity to discuss this in a way that is going to be really useful. For everyone watching, trust that Liz has got you if you've got more questions. If you have a If there's additional questions, I will make sure I'm in that Facebook group for everybody to contact us after the replay. It's a very, very bold claim.\
\
[00:03:11.040] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Should I actually introduce myself? We didn't actually do that part, right?\
\
[00:03:14.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, probably a good idea. They might want to know how you know all this fun stuff.\
\
[00:03:20.250] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Right. How can I claim all this expertise? My brief intro. I am Katherine Pomerantz. I am an actress turned accountant and money coach. That's important to my story because as an artist, I really struggled with money. I was working three, sometimes four jobs, and I could barely pay my bills. I realized, finally, hard work was not my problem. I was working 60, 80 hours a week, and I still wasn't making enough money. I also, being an artist, got to see a lot of weird mindsets around money. Famously, the serving artist mentality is a thing. That's a true stereotype for a reason. But I grew up with a diversity of socioeconomic backgrounds in my family and my friends grew up at my school. I got to see different examples of why... How much money you earn doesn't necessarily mean you're It's a correspond to how much you're happy or how well you are feeling about it. I knew I was working really hard, but I still wasn't making enough money. I knew that having different types of amounts of money wasn't necessarily corresponding to how we experienced it. I was like, Okay, there's something about money I don't know, something I haven't been taught.\
\
[00:04:36.180] - Katherine Pomerantz\
If I could figure that out, I think I could help a lot of people. This eventually became the money storyteller method. When I started to study money, I fell in love with it. I launched my own accounting firm about a year after having that thought of, I wonder if I could figure out money and help people. I was like, A year later, I am running my own accounting firm. I'm doing business taxes. We're doing bookkeeping, we're doing all the things. I I was so good at it so quickly because of my storyteller background, because I come at it from an artist's perspective. Money at its heart is like any human language, like choreography, color, like design, all of that is a way of taking abstract concepts, making sense of our chaos, and telling stories. Humans invented money. We cannot help it. It's how we make sense of things. When money does that, it helps us make sense of how are we using our resources. What is our plans for the future. These are all the reasons we have forecast. Now, today, we're going to deep dive on taxes, which is one holistic part of this framework.\
\
[00:05:39.380] - Katherine Pomerantz\
But here's the core message of that that's going to be really helpful in making advanced tax strategies feel easy, and dare I say it, fun, is money is a creative language. We can use that to map out and then measure and then actually achieve ambitious goals. Storytelling is going to be our inroad to making financial stuff easier and more fun. When we can do that, money is going to become a teammate in our story. As we grow this blog, instead of working so, so, so, so hard and maybe scraping out some money, money can be put to work for you. Money can work hard on your behalf. I have helped hundreds of clients one-on-one through my firm, and I have taught thousands of students in workshops just like that. Liz already said how long we've known each other, almost 10 years. I've been running my business. I've been working on the same amount of time. I have helped so many people master this idea using this method. This is where I'd like to start today. This is you. This is your blog. Take a minute and remember, you started this blog for a reason, and you control everything about this blog.\
\
[00:06:50.930] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You're going to control everything about how it makes money and how you're going to spend that money. In every moment, even if we can't immediately change our external circumstances, you're only making so much money, you only have so many hours in the day, we can choose how to think about and therefore how to use that money. That's what I want us to do. When we start talking taxes, what is your money story? This is where I want you to start. Just what happened to you this year? How did you make income? How did you spend it? Did you have a significant life event, like a birth or a marriage? How did you invest and save? This is how you should start getting ready for tax season every year because money is going to affect every single area of your life, and taxes are affected by every area of your money. Start by telling me your story, and then I can help you find the exact scenarios that are going to give you the most tax savings. Now, I know I said earlier, blog posts are just going to give you general information, but this is how you can start taking the most time to look for taking control of that story and doing your own research.\
\
[00:08:02.300] - Katherine Pomerantz\
If I know my exact scenarios, if I know my story, I can then go search for resources like blog posts, like experts like me who can do the taxes for me. I can tell that story and I can filter the information they're giving me so that I can apply it to myself and win. Does that make sense, Liz, before I just keep running past?\
\
[00:08:22.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, no, I think it does.\
\
[00:08:24.690] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Okay, great. Fabulous. If you're watching this recording, you can hit pause and literally just start listing out your life events at this point, and you've done everything you need to to prep for this year's coming tax season. This is coming out at the start of the year, start of tax season. This is everything you need to get organized. You get nothing else out of today's training. This is already on the a wildly successful. I'm so proud of you. But I'm going to give you a little bit more. I am going to give you because here's a question that I get a lot with clients, especially when they're self-employed. It's like, What do I focus on first? Is it important to get my bookkeeping handled? Is it important to set aside tax savings? Is it important to When should I build my cash buffer? When should I reinvest in my business? When do I need to hire a tax repairer? Do I need to do a retirement account? How much? I could be paying down debt, or I could be investing in my blog, or I could be saving for retirement, or I could pay myself.\
\
[00:09:11.390] - Katherine Pomerantz\
What do I focus on when? No matter when you're starting this process or with how much money you're starting this process, I have a flowchart that I like to take people through. Ten steps to tax strategy. If you do these 10 things in this order, it has some advantages. In one, it scales up by level of complexity, so I have the easiest things first. If you nail these easier things, great, you're ready for some of the things that are a little bit more difficult. It also will then scale up in terms of when is it necessary based on how much money you're making. If you're just getting started, pay lots of attention to the first step. If you feel like you already have a handle on it, start doing the work you need to do to do some of the middle steps. If you're in it and you're like, Okay, I've done all these things that I have no idea what step six is, Great. Time to do some research or find an expert and then keep going down the flowchart. This flowchart is not a one-year tech strategy. This is a lifetime tech strategy.\
\
[00:10:10.620] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Keep this recording, buy the upgrades so that you can get the recordings. Use this for the rest of time, the rest of the time you're running your blog, to really take advantage of the income streams that you're going to be building for yourself to make sure you're saving as much money as possible and keeping as much as possible for your family and for the reason you started this blog and wanted to monetize it in the first place. Excited? Ready?\
\
[00:10:36.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes.\
\
[00:10:37.030] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Okay, thank you. I'm always way more excited than everyone else is talking.\
\
[00:10:40.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
You know I love talking money. You know I'm actually excited.\
\
[00:10:43.960] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I know. You're formerly a lawyer in a previous life, so you're very good at that, or you understand it's dry, but we need it, right? Okay, so tax strategy flowchart, 10 steps. What are these Ninja moves for you to get started on your tax planning? Create a money map. What is a money map? A money map is simply an outline of that story. Every good story needs a treasure map. This is what is going to point us in the right direction of where we want the story to go. These are all the things that have happened, and this is what I want to have happen in the future. You're running a blog. You want to make as much profit as possible in that blog, and then you want to strategically map out how you're going to split that profit between tax savings, between paying between saving for retirement so that you are taking care of short term and long term tax strategies, et cetera. But before you do anything else, you just need to have a plan. You just have to have a plan and you have to have a system in order to know, Okay, I'm going to make money, and then I'm going to set aside part of that money to pay my taxes, to pay myself, and to do any other, save up for a house, pay down debt, do retirement.\
\
[00:11:54.540] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Map out what you want with your money. Then build some cash saving. This is This is often called an emergency fund, if you've ever looked at personal finance stuff before. But this is important even as you grow a blog, and even if your blog is very small, because your blog has recurring expenses just to stay alive. You've got your website, your domain subscription, any software that you're using, any tech that you're using when you start building out funnels and ways you actually make money in your blog, anything you're using to make social media and content creation easier. Those cost money. So your blog should start to build its own cash to start paying for its own thing. This is going to help when your blog has low income, but you don't have to keep funneling cash back into it. This is also important for tax strategy because the number one way to reduce your taxes is to pay your taxes on time every time. Where I see the biggest tax troubles start to happen is when people scale their money up and they don't have enough saved and they're not ready for that next big tax bill because they jump tax brackets and now it's more complicated and they have to handle self-employment tax and everything else, and they owe more than they expect.\
\
[00:13:06.240] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Then they end up with a payment plan to the IRS that has penalties and interest that is even harder to get out from under. The number one way to do this is to start a cash savings soon. That never happens to you. Step three, save for retirement. I'm going to get a little preachy here. The reason I was like, I want to learn about money. I want to help a lot of people figure out how money works. Then I started a tax firm. The reason I did that is because taxes is a great gateway drug to actual wealth building. Because all of the habits that make you rich over a lifetime are also a good way to save money on taxes. The government wants you to be wealthy because it only taxes the wealthiest individuals in the US. In the United States, 90% of our taxes is paid by That's only 10% of the population. Wild, but that's just the way that it works with the different tax brackets. Similarly, if you have a lot of money, then the government doesn't have to pay for welfare, for health care, for any of these things that you get credit for.\
\
[00:14:16.010] - Katherine Pomerantz\
The government wants you to be as rich and as happy as possible so you don't become their problem. Now, whether or not this is effective, I'm not here to say. I'm just here to teach you how to play the game. We want to save for retirement because by saving for In our own retirement, the government rewards us by giving us money off of our taxes. As you are starting your blog, you are uniquely in a special position and that you can open up self-employment retirement accounts because they have higher contribution limits than you just being an employee. These are things like a SEP IRA, a SEP IRA, S-E-P-I-R-A, or a Solo 401(k). You can contribute up to $69,000 a year into one of these accounts as opposed to just $23,000 into a regular 401k or $7,000 into a regular IRA. As you grow your income, if you don't want to pay taxes on any of it, fill these retirement accounts. But I'll get to that in a little bit. For now, just start. Just get started and start the habit of, I am saving money on taxes and spending some of my money aside for myself.\
\
[00:15:20.930] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You also, as a self-employed person, have until April 15th to fill up every year, not just the end of the calendar year, like with your employer account. So you have even more to keep maxing out for longer, which is just the [inaudible]. There's been a lot of jargon in the first three steps. Anything I should slow down and ask questions or clarify, Liz?\
\
[00:15:42.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
A couple of things. Okay. First of all, I did not know you could stash that much in a solo 401(k). So there's a lot of different kinds of IRAs, and I know you mentioned a SEP IRA, but there's Roth IRAs, there's non-Roth. Can you just distinguish that one and how it... Because there's so many IRAs. I feel like it's- So many IRAs, yeah. It can be very overwhelming if you don't have a little There's a little bit of knowledge on that.\
\
[00:16:16.320] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's such a good point. Absolutely. There are three types of IRAs that are important for what we're talking about here. There is a traditional IRA, the original, the OG. This is a $7,000 contribution limit right now. You could have a 401(k) at work and still use an IRA. If you have a blog and you could stash aside a little bit of money, that might be a great way to go because any money you put away at a traditional IRA is tax-free. It goes in and you don't pay taxes on it, and then it will grow as it is invested in the IRA. Is that a good quick explanation? Because we can talk also about investing in what that means. We can go.\
\
[00:16:59.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, no, we won't go that deep into it. Correct me if I'm wrong, IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account.\
\
[00:17:05.670] - Katherine Pomerantz\
It does. Yes, that's true. It is an acronym, IRA. There is also a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is different from a traditional IRA, and that money goes in after you pay taxes on it. If I made a dollar, I can deposit 70 cents of it because 30 cents will go to taxes, for example. Then the money as it is in the Roth IRA grows tax-free, and I don't pay taxes when I withdraw the money. In a traditional IRA, I don't pay taxes upfront, but when I'm ready to retire, when I'm ready to use that money, I will pay taxes as I withdraw it. Roth IRAs are a good strategy if you are young or if you know that right now you're in a low-income bracket but are going to have a high-income bracket. My students, especially my med students or my legal students, you will make no money as a resident, but you will have a high salary for the rest of your career. That's a great time to take advantage of a Roth IRA. For my self-employed people, and if you are running a blog and you are wanting to make money off that blog, you are self-employed, you have to balance out self-employment tax and income tax.\
\
[00:18:21.000] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You are going to be in the highest tax bracket of pretty much any taxpayer, even if your income isn't that big When I'm talking about saving for retirement, almost without exception, it's a good time for you to use a traditional IRA or a tax advantage saving account in that way. Roths are good in the years you lose money in your business because your income is negative, so it's a good time to start filling in my Roth. I'm paying low taxes this year because my income is down. That's great. That's when we could take advantage of it. But almost without exception, for my self-employed people here, we want to be looking at tax a free retirement. A SEP IRA is exactly the same as a traditional IRA. They are just as easy to open. You can do them with almost the same, all the same robo advisors. You can do them with like 500 bucks in five minutes nowadays. Wealthfront, Betterment, any of the big investing firms, you can open one. The advantage there is that instead of maxing out at $7,000, it maxes out at 18%, well, it's 25% of your profit in your blog, which on average is 18% of what you actually make because as you put into a step, it's tax-free, so it brings it down.\
\
[00:19:34.290] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So it isn't the full 25. It's a better estimate is 18%. If you're making a couple of $100,000, you would be able to reach that maximum $69,000 limit. Because they're so easy to use and because you can start small, I'd say go for it and set up a SEP IRA right away, especially if you're serious about building up this blog for yourself, because then as your income scales, your limit scales, and you can just keep backing it every year and you're already in the habit of it, and that's great. But if you don't want to get in the weeds, you're not sure about the blog, just open up a traditional IRA and get started there. Helpful?\
\
[00:20:09.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. Thank you for clarifying that.\
\
[00:20:11.790] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yeah, absolutely. We'll throw the solo 401k in in just a minute because that's even better for other reasons. But we're not there yet. We're at the simple stuff. After that, hire a tax preparer. At that stage, the next best thing you can do for your tax strategy is to get somebody like me who's going to be proactively really giving you advice about your exact situation. Because when you add in kids and mortgages and your blog income scales up, there are other things that you might want to start playing with. It's just going to be helpful to have somebody who can keep you up to date. Because the I was going to curse, but I'm not going to curse. The unfortunate thing about the tax code is it changes every year. Sometimes it changes in major ways because the president changes changes, the Congress changes, the administration changes, and they just enact an entirely new tax code. You want somebody in your corner who's going to memorize all those rules for you because if you had all of the knowledge you need to do all the steps really, really well, you'd be running my business, not a blog.\
\
[00:21:17.270] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I don't have a blog, you guys, because the blog is a lot of work. I am busy studying taxes to support my bloggers, not to be a blogger. Let's stay in our lane and see where we enjoy staying. I like taxes a lot more than I like to write, so blogging is not for me. I think that one's pretty straightforward. Becoming an S-corp is the good next step. As you start making in the upper five figures for your blogging income, and I'm not talking just revenue, I'm talking revenue minus expenses, although luckily blogs are not that much expenses in them. You start making $50,000, $100,000, it's time to I start thinking about being an S Corp. I have a tax preparer ahead of the S Corp because an S Corp is a type of business entity that has amazing tax advantages if you run them right, and they have extra compliance to make sure that you're not, making away from paying all that income tax that the IRS wants you to pay. Is it the S Corp strategy, Liz? Yeah.\
\
[00:22:27.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Because there's a difference between, registering with the state as an S Corp versus registering as a different business entity, and then I believe you can opt to be taxed as an S Corp. Is that correct?\
\
[00:22:39.600] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Okay, so that's a great question. An S Corp actually is only a taxable entity. You're A business entity is filed through the state. If you open up a blog, put up some affiliate links, and start making $400 a year, you are a sole proprietor just automatically. You don't need business license, you don't need to be registered. Some states might have different laws about that, but you can just collect money. Then federally, the IRS is like, You're just automatically a sole proprietor. You owe me self-employment taxes on that $400 plus income, whatever. You want to start taking yourself more seriously. You want more legal protection, you go to the state and you register. You can sign up for a DBA, which is just a doing business as and just register the name. You're still a sole proprietor. You can also set up an LLC is a common one. You're a limited liability company for other types of business entities. You could say a partnership or whatever. Well, let's just focus on what- I just wanted to distinguish what you're registered as an entity with the Secretary of State is not necessarily the same as how you're choosing to be taxed.\
\
[00:23:44.790] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yes. An LLC is a very good entity as a business entity because it gives you some legal protection and it allows you to elect a tax entity. Now, automatically, you'll just say a sole proprietor if you do nothing. But when you're ready, when your income is scaled up and you're ready to start saving more money on taxes, you can elect to get tax as an S-Corp. An S-Corp is not a business entity. You're not registered with a state anywhere as an S-Corp. You are registered with the IRS because it's your tax entity. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:24:18.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. Do you need... Okay, so this might be going further than you would normally. An EIN is the business equivalent of a social security number. If you choose to change tax entities, like from Sole proprietor to S Corp, do you have to get a new EIN or does that carry over?\
\
[00:24:35.390] - Katherine Pomerantz\
No, you can carry over the EIN because it's still the same business entity. So you just need to update with the IRS. There's a separate form just to fill out, but the EIN carries over for you. You actually don't need an EIN to be an S Corp, but you do need an EIN to open a business bank account. I didn't put EIN on here somewhere because it's not really a strategy, but it's a really good advice.\
\
[00:24:58.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Sure. Guys, it's free. It takes 15 minutes.\
\
[00:25:01.940] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yeah. The advantage of that is it allows you to not use your social security number everywhere. If you have to go put out a W-9 or fill out legal forms for your business or tax forms for your business, you're not putting out your personal social Social Security number. You're using an employer identification number, but it's a business social security number, basically. See, Liz, this is why I have you on an interview. You got to ask these questions, right?\
\
[00:25:28.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, that's what I'm here for.\
\
[00:25:30.150] - Katherine Pomerantz\
An S Corp pays you a bunch of tax money, which we haven't even gone into the details of how and why that works. But the IRS knows that an S-corp save you a lot of money. There's also a lot of rules about you have to have a reasonable wage. You have to pay yourself wages. You have to run payroll for the first time. Then you have to fill out a totally separate business tax form for the first time. I kid you not. We specialize in S-corps because I specialize in people like this who want to run a blog or make content or be an expert or run a small business, lean and maintain high profits, wonderful freedom-driven lifestyle. That's what we're all trying to do here. S-corps is such a good strategy for that. But the IRS knows you're only electing an S-corps to get around paying taxes. You have to follow a bunch of rules. I kid you not, Liz, I specialize in S Corps. I onboard a lot of them. I'm now repeating myself. But Over 50% of the people who come to me as new clients, we refile because they haven't been doing them right, and they're leaving themselves liable for just mistakes, or they're not getting the tax advantages they think they were getting because they weren't doing it right.\
\
[00:26:43.750] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That's why tax preparators before this, because if you want to be an expert, that's fantastic. At least get somebody to help you set it up right and teach you how to run it. Also, while you wait until step five, be making some serious money before you go through all this extra admin headache. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth it, but that's my personal. Okay. Make sense there? Any way you want to follow up?\
\
[00:27:05.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, that's great.\
\
[00:27:06.800] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Yeah. Anyone who's watching, if you do have more questions, I could literally deep dive on any one of these things for hours. So please ask me to follow up. I'd be thrilled to help you with it. So let's keep going. Save even more for retirement. Circling back around. At step three, if you're already maxing out to $70,000, it was $69,000 a year. Fantastic. I'm so proud of you. You're probably not. Before we get to any other types of strategies, maxing out retirement savings is the number one tax strategy for every person in every type of job at every income level. If you're not doing this first, do this first. Is let's max out your retirement and get as much put away as possible. It is the best way to grow because that money gets invested and it will grow and grow and grow and grow and you're still getting tax advantages. There is nothing else There's a lot of things in the entire tax or financial system that does this well, with some exceptions for health insurance and health savings accounts, but that's not really related specifically to how you're running your blog. We can get to it.\
\
[00:28:14.050] - Katherine Pomerantz\
This also is a good It's a good time to start looking at your solo 401(k) versus a SEP IRA. Certain types of retirement contributions from your business are going to be more tax-advantaged. Some of those are going away in 2025 unless the IRS renews some things, though, or Congress renews some things. I'm not going to get in the weeds about that. We'll see how 2025 shakes out, and then you can all follow up with me, I guess. After this, then we get to the bonus types of tax products or tax-advantaged financial products that people don't really know about. So stabilize your financial foundation with other tax-advantaged things like insurance. So insurance is often a tax deduction, and insurance protects your cash flow. So all of this money that you've been stashing away in your retirement account because you've been following the list I've been giving you, all that money is protected and can actually stay invested and tax-advantaged in a retirement account because you've got insurance to cover emergencies. That's what health insurance is for. Health insurance does not take care of you. Health insurance protects you from bankruptcy. In the Invent, you get cancer and it costs millions of dollars to treat you.\
\
[00:29:26.190] - Katherine Pomerantz\
That is the only reason to have health insurance. Related to that are other types of insurance that you may want as a business owner. Life insurance. Same thing. If I die, I want to help give my family the income that I would have earned for them. That's what life insurance is for. Short and long term disability insurance. If I am running a blog full-time and I'm writing full-time, but I get in a car accident and break my shoulder and can't type for eight weeks, well, does your income just dry up? What happens? I can't meet all these speaking engagements. I have books. I can't deliver on these products I thought I could do. Disability insurance can step in and continue paying your paycheck, even though all these income streams have dried up. Really important for business owners and something very few of them set up for themselves. We also have business insurance, liability insurance, different things like that that you can put in place. This is also when you can start looking at education savings, like through a 529 plan. If you've got kids or if you want to put yourself back into grad school someday, maybe you want to start setting aside tax advantage or money with a tax savings into a special education account to pay for that.\
\
[00:30:32.970] - Katherine Pomerantz\
This is also because you are set up as an S Corp, potentially, when you can start looking at employee benefits through your blog. You work for your blog, you're an employee of your blog and an owner of your blog. There's all sorts of things that you can That's a fun employee benefits that also give you tax advantages, like a dependent care FSA. Again, if you've got kids and you're paying for childcare or summer camp or after-school program, that might be useful. Wellness plans. Wellness plans are in addition to helping you get to You're going to need to pay for health insurance, how you could pay for gym memberships or therapy or acupuncture and things like that. Education reimbursements, not just for saving for tuition, but paying off student loans can be an employee benefit. Then at this level, you're going to want a tax professional because there are different roles depending on the number of employees and if you are considered a highly compensated individual, what you can take as employee benefits, which is FYI, you're going to need to ask somebody about setting it up. But Once it's set up, you just have to file a little couple of extra pieces of paper a year and you get money to yourself tax-free, which is fabulous.\
\
[00:31:40.430] - Katherine Pomerantz\
This is where we start to stabilize that financial foundation. We protect your cash flow with insurance products. We help you set up extra savings for different types of jobs for your money. This is where this stuff comes in. Again, lots of jargon in this step, Liz. You with me?\
\
[00:31:54.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I think we're good.\
\
[00:31:56.090] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Okay, cool. Put your kids on payroll. This is one that you may or may not have heard about, but I know, I know, because I work with the bloggers to make lots of money, that this is something that we end up talking about. Like, Oh, yeah, I put my husband on payroll. Oh, yeah, I put my kids on payroll. This is a really good way to reduce your business income, to reduce your business taxes, but keep money in the family. Bonus point, if you take the money you pay your kids and you invest it into an IRA or a 529 plan for education savings, because then you are doublely not paying taxes on it, which is just the best situation. But you could just pay your kids the cash, too, for various reasons. Again, you'll want to make sure you set this up right. There are some legal things that you need to cross your t's, dot your i's about to do this. This is also... A lot of people ask me about this one before they really need it or they're ready for it, because notice this is number 8 of 10. The first seven is going to do more for your lifelong wealth building and your tax savings, and it's less complicated.\
\
[00:33:03.020] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I think this is a beautiful strategy. I do this several times a year for clients, but let's get to it when we get to it. Okay? Makes sense. Or do you want me to go into your details of how that works?\
\
[00:33:14.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I think that's okay. Because at that point, if they really need the details, they should hopefully be working with someone like you.\
\
[00:33:20.730] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Exactly. Like I said, there's some legal things you got to put in place to make sure you did it right, and it holds up the scrutiny. But then once it's in place, it's like, so... I did this for a client once, and we took... Because she had four kids, we reduced her taxable income by over 40 grand every year for the next 10 years. It's amazing. It's just a cool loophole that the IRS has made. It's not even a loophole. It's a rule that they did to benefit the small business owners, which are so many of them are family-run companies. Let's know the rules and let's use the rules that are built to help us. Again, as I said, at the very top of this, 90% of the taxes are paid by 10% of the population, and small business owners are in the highest tax bracket because of business taxes and self-employment taxes and payroll taxes and all the things that you pay. You're a big tax payer to take advantage of the breaks that they give you to help. The IRS knows that, but they also know they want you to pay yourself well, live well, so give you some things that you can reduce.\
\
[00:34:22.230] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Okay, almost done. Nine, give to charity. At this point, hopefully you're making good money. Let's spread that money around. Spread that wealth around. Let's find ways to invest back in your community. Find ways to invest where you want to see. That's a tax deduction. This is often overlooked as ways to reduce taxes and feel like your money is being put to work for you. It doesn't just have to be in your business. It doesn't just have to be in a savings account. We can give it to other people to get it to work, and you can take a tax deduction for it. Love this one. Okay, final one, number 10, make an estate plan. Look at all the work you just did in this flowchart. Look at all the money you will have saved up in a retirement account. You are now running a blog. You've probably been running it for a year or two and you're making good money. You now have a business that is an asset that is going to that's something you could sell. What's your exit strategy for this blog? It's something you don't want to keep running it. How do you want to divvy up all of this money that's invested in a retirement account in case it outlives you?\
\
[00:35:27.570] - Katherine Pomerantz\
You've been giving to charity. Do you want that to continue? Do you You have all of these different ways that you could pass that money on to other people or, again, to exit your business and still make money on it. This is where estate planning and exit planning and all the legal details, this is where this starts to come in. Things to pay attention to at this level. If you're at this level, Roth IRAs come back into play and maybe turning from rolling over from a traditional back into a Roth because then you pay the taxes on it, not your heirs. Life insurance, Life insurance payout, not taxable to your heirs. Gift taxes are important. So maybe you start giving money away under that gift tax threshold early before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to put to see it before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to see it before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to see Trust. There's lots of... I'm not even going to touch Trust because that's not my specialty. But there's a lot of stuff you can do through Trust to help make sure the money goes where you want it to do.\
\
[00:36:25.180] - Katherine Pomerantz\
And then, like I said, with exit planning, your business assets and your IP, your intellectual property. Bloggers, especially, who have all of this content, this brand, these funnels, these systems. These are things people will pay for. Even if you're only making a few hundred thousand with it, that's money somebody else may want to take and run with. Do you have that stuff trademarked? Do you have those systems built, those SOPs in place? Have you trained somebody to run it for you? Are you ready to sell it and then start the next blog or start the next self-employed project or travel for a while until you find out what you want to do next? That's where we can start looking at these things here. I mentioned that even as a beginner, it's good to know this flow because of this number 10. When you begin with the end in mind and you can work backwards, you can start thinking about what you're Thinking about, Oh, this could be part of my business asset someday. This could be part of my exit plan someday. Making sure I'm saving for retirement and knowing as I make money, I need to be setting stuff aside and planning on this and knowing I need to start hiring this help to make sure that I actually have the experience I want to have, knowing what that flow looks like means you're going to already be planning and assimilating information and finding the right people.\
\
[00:37:42.350] - Katherine Pomerantz\
When the time has come to pull the trigger, it feels easy. It feels like, yes, this is natural. I know it's coming. I've thought about it. I put the pieces in place. My foundation was there from the get-go. I am ready to go. Those are my 10 steps. At this point, we jump to the Q&A. Liz, what's can I share? What do we need to go into more detail about?\
\
[00:38:03.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
What I'm wondering is if you have an example money map, because I feel like that's the most abstract of all the steps you shared. If there's an example of one that people would look at and be like, Oh, that's what she means by money map. Yes.\
\
[00:38:20.940] - Katherine Pomerantz\
In the resources that I gave as part of the Speaker, I gave my tax worksheet. Actually, because this is recorded, do you want me to pull it up and show? Sure. Yeah. Okay. Let me just pull it up and show you guys real fast. Because I gave you want to see one of my money maps, and you just have it.\
\
[00:38:49.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And the links guys will be included on this page.\
\
[00:38:51.850] - Katherine Pomerantz\
So this is my easy tax worksheet. I'm going to share my screen now. All you have to do is drop your email and you'll get this link and you can make a copy yourself. But here on the business PnL is a great example of a money map. And I have a little video. I have here on this thing a little walkthrough video that explains how to use this thing. But I'm just going to scroll down and focus on, okay, great, here's all my income, here's all my expenses. Oh, look, exactly what Katherine talked about of mapping out what I want to do. Here's all the money I made this month on my blog. Here's what I'm going to save for taxes. Here's what I'll invest back into my blog. Here's what I'm going to put into retirement. Again, I'm going to get on my high horse about that one for you all. Here's what's left over to pay myself. This is something you can customize for yourself. I'm giving you this template to help organize. I mean, you've got other organizational things here. Again, I got a video explanation for it, so I won't waste your...\
\
[00:39:42.990] - Katherine Pomerantz\
I won't double do it here. But this is what I mean when I talk about money mapping is I've mindfully made a plan. I know I'm going to follow all the 10 steps Katherine gave me. I know I'm going to want to set aside cash savings into my blog. That was step two. I know I'm going to want to start saving for retirement. That was step three and step six. Now, I'm going to map it out every month how I divide up that cash, and I know I'm going to get as much tax savings as possible, as much lifelong wealth building as possible. It feels so organized and feels so good.\
\
[00:40:15.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I love this. I like it a lot. I'm probably going to make copy myself.\
\
[00:40:20.110] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Please do. It's one of my coaching templates. I use it in my accounting firm. We give it to real clients. These are the real things we do to like, Hey, organize it this way because it makes preparing your tax forms as easy as possible. So my gift to everybody, I would love for you all to win. We're from the states. Yes.\
\
[00:40:37.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Definitely go grab that, you guys. Katherine, thank you so much for coming back. I really appreciate it. Anything else you want to say?\
\
[00:40:44.970] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Not at all. Like I said, I'll be in Facebook. My contact info is going to be shared. You grab the text worksheet. Please, genuinely, if you have follow-up questions, do not hesitate to reach out with me. I think a lot of times people are afraid to talk to speakers. But because I approach this on that money story method, I know, I know. Because I've helped thousands of people with this at this point. It only works if we can really customize it to what you want, to your blog, to your life, to your goals. So truly, It's okay to ask me a question if that gets you started in the right direction. I would really like to support you guys in that. I really hope that you keep these 10 flowcharts for lifelong tax building. Truly, that's all I want for today. So thank you, Liz, for letting me get to do that and share that.\
\
[00:41:31.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
You're very welcome, guys. Go check her out.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.540] - Katherine Pomerantz\
Welcome, Blogger Breakthrough Summit 2024. This is a shockingly simple method for better money habits. I'm Katherine Pomerantz. I want to give a special welcome to all of the business owners watching today. Wait, hold on. Did Katherine say business owners? Surely she meant bloggers, right? No, this is the advanced track. This session in particular is for bloggers ready to take themselves seriously. What do I mean? Well, imagine. Your audience is growing consistently, with more readers and more followers every day, followers who are raving fans and want to buy from you. And you are leading and managing an efficient team that you can delegate admin and busy work to, and that are going to help you scale to multi-six and multi-seven figure sales. And your blog doesn't need you to operate every day, so you have plenty of time to take a real vacation. You can take care of your family. You can scale those profit margins. And you're buying homes. You're sending your kids to dream schools, and you're having once-in-a-lifetime experiences with profit from your blog. You're paying yourself a real salary and you're saving for a real retirement. This is not a dream. \
\
[00:01:30.010] - Katherine\
This is not a dream, and it's also not the experience of just like a few lucky individuals, okay? This is what it's like to have a successful business. And so many bloggers are struggling to create this for themselves even though blogging is a proven and really good business model. You have low overhead, you're very adaptable, and you can switch gears really easily, right? Because bloggers don't think like business owners. So, today's session is for you if you are ready to take yourself seriously as a business owner. You're ready to experience all of these incredible results. So, you're already creating or finding products to sell, or you are pitching strategic partners who are going to pay you. You're committed to growing not just your audience, but also those sales. This session is for you if you're willing to invest not just your time, but also your money. And this is for you if you are ready to receive a big return on that investment. I'm Katherine Pomerantz, as I mentioned. I'm an actress turned accountant and I am a money coach for creative business owners. Yeah, you heard that right too. Actress turned accountant and a money coach.\
\
[00:02:46.110] - Katherine\
My personal story is really interesting, and I will share more about that in a minute. But first, how many people today want to make more money? Yeah, raise your hand. I mean, I know I can't see you, but I can imagine, raise your hand. And how many people know how to make that happen? Yeah, do you think that working more hours or maybe more productivity is going to help you make more money? Be honest, raise your hand. It's okay. Do you think new ideas or a new strategy is what's going to help you make more money? Do you think more readers or more subscribers or more page views or whatever, right? Do you think more revenue is going to make you more money? This is what most business coaches will tell you. You just need more work, more strategies, more audience, and you're going to end up with more money. But this is a complete lie. I don't say that to be rude, the facts back me up. Most people work a steady job for 40 hours a week. Most people work hard and then eventually they retire. But most people in retirement are still struggling.\
\
[00:03:50.930] - Katherine\
In America, where I work, the statistics are pretty bleak. 56% of Americans think it is impossible for them to save enough for them to retire. In Australia, the numbers get worse. They carry more personal debt on average in Australia. So, 82% of people in Australia think it's impossible for them to retire comfortably. And in the EU, where you don't have to save for your own retirement, but you have a pension or a government stipend that will help that you can live off of in your retirement? Well, famously, a lot of countries in the EU, particularly France, in particular England to the UK, they're having a lot of protests and they're having a lot of unrest, and they have for years now because those pension plans are running out of money. Clearly, working hard your whole life does not guarantee money. Most Americans, on average, are going to earn $1.7 million in their lifetime. So, where does all that money go? Why don't they have any left? Okay, so more strategies, right? A new idea. Clearly, that's going to be the secret. It'll help you make more money. Well, how many of us have ever hired a coach, or bought a course, or read a book and followed all the steps, but it still didn't seem to work the way you thought it would?\
\
[00:05:07.130] - Katherine\
Yeah, I will raise my hand. I definitely have. I have paid thousands of dollars before and ended up with nothing to show for it. And the sad truth is that behind every business is a new idea and is often a great strategy. But 65% of businesses are still going to fail in less than 10 years. And 82% of the businesses that fail, the reason they give is cash flow. Even when they're profitable, they can still run out of cash. So, where is that money going? Okay, more sales. Surely more revenue will help you keep more money. Well, as I mentioned, I am a small business accountant and a coach. So, I have seen behind the scenes of hundreds of six-figure and even seven-figure businesses. I have seen people who make a lot of money. And I have also seen someone who made that first seven-figure launch with her online course, but did not have enough cash that month to make payroll, and they ended up further in debt to cover the difference. I have listened as someone confessed to me that they run an eight-figure business - eight figures, tens of millions of dollars in revenue - but they have zero dollars in their retirement account, and they're terrified because they don't know how to do anything except keep working despite being in their 60s.\
\
[00:06:24.390] - Katherine\
I have supported a new mom who went back to work the day after giving birth because, even though she had four employees, a business manager, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracted client work, her business didn't have the systems to work without her. She couldn't take her maternity leave. And I have helped not one, not two, not three, but over a dozen different clients who had tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt from the year they started their business. They just charged everything to their cards, and they trusted all that money was going to come back to them. But now, three, four, and sometimes five years later, they still hadn't paid any of it off despite making well over six figures a year. They did earn a return on that investment, but they still couldn't get rid of the debt. Clearly, more sales do not automatically equal financial success. Now, okay, I want to pause. Got a little heavy there, right? And it might sound like I'm shaming everybody because I'm telling you all these scary statistics and stories about money, and that is not my intention at all. I am putting this first because I want you to understand, if you take nothing else away from my workshop today, that these common solutions - more hard work, another great strategy, or more readers - these alone are not going to make you money.\
\
[00:07:44.280] - Katherine\
I'm sure everyone today is already hardworking, they're already smart and have great ideas, and they already have readers who love them. You would not be on the advanced track of this Blogging Summit if you were not those things, frankly. So, what are the real problems here? Most of the content creators who find me, they're making between $50,000.00 and $200,000.00 a year. They have figured out how to create an audience and how to make sales, and they've made a good job for themselves. But they don't know how to take that blog and turn it into a business. So, they're experiencing ineffective time management, all of the daily tasks of growing their blog, and they're starting to feel overwhelmed. They are working so hard and getting little results. Or maybe you're having difficulty in delegating and building an effective team. Can you afford that VA? Can you afford your next hire? And how do you know if paying for them is going to help your growth or if it's just another expense? You're experiencing feast and famine cycles in your numbers. That's a really common one, inconsistent growth. The audience and the revenue go up and down, up and down.\
\
[00:08:50.860] - Katherine\
Algorithms change, consumer preferences change, and you're starting to feel burned out because you're just along for the ride. And you have difficulty in understanding and managing finances. Most often, this looks like struggling to manage expenses, uncertainty about what to invest in marketing and advertising, what strategies are going to work for you, and uncertainty about what products you need to create, and how do I price these products competitively. And so often, the content creators who find me, they've already tried one of the things we've mentioned. They already work hard and they just keep working hard and they just think after this project or after this time period, then everything's going to be set up, it's finally going to be done, and I can just relax as the money just comes in. Or they research or they attend summits like this, and maybe they ask their friends or they hire a coach and they come up with new ideas to try. Or they just focus in, nothing else. I'm just going to focus on growth and revenue. I'm just going to hyper-focus here and everything else is less important and everything else is going to work out if I can just keep getting bigger.\
\
[00:09:54.600] - Katherine\
But this doesn't really fix any of these things because all of the things that are actually stressing you out: time management, overwhelm and overwork, team difficulties, inconsistent growth, financial instability. These are all symptoms. They are not the problem. They are symptoms of people who are avoiding their money. Think about it. If the goal is to make more money, then why doesn't the solution involve our money? And it totally does. So, I call this making money your teammate. Yeah, that sounds goofy. But as a business accountant, I can truly diagnose almost any problem in your life or business by looking at your finances. I'll give you a couple of examples. I had a client who ran an online boutique. She was making 30K, and often 40K a month. But I took one look at her balance sheet where owner's pay is listed, and I said, 'You don't value yourself enough.' And this client, I will never forget it, she just froze. It was like, deer in the headlights, like baby deer, I'm in danger, just frozen on this Zoom call. And eventually she just very quietly asked, 'How do you know that?' Because in the four years, she had been running her business.\
\
[00:11:15.030] - Katherine\
And despite making $30,000.00 a month, she was paying herself almost nothing. Percentage-wise, it was so tiny. So, I pointed that out. Every dollar she was making was immediately going to somebody else or something else, and she was keeping none of it for herself. And this prompted a really good conversation with this client. She admitted, and it just all came out in a rush like, no, she didn't value herself. This was a lifelong struggle for her, and she's made a lot of progress, but clearly, this was still a strong influence over her actions. And her money told me that. I had another client, a podcaster and a blogger this time. I had a pretty big one, although I won't name names. I took one look at his PNL, his profit and loss report, and I told him, 'You have to get less conflict avoidant.' He just laughed. He's like, 'I mean, I don't disagree with you, but what makes you say that?' Right? He had sponsored posts every month. But he was losing money on every post he put on his blog because he wasn't negotiating a higher rate. He just took whatever the first thing they said was.\
\
[00:12:21.110] - Katherine\
And his team had expanded. His blog was doing well. And so he was paying people more to set up these posts than he was making on the posts. And he had no idea because he didn't know how to ask for his money. And so, most of us, we don't really know how money works, right? I'm not shaming those clients. They were doing nothing wrong. They were clearly very successful, but they just didn't know how to engage their money in the right way to get them the information they needed. Because we aren't taught this in school, and it's considered rude to talk about money. We also don't learn very much from our parents or our friends. Even if it is discussed, there's a really good chance that the person talking to you is also not an expert in money, and so the information you're getting isn't very good. I'm going to let you in a little secret today. This is lifted straight from my Unstoppable program. I am giving you this for free. Money can be your teammate in building the life and business you really want. You can assign money jobs just like any other member of your team, and money will never tire and it will never stop working on that job.\
\
[00:13:26.930] - Katherine\
It even has the power to create more of itself. Money makes money, right? Have you heard that before? What's more? Money is a really good teammate. Not only does it never get tired, it's a good communicator. It will give you regular updates about its progress and how close it is to achieving the goals you set for it. And money is not afraid, to be honest with you, so you can trust what it's saying. It will tell you when things are stuck or when things are not working very well, and it will tell you where you need to focus your energy to improve. Do you know how to use money like that? I didn't. I didn't. Remember, no one teaches this in school, and not everyone, actually very few people, have rich friends or parents or successful business owner acquaintances who are going to teach you that either. I used to really struggle with money. Money was not my teammate. It was the greatest source of stress and fear in my life. As I mentioned, formerly, I was an actress. It's probably more accurate to say I was a performer because I wasn't really interested in film.\
\
[00:14:31.500] - Katherine\
I wanted to be a choreographer and a director. I was a modern dancer, as you can see here. And I like the symbolic and weird artsy things. Much to everyone's surprise, including my own, I was very serious about my career but did decide to get married really young. My husband wanted to go get a PhD. I wanted to support him, so we moved to small town in Oklahoma, which is not the best place to support a full-time career in the arts. Not a lot going on in a small town in Oklahoma, but I tried. I worked three or four jobs to fill in the gaps. I worked 60 to 80 hours a week, and I drove all over the state to go work here, work here, work here, audition there, go do this, and all of that effort. I was so proud when I would bring home $1,500.00 a month. Yeah, $1,500.00 a month. Remember, my husband was a student. I was the primary breadwinner in my family at this point. So, we were stressed about money all the time. I mean, there just wasn't enough of it. I had no idea how I could get more of it.\
\
[00:15:37.210] - Katherine\
I was already working four jobs. I could not work harder. I noticed also that all of my friends and my colleagues and my mentors were doing the same things. That statistic I mentioned earlier, 56% of Americans don't feel like they can save enough for retirement. Yeah, that's more than half of all Americans. So, over half of the people you know are also struggling like this. So, I just thought, 'Wait, okay, if I can figure out how money works because clearly, I am missing something. There's something about this system that nobody told me. If I could figure that out, then I could help a lot of people.' So, I just started spending money. I listened to books, I read podcasts, I took courses, and I completely fell in love. Only a year later, I had started my own accounting firm for small business owners. And I was really good at it, really good at it, you guys. My business grew really, really, really rapidly. And a couple of years into my business, I started to notice another trend. I had some clients who were crushing it. Every month, they would take the numbers I gave them, right?\
\
[00:16:44.730] - Katherine\
Because I was doing the tax strategies. I was organizing their books, so I could give them a lot of information. They would take that information and they would go just crush their goals. But then I had other clients that had the same organization, the same strategies, and everything just stayed really chaotic with them. Even when things changed externally, internally, they were always still messy about it. I started to get really curious about that. There's something that my chaotic clients need that isn't getting organized. They were organized. I was doing it for them. But there was still something about their experience with money that needed to change. Clearly, there was something about money I still hadn't yet figured out. I started to get curious about that next. And then I was like, 'Hold on, my own experience with money is really weird. How did I go from this blonde woman you see here on the screen, this cute little blonde dancer actress with no experience at all, how did I go from that to running a successful, well-sought-after, well-respected, referred, highly acclaimed business accountant in one year?' I wasn't trained in this. I didn't take an accounting class.\
\
[00:18:00.860] - Katherine\
I don't have a business degree. And more than that, internally, since that's my new focus, I enjoyed working with money almost, actually as much, if not more, than I enjoyed being a full-time actress. This job was fun. How is that possible when money used to be the greatest source of fear and stress in my life? Like something weird happened. And then I realized I am so good at this because I'm a storyteller first. I never stopped being a storyteller. These pictures are from my very first brand photoshoot. Do I look like an accountant to you? Yeah, no, I still don't. I still don't look like an accountant. I still don't talk like an accountant much either. I knew I had to get these shots because I wanted to visually represent the transformation my clients were going to have with me. I wanted to tell the story. I am so good at my job because I'm still a storyteller. Money is primarily a language with which we tell stories. And because I was a dancer, because I liked all the weird plays, I had over a decade of experience in telling stories with an abstract and symbolic language like money.\
\
[00:19:11.800] - Katherine\
I could intuitively take the goals of my clients, and I could arrange all their financial data to give them more information about that goal. I could tell a story with money. And when I realized that, I realized I could teach that to other people. So, this became the money storyteller method. Its three pillars are the money story, the money systems, and the money map. This is how we can transform ourselves from avoiders into successful business owners who use money as our teammate. This is how we can get to the root of all that inconsistent growth, our poor time management, all that financial insecurity, and we can flip it. It can help us. This method will help us keep more money and take more time away from work. Just like that successful business owner I talked about at the beginning of this presentation. Let's get into this. Is this your problem? Are you an avoider now? What does avoiding your money look like? Here are signs that you are an avoider. You hope or trust that things are going to magically work out. They have before, so do you really have a problem?\
\
[00:20:17.120] - Katherine\
I mean, do you really have to put any effort in here? Okay, you might think that you could just make more money, not realizing that you're automatically going to start spending more money, too. That's good. I have no problem with people who spend money. But if you don't have clear boundaries in place to make sure that money is going to your most important things, then you're not going to get wealthier. And so is money actually taking care of you even if you know how to make more of it? Maybe you already have a bookkeeper and accountant, so shouldn't they just tell you everything you need to know? You don't feel ready, so you never set up the systems. You never invest in that tech. Or you're like, 'I'll do that when I get bigger.' And so you end up wasting a lot of time and energy cleaning up messes. Or maybe you have tried a system. Maybe you've read Profit First, a great book. But he suggests you have seven bank accounts. And so maybe you did that. You read this book, you did all those steps, you tried the new system, and it was really complicated and you got frustrated, and so you just stopped working on it.\
\
[00:21:17.300] - Katherine\
Or maybe you make every decision based on your bank balance. You just open it up and you hope that your credit card is going to clear, or you hope that you're going to be able to spend this money and it's going to be safe because maybe you don't need it next month. The money is right there now. Hope it's okay to spend. Or maybe you're just you're settling for good enough. Your bills are paid, and you generally enjoy your life. So, why bother? If it's not broken, right? Why fix it? And you don't realize that you're likely leaving money on the table, especially when it comes to taxes and your investment strategy, that financial planning because you're settling and you're not investing in what you need that's going to allow you to grow. And there's other people too like, 'Oh, what you don't know doesn't hurt you.' You don't know that this is costing you real money. You don't even realize that you're avoiding it. You don't ever make it a priority to learn how money works and to improve your ROI of all of the actions and money that you're spending in your business. Let's get really specific.\
\
[00:22:15.050] - Katherine\
If you resonated with one or two of those things, and sometimes me too even, I definitely had a lot of those back in the day. Let's get specific. How much is this avoidance costing you? Let's measure it, right? Here are some examples to get you started. What is on your to-do list that you just need to just get done, right? Just get done. Are you looking at your bank or credit card accounts regularly? Are you tracking and planning with your money? Do you need to get organized? Do you need to file? Are there piles everywhere? Do you need to finish your tax prep? Have you filed all your back taxes? Do you owe anybody money? Are you creating a tax savings account? Are you raising your rates? Do you need to finish and finally get that online course out there? Is there something you've been sitting on that you just need to get visible and promote more? Are you enhancing the value of your offer? Do you know a way that you could improve it and charge more? Do you just need to do it? Are you pitching yourself? Are you actually cold emailing people and be like, 'Oh, my God, I'd love you to engage? Oh, my God, I'd love you to pay me. Oh, my God, I'd love you to become a client.' \
\
[00:23:12.260] - Katherine\
Are you putting yourself out there? Are you following up with leads? Are people reaching out to you and then you let them sit for a couple of days before you reply and they get cold? Are you collecting on any invoices that are past due? Are you addressing fees or looking at your expenses, and all your tax subscriptions? Are you focused? Are you doing time blockings that your most important things are getting done? All of these things could be ways that we are avoiding our money. Make your own list. You can come up... These are some general things here, right? Come up with your own specific ones, pause the video if you need to, and then come back. What's next? All right, now let's figure out the cost. Remember, in the client examples I gave, my clients who were not valuing themselves or need to be less conflict avoidance, there was both a dollar cost and a pain and emotional cost. How much are you losing by just not getting this done and letting it worry and distract you?\
\
[00:24:07.390] - Katherine\
I have a ton of examples on the screen, but here are some of my favorites to get you started, right? Raise your rates. These are all real client examples that I gave you. Raise your rates. Well, you'll stop resenting your clients and you'll earn an extra thousand dollars a month. That's nice. Finish getting your offer out there, and start to promote it. You'll stop feeling out of control like you're just so busy. And that extra offer or that new thing might make you $50,000.00 this year if you get it launched. Are you pitching yourself? Well, you'll stop comparing and feeling jealous of other people's successes. You'll start focusing on what you can do, and maybe you'll bring in like $6,000.00 of sponsored revenue or co-speaking fees. Are you following up with your leads? You stop wondering if you're not good enough and you're going to close more sales and you're going to get an extra $10,000.00 this year as a result. All real things I've seen people do. Or maybe you need to collect on some past-due invoices. You'll stop feeling small and ignored and you'll find $3,000.00 just sitting there. You just need people to pay and focus on time-blocking, this is my favorite one.\
\
[00:25:07.520] - Katherine\
By not doing this, well, you could end your overwhelm and maybe you'll earn like an extra thousand dollars a month because you are prioritizing better. All real examples. Again, tons of things on the screen. Pause the recording if you need to, figure out your own examples, and estimate what is this costing me emotionally and in dollars. Now, add all these together. Using all of the examples from the previous slide, I showed you the math here on the screen. Per month, it added to $26,820.00 just in the monthly things they were avoiding. Then per year, if I added the months together and then I added all those annual increases that they would have, it was $419,640.00. But don't just stop at one year. Over 10 years - if you don't do this now and you just let it sit over 10 years - that's $4.19 million that this person could be making. So, what's your number? Again, pause if you need to, add everything together. It's not unusual to do this with clients and to come up with one million or two million dollars over 10 years that they're just letting sit there because they're avoiding their money. If your number is only a few hundred thousand, you're likely underestimating your costs here.\
\
[00:26:20.890] - Katherine\
But even still, that's a few hundreds of thousands of dollars that you're just not getting. So, if all of this is possible for us, and we know this is possible for us, why are you avoiding your money? Here are the reasons I hear most often, right? 'I don't like money.' We secretly wish we could just get away from having it. Money is icky. It's bad. It's uncouth or it's just downright evil, right? 'I'm not in it for the money. Or I'm bad with money. It's just too much to learn. I feel overwhelmed. I can't face it, okay? Or I'm frustrated. Why can't this just get handled? Why can't anyone just do their job here? I have team members. I have a bookkeeper. That's their problem.' Or, 'I am bad at saying organized. I'm just bad at it.' Or, 'It's too much work and I'm already exhausted by the effort I have spent here. And I am so busy. I don't even know what I'm looking at.' That's another really common one. 'This is confusing. I'm not good with numbers. I would just be wasting my time,' right? Or my favorites, 'Well, everything works out anyway, so I'm good, right? It's all working out eventually.' \
\
[00:27:32.140] - Katherine\
All of these, all of these examples, are the excuses that I hear when people are avoiding their money, and I point this out to them. All of these are tied to a strong emotion, just like my client who didn't value herself or just like my client who didn't like conflict. And when we realized what was driving that avoidance, the things they did were amazing. My one client who didn't like conflict, he didn't only raise his sponsored post rate, he raised all of his rates. He started making 50% more in every area with no additional work and people paid it. And my client, who was making 30 thousand dollars a month but barely paying herself, she did even bigger things. She did this whole list. And then she got really honest about all of the things in her business that she didn't like, but she was tolerating. So, she restructured her team so she could manage a lot less. And she started shipping inventory to her home office because it was cheaper, and she had to spend less time alone in a warehouse that she didn't feel safe in. So, she did everything from home.\
\
[00:28:37.940] - Katherine\
She got to spend more time with her daughter as a result, and she was able to raise her salary by a thousand dollars a month in only three months because all of these changes made her so much more profitable. We all have strong emotions, and when these strong emotions will come up, we get thrown into a stress response. That's just naturally how humans work. That's how our bodies work. And so if we're thrown into a stress response, we're either in fight or flight mode. And so, we avoid our money. That is the response of when we're stressed, right? And it becomes this vicious cycle. Money makes us uncomfortable, and then we've got this huge mess come tax time and it's really hard to clean up, which makes us more uncomfortable. So, even though we're like, 'Oh, my God, this is the last time,' we just keep avoiding it and on and on and on and on. So, why does money, in particular, bring up these strong emotions? Remember I said the information we get about money from our parents and our friends and our partners, it's not very good information? Yeah, this can be more dangerous than you first realize, because all of this information will make up our personal money story.\
\
[00:29:46.650] - Katherine\
It affects how we think about, how we feel about, and therefore, how we use our money. And most of this is unconscious. It starts happening even when we're kids. When we see our parents fighting about money, even if they're trying to keep it from us behind a closed door, but we know that's what they're doing, we learn that money is a source of conflict. Or when our friend won't share her cool new toy with you, and then later your father is like, 'No, you cannot have that. What am I, made of money?' You learn that money is something other people have and there's not enough for you. When you're promised a gift or a raise at work, but only if you're a good girl or only if your performance improves, then you learn that you deserve money only if you're good, hardworking, or patient. Or maybe when we just ignore that our partner is eating out every day instead of packing a lunch like you do because that's just easier for him, and well, his job - he's got to see clients - and you just don't say anything about it. You're learning to undervalue your needs, and that's going to be how you save money.\
\
[00:30:52.710] - Katherine\
And maybe we see a woman in a designer suit and she's at the other table, and she's just snapping at this waiter, and she's being so rude. And you learn, 'Hey, money makes you rude. And I never want to be like that person. I don't want to be like that rich person. They're out of touch,' right? I can name thousands more examples, thousands of more stories that I've heard people say about these are the experiences they've had with money, right? And when we don't slow down and we address these in the moment, your brain just believes them. And the longer you believe them, the more evidence you're going to find that money is evil, that rich people are out of touch, and that the wrong people are going to get rewarded with money. But maybe someday it will be your turn if you're just smart enough, or lucky enough, or pretty enough, or hardworking enough, et cetera. But all of this contradicts that secret I told you earlier. Money isn't evil. Money isn't anything, really. It's something humans made up, right? And as we discussed, waiting around for the right strategy or working harder isn't going to guarantee you more money.\
\
[00:31:56.310] - Katherine\
So, why do we believe these things about money? We want to remember that money is our teammate. If we can learn to speak it's language and assign it clear jobs within our business, it will come back, it will work hard for us. We can rewrite our experience with money and start making a lot more when we become aware of the money stories that are informing us in our current and in our past lives. That's the first of the three pillars, right? Get clear on your money stories. What money stories did you learn in the past? What is your current story with money? And how do you want your future money story to be different? What does making money your teammate look like for you? And then we need a system so that our money stays organized. By looking at our numbers regularly, we can talk to money, and we'll gain even more clarity about our current money story because we're not just aware of the emotional cost, but the dollar cost or the emotional result and the dollar result of all of the things that we're generating through our blog and our business. And then we can pull it all together into a money map.\
\
[00:32:58.330] - Katherine\
A money map is a collection of financial reports like a spending and a revenue plan, a cash flow forecast, and your monthly PNLs. If you learn to read all of these things, it's how you can assign money jobs and measure its progress and keep both you and your money prioritized and focused on your ideal future. When you have those three pillars, instead of avoiding your money, you're going to have these good money habits instead. You're going to have improved emotional intelligence. You're not going to panic when something unexpected happens. Instead, you're going to have the tools to process strong emotions and show up for the hard work anyway. You're not just going to be just a hopeful dreamer. You're going to have a clear vision to work towards and a clear path to get there, and the information you need to evaluate if that plan is working. This isn't guesswork. You can know, money will tell you. You will pay your taxes easily, and you're not going to stress about it. It's done. You handled it all year long. You're going to ensure ROI a return on your investment when you spend money on your blog.\
\
[00:34:03.660] - Katherine\
You will have a clear strategy for growth, and you will feel confident that you're going to be able to achieve it. You will be a good steward with the money that you're making. You're not going to earn more and then accidentally just spend it all, too. You will make sure your money goes to the most important jobs, and you're not just going to be guessing all the time about stuff. You're going to review your money regularly, and you're actually going to enjoy it because money is fun when it can be your teammate. You will have more money in the bank, and you're going to have more money in your retirement account. And you're going to spend less time working because you're going to have complete clarity on what needs to be prioritized to achieve your goals. And you're going to have a clear plan for how to get more work off your plate, get it to your team as you continue to grow. All of this is possible. So, start by getting clear on your money stories and improving your communication with money. In the Summit Bundle, I have included Tackling Money Issues as a Team, a mini course for couples who want to communicate about money with less conflict.\
\
[00:35:11.390] - Katherine\
Often, this is something that we have to talk about with our partners if we're married. But even if you're an individual, you can use this course to learn to communicate better, to learn how to get clear on your past money stories, and some of my best mindset tricks to transform money into your teammate. You can upgrade in the Summit and you can get started on that mini-course right now. It's included along with all of the other goodies that people gave you. Or if you're like, 'Katherine, I don't want a mini course. I am ready to take myself seriously as a blogger and as a business owner. I am ready to scale past 5K months to 10K, 20K, and even 30K and beyond. I want all these financial pillars in my business. I am ready.' Doors are now open for my Unstoppable program. It's a hybrid one-on-one and group coaching program, and in just four months, we will finish and you will have all three pillars of the money storyteller method, and the tools to make creative freedom and financial stability in your own business.

**Transcript:**\
Kesha JonTae [00:00:12]:\
Hello. Hello. Hello, everyone. Thank you for tuning in to my presentation today. My name is Kesha JonTae. I'm an income tax strategist and today, I want to talk to you about one of my most favorite subjects ever, taxes. Now I know some of you are probably thinking taxes? What kind of weirdo likes talking about taxes? It's me. I'm that weirdo.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:00:34]:\
So allow me to introduce myself because I'm sure most of you have absolutely no idea who I am. Again, my name is Kesha JonTae. I'm an income tax strategist and I work with small business owners including content creators, influencers and bloggers just like you to keep more of your hard earned money in your own pockets and out of Uncle Sam's hands. I have worked in the tax departments of multi million dollar corporations helping some of the richest people in the country save thousands of dollars on their tax liability and I created the Millennial Taxpert to help small business owners, again, just like you do the same. Now I have a few degrees and some fancy licenses and taxation and I've been working in the industry for over 15 years at this point. So instead of calling myself a weirdo, I like to say that I'm more of a tax nerd, if you will. And my mission is to make sure that every taxpayer is equipped with the knowledge and the resources to legally reduce their tax liability. So today, we're going to be talking about how you can keep more of your own money in your own pockets with some advanced tax deductions that you can use as a high earning blogger content creator influencer.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:01:39]:\
My goal is to show you how to use these advanced strategies to maximize your tax savings, which can free up some cash flow so that you can reinvest in your business, your future, take yourself on a vacation, whatever it is that you want to do with your money instead of give it to the IRS. Now during this presentation, I'm going to be sharing a lot of information with you. So to make sure that you don't miss out on anything, go ahead and close out of any of your extra tabs, turn off your notifications, grab a pen and some paper and take some good notes. In today's presentation, I'm going to be sharing with you 3 advanced tax deductions that you may or may not have heard of, but that you can definitely take advantage of as a high earning content creator, blog, or influencer. I'm going to be showing you how to maximize those savings and I'm gonna be giving you some actionable steps that you can take to take advantage of these deductions right now during this tax season. Now before we get into all of that, let's talk briefly about why this even matters. It matters because the more and more money you make in your business, the higher and higher your tax rate gets. And the higher and higher your tax rate gets, the more and more money that you pay in income tax.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:02:43]:\
Now also, the higher and higher your tax bracket, the more valuable deductions are to you. So for example, if you're in the 22% tax bracket and you have a $100 deduction, that's gonna save you $22 in taxes. If you're in the 37% tax bracket and you have a $100 deduction, that's gonna save you $37 in tax. So the more and more money you make is even more crucial that you're taking advantage of all the deductions that you qualify for because that's where you're gonna see big tax savings. Now that's not to say that if you're in a lower tax bracket, you shouldn't be looking for all of your deductions. You absolutely should always be trying to max out your deductions. But the more money you make and the higher your tax bracket, it becomes even more crucial to make sure that you're taking advantage of every deduction that you can so you're not paying any more in tax than you absolutely have to. Now anytime I start talking about maximizing deductions or taking advantage of advanced tax strategies, I start getting a little bit of pushback.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:03:48]:\
So let's address those right now. Some of the most common ones that I hear are one, hey. I've already maxed out all of my deductions and that may be true to where you have maxed out the deductions that you know about, but the tax code is vast. It's thousands and thousands of pages long and there's so much stuff in there that may apply to you that you don't even know about. So it's always good to work with somebody to see if there's something else that you can be taking advantage of to free up some cash flow to reinvest in your business or again, in your own self because we love a good self care moment. Okay? The second thing that I hear about is implementing these advanced tax strategies seems to be entirely too complicated and not worth it. And I don't want anybody to get caught up in the term advanced tax strategies because while they while it's true that some things are very intensive to get set up, some of these advanced strategies, once you learn about them, they're very simple to implement and you realize that they don't take any additional time and actually, it might just be something that you're able to take advantage of or something that you're already doing. So it's no extra burden on you or no extra lift in order to be able to get this deduction and maximize your and minimize your tax liability, I should say.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:05:09]:\
And the last thing that I hear a lot is, hey. I already work with a tax professional. I've been working with this person for a million years at this point and if I was eligible for it, they would know about it and they would tell me. And what I say to that is that not all tax professionals are created equal and that's no shade. It's just that some people specialize in certain things and some people may not understand certain advantages or certain opportunities that there are out there that might apply to your situation. Also, what I have found is that for the most part, people only work with their tax professional one time a year and it's during January through April when they're trying to get their return done and their tax professionals are super busy and they don't have a lot of time to sit down and really dig into your tax situation and figure out what the actual opportunities there are for you. And so they really just kind of get surface level with the opportunities that they can find for you just maxing out the deductions that you already have taken and not necessarily able to figure out what strategies you should be able to implement going forward. And so your tax professional is probably doing an amazing job with the information that they have, but they may not necessarily have that time or that capacity to go deeper to figure out what other opportunities there are out there.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:06:24]:\
So just keep all of that in mind. We're going through this presentation. So let's go ahead and talk about some of these tax deductions. The first one being hiring your family members. Now I know that you probably have heard all over social media about how you should hire your children, pay them $12,000 because then they don't have to pay income tax on that money and you get a tax deduction so then you don't have to pay income tax on that money. I'm not gonna go into detail about that because there's so much content out there. I even have podcast episodes and YouTube videos about it on my channels But what I don't really hear a lot about is the fact that you can hire your parents, you can even hire your spouse and still get tax deductions. The benefits of hiring your family members, whether that be your children, your spouse, or your parents, is that you are getting a business expense because you're hiring them as employees and you're paying them wages just like you would some random person off the street, but you're keeping the money in the family.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:07:21]:\
So you have not changed the amount of money that you have in your family, but you're reducing the amount of tax that you're paying on it. As I mentioned, there is a lot of content out there in social media about hiring your children, and for a lot of people, it makes sense. But when it comes to hiring your mom and dad or your spouse, sometimes it doesn't make quite as much sense on how you can actually benefit from that. So let's stay here for a moment and walk through what the benefit is when you hire your parents or you hire your spouse in your business. So for a lot of us, it's our turn to support our parents just like they supported us for our entire lives. We're paying their mortgages or they were paying their rents or we're paying for utilities or buying groceries or maintaining the family home, or buying new cars, or paying for maintenance on the car. Maybe we are helping out with medical expenses, or paying for travel, or giving them money to go to the casino, or whatever it is, we're paying for it in a lot of cases. And obviously, we love to do it.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:08:22]:\
We we're happy to do it because we love our parents or at the very least, we feel obligated. But, you know, it doesn't hurt to get a little something something for our efforts in April when uncle Sam comes around with his hands out. But here's the thing. If you are supporting your parents, like, genuinely supporting your parents and you qualify to claim them as a dependent, you might get a $500 credit on your tax return. And you might be able to take a deduction for their medical expenses on your tax return if you can itemize and if your those expenses are high enough to make a difference, or hear me out, you can hire them in your business. That is if they do wanna go back to work because we know how our parents can get about their retirement. Right? You can hire them in your business as a bona fide employee. You can pay them a salary that covers the support that you typically give them.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:09:13]:\
So you know how much money you're giving them per year around about how much money you're giving them per year for their household expenses or for their travel expenses or for their entertainment expenses. You know roughly about how much you're paying them for that or you're giving them for that. And as long as you can support that being a reasonable wage, you can pay them that salary as an employee in your business. Then you get to take a deduction for that on your tax return. It's the same money that you were spending out anyway, but now we've created a structure in which it becomes deductible for you on your business and you are able to reduce your tax liability. Seniors that are at least 65 years old get a little bit of a bump in their standard deduction, which means that they can make more money than somebody that's not 65 before they're required to file a tax return. So even if you're paying them more than their standard deduction, shifting that income from you at a higher tax bracket to them at a lower tax bracket, assuming they don't have any other income, will reduce the overall tax that's paid on that income. Even if they do have to pay tax on it, they're likely not paying tax at the rate that you're paying tax.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:10:27]:\
And because they are your parents, their wages are not subject to federal unemployment tax. If you were to hire somebody off the street, if you were to hire a non family member to come in and work for you, then the money that you pay them, you would have to pay payroll tax on, the federal unemployment tax, state unemployment tax, in addition to your their regular salary. But if your employer if your, employee is your parent, is not subject to the federal unemployment tax, so you're saving money there too. So now the question you might be thinking is, okay, paying your children makes sense, got it. Paying my mom and dad makes sense, got it. But Keisha, you mentioned paying my spouse, and that just doesn't make sense to me because if I pay my spouse, yes, I get a tax deduction on my business income, but I'm just creating income for my spouse and that means it's gonna raise the income back up. So how does that create any kind of a benefit? I am glad that you asked. So this is going to sound a little bit out of order, but I promise I'm a bring it back.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:11:39]:\
If you're not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, and honestly, sometimes even if you are covered by an employer sponsored health plan. The rising cost of healthcare may be something that concerns you. True, everything is going up, but healthcare always seems to just be going up by a lot. Right? And depending on your situation, you may not be able to take a deduction for all or any of your medical expenses. But there is a better way and it's called a MERF, a medical expense reimbursement plan. Now I'm not gonna get into all of the nitty gritty details because it is a lot, but essentially, what it is is an alternative to group health insurance that allows employees to get a tax free allowance for out of pocket medical expenses. Tax free allowance for out of pocket medical expenses. Stay with me here.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:12:29]:\
Right? The employee pays for the medical expenses, and then the company reimburses the employee. The downside of a MRF is that only bona fide employees can take advantage of the medical expense reimbursement plan. If you are a sole proprietorship or you're an LLC and you have not elected to be taxed as any kind of corporation, you're still considered to be a sole proprietor, then you would not qualify to be able to create one of these plans for yourself and take advantage of the medical expenses medical expense reimbursement unless, stay with me, you hire your spouse. Absolutely. You hire your spouse as an employee. Their entire salary goes towards medical expense reimbursement. You get a deduction for it on your tax return. They don't have to pay tax on it because it's considered a fringe benefit and fringe benefits are pretax.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:13:26]:\
And it's okay for you to pay your employee, as long as they agree, in 100% pretax benefits. Like, you don't have to pay them a cash salary. You just wanna make sure that you bump up the benefits enough, the salary enough to cover the FICA taxes, Social Security and Medicare because it is still subject to FICA but it's not subject to income tax. And so, therefore, now you've turned these medical expenses that you may not have been able to take a deduction for before into a deductible expense legally. So listen. We're only on the first deduction, and we've hired our kids. We've hired our spouses. We've hired our parents, and we've saved a lot of money already.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:14:08]:\
What can I say? I love this stuff. Some examples of hiring your family members are you can hire your spouse as your social media manager. You can hire your parents to do administrative duties. You can hire your children as talent. I know a lot of you guys feature your children in your YouTube videos, in your blog photos, in your Instagram photos. You can hire them as talent, pay them as talent, and get a deduction for that. But again, you're keeping the money in the family because the money is going to your own child. Now the key to making this work is to be very intentional about creating an employer and employee relationship between yourself and the family member to avoid IRS scrutiny.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:14:52]:\
That means treating them as if you would treat any other employee. Have a clear job description. Make sure what the work that they're doing aligns with that job description. Issue pay stubs and w two's. Keep track of their time. Pay them a reasonable wage. Make sure you're keeping track of all the employee paperwork. However you would treat a normal employee or a non family member employee, you need to treat your family member employee the exact same way.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:15:19]:\
Otherwise, the IRS may be able to come in and say, this is not a real employer employee relationship and the money that you're paying them is not really for work and so we're disallowing the deduction. We don't want that to happen, right? So make sure that you're treating them as if you were treating them as if you would treat any other employee. The second deduction that I want to talk to you about is the deduction for contributing to your retirement account. Now this is another one that you may have already heard about, but maybe you're really not sure exactly how it works or you don't really understand what options there are or maybe you are contributing a little bit, but you're not really maxing it out because you're not a 100% positive on how it all works and what the impact is. So let's talk about it a little bit. When you contribute to a retirement account, you're saving money for the future and you're getting a deduction for it on your current tax return. This is what we call a tax deferred benefit because you're just kicking the tax down the road. You will pay tax eventually when you take the money out of the account, but in the current year, when you put the money in, typically, we expect that we are in a higher tax bracket when we're earning the money than we would be when we're retired.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:16:26]:\
So we are banking on the fact that we're getting deduction at a higher rate now than the tax that we would pay in the future. Now the type of plan that you choose is gonna determine how much money you can contribute and the deadline for the contribution. So if you choose a a SEP IRA or a solo 401 k, you can contribute a maximum of $69,000 for 2024 or 25% of your net earnings from self employment, whichever one is lower. So you're gonna take all of your income minus all of your expenses that get you your net earnings, multiply that by 25%. That's gonna be the maximum that you can put in if it is less than $69,000 for 2024. In 2025, the limit goes up to $70,000. And I mentioned in 2024 even though right now it's 2025 because you can actually contribute to a SEP IRA in a simple excuse me, a solo 401 k up until April 15th this year of 2025 and you can make that contribution for 2024. A lot of people wait until they get their return completed to see what their net earnings are and then make a determination of how much money they wanna put into their retirement account.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:17:35]:\
They do that and then they continue to lower their tax liability. For a simple IRA, you can put in a 100% of your net earnings up to $16,000 in 2024 and I believe $17,000 for 2025 and you have until January 30, 2025 to put the money in for 2024. Follow me? Makes sense? Great. Now I strongly suggest working with an adviser to get this set up to make sure that it's set up properly and that you can make the contributions for the year in which you wanna make the contributions. But in order to implement this, essentially, you're going to choose the best plan for you, determine how much money you can contribute, contribute it, deduct it on your tax return. It's as simple as that. The last thing I want to talk to you about today are the ADA tax incentives. ADA, of course, standing for Americans with Disabilities Act and this is one that you may not have heard of before, but essentially, you may qualify for a credit or deduction for costs incurred with making your website more accessible.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:18:35]:\
Now the credit is designed to encourage small business owners, such as yourselves, to make improvements to your business, to your website, to your platform so that these things can become more accessible to people with disabilities and this credit can actually cover a substantial portion of those accessibility related expenses, including website modifications for you bloggers out there, up to a specific limit. The credit is calculated as 50% of your eligible expenses up to $5,000 The credit is up to $5,000 In order to calculate the credit, you do have to spend at least $250 before anything counts. So what that means is the first $250 of accessibility related expenses do not count towards this credit, but then the next $10,000 does count towards the credit and 50% of whatever you spend over the $250 up to the next $10,000 qualifies for the credit and that's how you get a maximum credit of up to $5,000 per year. Now the question you might have is, well what is an eligible expense for me as a blogger? Well, as a blogger, eligible expenses could include adding screen reader compatibility or enhancing usability for readers with visual impairments. It could be adding captions to your videos or offering transcripts for your video content. It could include adding alt text or making sure alt text is added to images for people that are using screen readers and it could also include just generally making navigation and design changes to your website that improve accessibility for everybody. So again, this is something that you might already be spending money on. You might already be paying somebody to capture your videos or transcribe your video content so that you can post it on your website.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:20:30]:\
I know personally for me, if you go on my website, my YouTube videos, my podcasts, they're all transcribed and added to my website so if somebody wants to read it as opposed to listen to it or watch it, they have that option there. You might already be paying somebody to add alt text to your images for people that use screen readers. These are things that you might already be spending money on, but you weren't you didn't know that this credit was available. So you might be saying to yourself, Yeah, well I didn't know this credit existed, but I was already deducting these costs anyway. So what is the difference? Well, the difference is that if you have the opportunity to take a credit over a deduction, usually, you want to take the credit. Not necessarily in all cases. Very, very, very, very, very few cases have I seen where the deduction makes more sense, but usually, you want to take the tax credit because the tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in your tax. Remember I said earlier that if you are in a higher tax bracket, then a deduction is going to be worth more money to you than if you are in a lower tax bracket.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:21:38]:\
Well, the tax credit, it doesn't matter what tax bracket you're in. A dollar reduction in tax is a dollar reduction in tax. So if you have a $5,000 credit, regardless of whether you're in the 12% tax bracket or the 30% tax bracket, you still are going to save $5,000 in tax. So if you've been deducting these costs that you actually qualify to get a credit for, you want to make sure you go back and look at those expenses and try to segregate them out so you can actually get a credit instead. Now in addition to the credit, there is a separate ADA tax deduction that allows businesses to deduct costs associated with removing physical, structural, and transportation barriers for people with disabilities. Usually, this deduction applies to physical spaces, but it can also be applied to digital accessibility in certain cases. So for example, if you are making substantial modifications to a website or a platform and you're making that website or platform more accessible, this deduction actually can help you and the deduction is up to $15,000 per year based on your eligible accessibility expenses. So your eligible expenses for the deduction is going to be again when you come in and you're making major or significant redesigns to your website to meet these accessibility standards.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:23:08]:\
So for instance, if you are making major website upgrades to improve navigation, if you're adjusting colors for readability or if you're implementing keyboard only navigation options instead of having to use a mouse, for example, if you are paying for user testing or consulting for, you know, paying fees to a consulting firm or a consultant to come in and see how you can make your website more accessible to people with disabilities, those kind of costs can be included in eligible expenses for the ADA tax deduction. Again, unlike the credit, this one is going to fluctuate. The value of this one is going to fluctuate based on what your tax rate is. So if you are able to get the credit, again, I would suggest going to get the credit and then any expenses above and beyond that $10,000, you might be eligible to take this credit or excuse me, the deduction. One thing I do want to mention about the credit versus the deduction too that I didn't mention before is that in order to qualify for the credit, you have to be considered a small business. I did mention that earlier, but I didn't really define it. A small business in relation to this credit is a business with less than $1,000,000 in revenue or $1,000,000 or less in revenue or 30 or fewer full time employees. So if your blog or your content creation business is making over $1,000,000 in revenue or you have over 30 full time employees in your business, then you would need to go with the deduction versus the credit.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:24:49]:\
But if you do meet the requirements to be considered a small business and you have the option to do the credit or the deduction, I would say again, go with the credit unless your expenses are higher and then you could also possibly get the deduction for the excess expenses. So to qualify for this credit, you wanna make sure that you're keeping records of all accessibility related expenses. You should be keeping records of all of your expenses to be fair, but kinda carve out all the expenses that are specifically related to, accessibility and make sure you complete form 8826 and attach it to your tax return. That's all you have to do in order to claim this credit. So let's recap. Today, we talked about hiring your family members, putting away money for retirement and the tax incentive that you may qualify for for making your website more accessible. All of these strategies each of these strategies alone can make a big impact, but imagine what you can do when you bundle them together and include other strategies that we didn't even talk about today. So here's some things that you can do right now to maximize these deductions before you even get on a call with the tax strategist.\
\
Kesha JonTae [00:25:55]:\
First of all, always make sure that you're keeping your business and your personal finances separate. I know that wasn't really the point of this presentation, but I always mention it because it is that important. Secondly, start thinking about how you can bring your family members into your business, what roles they can serve in your business, what work you really need them to do in your business, and start creating a job description for them so that when you hire them on, you already have that taken care of. Figure out how you want to save for retirement, what the right account is for you, start looking into the different options that are available for you and see which one works best for you, and start reviewing and recording any past accessibility improvements that you made to your website in 2024 since you haven't filed a tax return yet. You still might be able to qualify, and start planning any future improvements that you might wanna take on your website and take advantage of that credit this year. Remember, that credit and that deduction is an annual thing. So if you are making these expenses every year or you're making these improvements every year, you get that credit and that deduction or that deduction every year. Now to help get you started, I have put together a free advanced blogger tax deduction guide.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.490] - Kesha\
Hello. Hello. Welcome to today's presentation. I'm going to be talking to you guys today about one of my favorite subjects, and that is taxes. And more specifically, how you can pay less money in taxes, which I don't know, I think it's probably everybody's favorite subject at this point.\
\
[00:00:30.810] - Kesha\
My name is Kesha Jantae. I am an income tax strategist, and what that means is I help small business women keep more of their hard earned money in their own pockets and out of uncle Sam's hands. And I do that through comprehensive tax plans that are full of tax strategies that are proven to help you save money on taxes. And that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today. We're going to be going over the importance of tax planning, what it is, why you need it and how it can help you save money on taxes.\
\
[00:01:00.400] - Kesha\
In case you've never heard of this concept of tax planning, I want to go over exactly what that means first. Simply put, tax planning is strategically making sure that you're paying the least amount of money in taxes possible on the income that you earn throughout the year. And I do want to emphasize that we're talking about legally reducing your tax bill, not making stuff up, but actual legal opportunities that are available to you in the tax code. And the tax code doesn't require anybody to pay more money in taxes than they actually have to.\
\
[00:01:33.660] - Kesha\
There's so many opportunities in the code for people to legally reduce their tax bill, but the problem is that the average taxpayer probably has absolutely no idea what's in the tax code, let alone what you know the opportunities are that are available to them.\
\
[00:01:52.410] - Kesha\
And when you are filing your tax return and not taking advantage of all the opportunities that are available to you, the government doesn't write you a cheque and send you a love letter at the end of the year saying, hey, you sent us a little bit too much money. Absolutely not. They're going to keep it, and they're not even going to say thank you. Now, there are opportunities in the tax code for all different kinds of taxpayers. Whether you are low income, high net worth, a business owner, a student, a parent, a homeowner, an investor, it doesn't matter.\
\
[00:02:24.430] - Kesha\
You are probably going to find something in the tax code that's going to be able to reduce your tax liability. But if I'm being honest, some of the biggest and best opportunities are really reserved for business owners and as bloggers and YouTubers and Instagrammers and influencers and content creators in general, a lot of you are actually running a business. Some of you may already know that because you've been in the game quite a while, but some of you might be fairly new enough that you don't feel right calling yourself a small business owner just yet, even though you actually are.\
\
[00:02:58.250] - Kesha\
And even if you don't think you are, I can tell you one person that definitely thinks you are, and that's everybody's favorite uncle, uncle Sam. And if we know one thing about uncle Sam, we know uncle Sam wants his cut.\
\
[00:03:12.340] - Kesha\
And when it comes to small business owners and taxes, small business owners are usually paying a huge chunk of their profits in taxes. We know that bigger companies typically pay a much smaller percentage of their profits and income tax. We hear about it every year. And actually, within the next couple of weeks, we'll probably start seeing some headlines about it as these companies start releasing their financials from their year end. And reporters start digging through the financials so that they can scoop something.\
\
[00:03:43.000] - Kesha\
We'll start seeing headlines like company A made billion dollars worth of profits and pay no income tax. Right. We hear every year. We see it every year. We talk about it every year.\
\
[00:03:56.610] - Kesha\
But that lets me know that there is a disconnect between the small business owners such as you and me and the big business owners because as a business owner, you have access to the same strategy that the big guys use. And I'm not saying that Amazon's tax strategies are going to necessarily all work for you, but some of them might. And of course, if they do work for you, they might be on a smaller scale. But at the end of the day, you still have access to those strategies.\
\
[00:04:28.830] - Kesha\
Now, there are a couple of reasons why you, as a small business owner, are paying proportionately more money in income taxes on your profits than a bigger company would be.\
\
[00:04:39.790] - Kesha\
But what it all boils down to is that one of you doesn't have a plan, and it's not the multi billion dollar company, right. And I'm more specifically talking about a tax plan. Now, some people may have never heard of the concept of a tax plan. So, yes, these are real things that actually exist. And a tax plan is a set of strategies that is going to help you strategically reduce your tax liability so that you can meet the goals in your business.\
\
[00:05:09.610] - Kesha\
And frankly, in your life now, most people that are going into business, regardless of the industry, are doing so because they have an ultimate goal of generating some kind of income. And I will say that's from personal experience, I don't know anybody personally that went into business, so they can lose money. I didn't. None of my friends did. Nobody that I know went into business specifically to lose money.\
\
[00:05:32.330] - Kesha\
So, I think it's safe to say that most, if not, all of the people that go into business, they do so because they're trying to generate some kind of cash flow. They're trying to generate an income. Now the why they're trying to generate income, this person to person. You might want to put your kids through college, you might want to buy a house, you might want to pay off your debt.\
\
[00:05:54.610] - Kesha\
You might want to travel the world. You might want to retire your husband or retire your parents or get back to your community. Whatever it is that you're trying to do, you know that's your why. But at the end of the day, the whole purpose of starting this business is so that you can generate money so that you can fulfill your why. So, doesn't it suck that when you do all of this hard work to generate this income, you got to give most of it over to the IRS at the end of the day. In business and really in life, there are two ways that you can increase your cash flow.\
\
[00:06:27.450] - Kesha\
The first one is to make more money, grow your revenue, increase your income if you will. And there's so many ways that you can do that. You can sell ad space on your blog. You can do more sponsored posts. You can charge more for the sponsored posts that you are doing.\
\
[00:06:42.410] - Kesha\
You can do both of those things, right? You could sell more products through affiliate links. You can create your own products on courses, your own membership programs. You can do so many things, even down to just being more visible so that you can increase your audience and your following so that you can command higher prices with those products that you're trying to sell on the back end. And you should definitely be doing all of those things, regardless of what I'm going to say next.\
\
[00:07:09.300] - Kesha\
You should absolutely be increasing your following, increasing your audience, doing some kind of ad or promo or sponsored post or something like that. You should absolutely be doing that. But a couple of things you have to think about when you are trying to increase your cash flow through just making more money is that one, it's not guaranteed. You're not guaranteed to get a sponsorship deal.\
\
[00:07:34.970] - Kesha\
You're not guaranteed to actually make money through affiliate links. People might see your content, or they might even click on the link that they might not necessarily buy. So that's one thing you have to think about is it's not guaranteed. So, you're going to be putting a lot of work upfront into trying to increase your income, and it's not always going to be a guaranteed payoff. And the second thing is that it might take some time for it to happen.\
\
[00:08:01.960] - Kesha\
So, yeah, while you're focusing on increasing your following on social media or increasing your list for your blog or increasing your page views, those numbers are not automatically going to turn into revenue. So, you might actually spend some time doing all of those things and then the payoff happens later. So, there's something to think about with increasing your income or increasing your cash flow by making more money. The second way to increase your cash flow is to spend less money. So, the first one was to make more money.\
\
[00:08:36.470] - Kesha\
The second one is to spend less money. You can do this by renegotiating the cost that you have to pay out to run your business. So, maybe instead of having a photographer take your photos every week, you may cut that down to every other week or once a month, and you learn how to take your own photos. Maybe you can cut back on the events that you attend. Maybe you can lay off some of your staff if you have people on your team, you know there's so many things you can do or you can look into tax planning.\
\
[00:09:12.310] - Kesha\
Tax expense is one of the biggest annual expenses that small businesses have. Remember, small businesses like mine and yours, on average, are spending a bigger percentage of our profits and income tax expense than some of our huge corporation counterparts. So, when it comes to increasing your cash flow, tax planning helps you spend less money because tax planning helps you reduce your tax burden. And that is by spending your money strategically. So, you don't necessarily have to go super lean.\
\
[00:09:45.520] - Kesha\
You just have to put your money in the right spot. So, you might not necessarily have to cut your photographer back from every week to once a quarter. Maybe you can do every other week or every month as long as you have some other things in place, like tax planning that's going to help you reduce your overall expenses so that you can increase your cash flow. Okay, so now that we've talked about what tax planning is and why it's important, tell me if this sounds familiar to you, let me know if this is you.\
\
[00:10:15.710] - Kesha\
So, right now we are in tax season. Tax season runs from the beginning of January to the middle of April, and in a normal year when we don't have all of that going on outside, tax day is around the 15th of April.\
\
[00:10:30.230] - Kesha\
Okay, so tell me if this is you. So, January comes and goes. February comes and goes. Now we're in March, and you haven't even considered pulling your paperwork together to give to your tax professionals so that they can get started on your tax return. And then April 1st gets here and you're all of a sudden starting to grab all of your paperwork and all of your documents, whatever you can to drop off to your tax professional or to upload to their portal because you got an email that told you that they need this information by a certain date.\
\
[00:11:05.730] - Kesha\
If you wanted your tax return to be filed on time. And then on April 15, they give you a call or they send you an email and they say you owe X amount of dollars. Or they might say this is whatever your refund is going to be. And now you're grumbling because even though you weren't really sure what was going on with your financial information or your financial situation because you didn't really keep up with your numbers throughout the year. I'm talking to you and you. You just knew that you weren't going to have to pay any money, or you knew that your refund was going to be higher than what it is.\
\
[00:11:41.260] - Kesha\
And not even that.\
\
[00:11:42.410] - Kesha\
You just knew it like it's not even that you just knew it. You already spent the money. So, then you ask that question that every tax professional loves to hear on April 15 or whatever the deadline day is leaning. Or you get real serious on the phone and you say, okay, so what can I do to lower that number? And that's if you owe, obviously, or if you're getting a refund, you might say, So how can we make that number higher? It's like music to my ears.\
\
[00:12:17.440] - Kesha\
I love getting that on deadline day from a customer, from a client. The truth of the matter is, if you're waiting for a tax to find tax savings, you are entirely too late. Because other than a handful of tax revisions and possibly being a little bit more organized that you can find more deductions, the things that you would have needed to do in order to save money on your 2021 tax return would have needed to be implemented in 2021. There's very little that you can do once the clock strikes twelve on New Year's Day.\
\
[00:12:53.910] - Kesha\
That's going to move the needle on your tax return. For the most part, you can only correctly record what you've done already, so we can make sure that you've captured all of your deductions.\
\
[00:13:04.190] - Kesha\
But we can't switch income from taxable to non taxable. For example, proper tax planning strategies need to be implemented early for you to get the biggest benefit from them. So, right now in January is the perfect time to start thinking about how you're going to reduce your tax liability for 2022. Right? January 2022.\
\
[00:13:27.180] - Kesha\
We're going to see what we need to do for the rest of the year. So that when January of 2023 comes, we have done what we need to do to reduce our tax liability. And not only do these strategies need to be implemented early, they need to be reviewed regularly to make sure that the strategies that you have implemented are still in line with your goals and your business. So, here's the thing. Here's the issue that causes many small businesses to overpay in tax year over year.\
\
[00:13:57.880] - Kesha\
I call it the reactive tax mindset. So, this is how the reactive tax mindset works. You make money, that's step one. You made $100, right? You had an ad, you did a sponsored post, and I know some of you all are like grumbling when I say $100 for a sponsor post, but if, for example, purposes, so, just roll with me.\
\
[00:14:18.300] - Kesha\
Okay, so you sold a sponsor post. You sold an ad, you've done product through an affiliate link or something. You've made $100. Okay. And as soon as you get that $100, you automatically set aside 30% for taxes.\
\
[00:14:32.740] - Kesha\
Some of you are, some of you are not. Some of you all are still kind of winging it. But for this purposes, we're going to say that you set aside that 30%. So, you set aside $30 for taxes. Now you might actually be paying that money in estimated taxes every quarter, or you might just be setting aside in a bank account.\
\
[00:14:51.400] - Kesha\
You might just be putting it under your mattress. At the end of the day, you set aside $30 for taxes from that $100. So now you have $70 left and you're able to use it to reinvest into the business, or you might just take it out of the business and pay yourself with it. And then when tax time comes around, you do your tax return and maybe your actual taxes that you owed on that $100 is less. And so, you're able to get some of that money back, and you're excited because you got money back.\
\
[00:15:18.780] - Kesha\
You set aside this amount of money, you didn't have to actually pay that much. So, now you can go on vacation or you can pad your savings account, or you can do whatever you want us to do with that money. Does that sound like you? It sounds like a lot of my clients, right? It sounds like a lot of people that I know. The problem is when we're in the reactive tax mindset, we may set aside some money, but we don't really spend the rest of the money in a strategic way that's going to help us reduce our tax liability even further.\
\
[00:15:46.810] - Kesha\
We kind of just want to make sure we set aside enough money so that we don't have to give the IRS even more money in April. And that's the extent of our concern with taxes until April comes around, and we see our tax bill. There is a solution to the reactive tax mindset, and it's what I call the Proactive tax strategy. And this is how the Proactive tax strategy works.\
\
[00:16:09.450] - Kesha\
Step one is still earning $100. So, you still did whatever work you did to make that $100. This time instead of paying taxes, first, you have a plan. So, you strategically put that money in its designated place. And of course, I do not mean that you're going to physically take a dollar and physically put it somewhere.\
\
[00:16:27.560] - Kesha\
But you have a plan that you're going to stick to, and that plan is going to tell you how to spend the money so that it reduces your taxable income and your tax liability. And I want to emphasize that we're doing this strategically, which means I'm not telling you to go run out and buy something that you don't need just so you can reduce your tax liability. And I know you all have seen it. I know you all have seen people get to the end of December and start asking, what are you spending your money on?\
\
[00:16:53.940] - Kesha\
Because I need to reduce my income.\
\
[00:16:55.720] - Kesha\
But I'm not paying all these taxes I'm going to buy it, too, even though they don't need it. That is not what tax planning is all about. Tax planning is about spending your money strategically. So, I'm sure that some of you are starting to do some head math and thinking this seems a little expensive. I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford to pay somebody to do this for me.\
\
[00:17:17.540] - Kesha\
And to that I say you know you're going to spend the money anyway. Remember, the tax plan is designed to help you reduce your tax liability. So, if you're sticking to the plan, then the tax savings will justify the cost of the plan itself. Now, some of you are probably thinking, hey, I have a tax lady. I have a tax guy.\
\
[00:17:36.410] - Kesha\
I have a tax person, and she or they are amazing at what they do. And if there was any opportunities out there available for them, for me, then they would have definitely caught them by now, and we would absolutely be taking advantage of them. And that might be the case in some instances, but in my experience, it's not the case across the board. And that is for a couple of different reasons. So, first of all, most taxpayers only see their tax professional once a year.\
\
[00:18:03.710] - Kesha\
And as we talked about earlier, that's usually at the last minute in a rush, trying to beat the deadline. And if you're only seeing your tax professional once a year, nine times out of ten, they probably don't have the time or the information needed for your business in order to be able to provide you with a you know personalized tax plan that's really going to provide you with strategies that you could use to reduce your tax liability. Sure, they might be able to give you some blank strategies, like put money into a retirement account.\
\
[00:18:32.690] - Kesha\
Maybe consider doing this, maybe consider doing that, but they don't have the time to go through all the projections that's really needed and the research that's really needed to see what qualify or what you qualify for in your business. And those basic tax strategies are, you know they're great.\
\
[00:18:50.200] \
I'm not knocking them at all. They definitely have value, and they would absolutely be included in a comprehensive tax plan if they make sense for the business. But in order to get the biggest bang for your buck, in order to get the best benefit out of having a tax plan, you really have to dig deep into the details of the business and just knowing that you have a business and what you sell in your business, whether it be you know I'm a mommy blogger and I do affiliate links or I'm a mommy blogger, and I do sponsor post like, that's not really enough information for a tax professional like me to be able to give you a comprehensive tax plan.\
\
[00:19:28.840] - Kesha\
I need to know way more details about your business than just what kind of business you have.\
\
[00:19:34.540] - Kesha\
So, that brings me to my second point, which is there's so much more information and more detail that goes into building a comprehensive tax plan than what your regular tax professional might have. They'll know whether you're married, they'll know what your spouse does for a living, or at least they you know who your spouse's employer is. They'll know if you have kids, they'll know how old those kids are. They'll know if you're a homeowner, if you're an investor, they'll know all of those things. But we take all of that stuff when we're doing tax planning and we dig deeper, we get deep, right.\
\
[00:20:06.320] - Kesha\
It's not just are you married and does your spouse have a job? Now we start thinking about, okay, you're married. Your spouse has a job. But how could we turn some of this income that you're earning that's taxable to you and you know hire your spouse in some capacity in your business to actually do work? Remember, we're talking about legal stuff here.\
\
[00:20:28.410] - Kesha\
So how can we hire them to actually do some work in your business and pay them in a non taxable manner so that you're still earning the same amount of money. You're still paying the same bills that you would normally pay. But now we turn some of that income from taxable to non taxable, same with your kids. What kind of interest and what kind of skills do they have that we could use in our business and make them employees and actually have them do some work and shift some income from our much higher tax bracket down to their much lower tax bracket.\
\
[00:20:59.020] - Kesha\
So, you know, when you have kids, you're paying for the basic parental stuff, but then you also pay for all that extra stuff on top of it.\
\
[00:21:05.100] - Kesha\
Right? You have to close them. You have to feed them. You have to show to them. But you're also buying them a car, possibly paying for the gas for that car, paying for the insurance for that car, buying them Iphones, Ipads and Apple watches or whatever the Android version of those things are.\
\
[00:21:21.610] - Kesha\
You are paying for PlayStation and Xboxes and you know makeup and all kinds of extra stuff for your children. So you're spending all this extra money and you're usually not able to get a tax deduction for it. But if your child has those skills or those interests that you might be able to use in your business and you bring them on as employees and you pay them as employees, and maybe now they can take the salary that they're making. And they can buy that stuff themselves, same money that you would have been spending anyway.\
\
[00:21:51.270] - Kesha\
But now they're paying for it out of their own money, and you get a deduction for on your tax return. So, in addition to getting information about your family, we'd also get more information about you know your plans for the future, your goals and again, not just in your business, but also in your life, something that you might not even think would apply to your business.\
\
[00:22:10.940] - Kesha\
To be able to reduce your tax liability might actually have some opportunities. So we could be having a conversation. And I could you know just ask, hey, what are your plans for the future? It could be anything. It doesn't have to be specifically related to business.\
\
[00:22:23.850] - Kesha\
And you can go, hey, I'm thinking about buying a house out in California that we could use as a vacation home once a year. I just really liked the area, and you know I want to have something that we can call ours out there. Now, in your head, that's not at all related to your business. So, in my head, I might say, let's see how we can take this second home that is not related to your business and see how we could generate some additional tax deductions for the business, not generate any additional taxable income, and thereby reduce your tax liability.\
\
[00:22:58.290] - Kesha\
And again, this is completely legal if you qualify for something that's called the Augusta Rule, which basically means that you can rent your home out up to 14 days throughout the tax year and not pay any income tax on the proceeds or rental income.\
\
[00:23:14.070] - Kesha\
So, you might be thinking, but, okay, how can I use that to reduce my business income? Well, your business can rent out your home, your second home for up to 14 days during the year. You can do it for business meetings, client retreats, whatever you know whatever you want to use it for specifically for your business. And on the personal side, you don't have to recognize income. But on the business side, you can take a deduction for it.\
\
[00:23:38.820] - Kesha\
So, you're literally not actually spending any money like it's not leaving your house, but you're paying less tax on that deduction. So that is not for everybody. So, don't go out and say, Well, Kesha said I could do this. You really need to talk to somebody to make sure that that works for you. But that's just an example of what could be.\
\
[00:23:55.800] - Kesha\
So, if you're still not convinced, I want to share a couple of examples that I have seen help people save a lot of money on their taxes. Now, keep in mind that these are examples. Numbers vary, situations vary, outcomes vary, but at the very least, you'll be able to see how tax strategies can actually, you know help somebody reduce their taxable income. So one of the first things that probably every tax planner goes over with potential clients, new clients, recurring clients is business entity optimization. And basically, we're going to look at what your business entity is, whether you are a sole proprietor, a partnership, and S Corporation or C Corporation or taxed as one of those because you might be an LLC.\
\
[00:24:38.680] - Kesha\
But LLC don't exist for tax purposes. LLC are taxed as one of those other four. So, we're going to look at how your business is taxed. And we're going to see if you might benefit from being a different type of business entity, your business entity really determines how much money you're going to pay in taxes on your profits. So, if you're a sole proprietor, all of your business profits are going to be added to your regular income, and you're going to pay regular income tax plus self employment tax, which is 15.3% on that income.\
\
[00:25:10.180] - Kesha\
And that's even if you don't take any money out of the business, whatever your profits are, at the end of the day, you're going to pay income tax and self employment tax. And depending on how much other income you have, your federal tax rate can be pretty high. So that's sole proprietor, the other one is partnership, and partnership is basically tax the same as sole proprietor. It's just that you have more than one owner, so the pockets are going to be split, and that's a general. There's so many different kinds of partnerships.\
\
[00:25:37.600] - Kesha\
I'm specifically talking about a general partnership, which is kind of the default type of partnership. It's taxed in the same way as a sole proprietor. But you're only taxed on your portion of the profits instead of all the profits. S corporations are taxed a little bit differently. They do flow through to your personal return.\
\
[00:25:55.590] - Kesha\
But you're only paying income tax on the actual profits of the business. And with C corporations, the company itself pays taxes at a flat tax rate, which is currently 21%. And then if you take any money out of the business, then you're going to pay whatever your regular dividend income tax rate is. So, again, whatever business entity you have is going to determine how much tax you have to pay. So, a sole proprietor that nets $100,000 in their business, is going to be paying a different amount of tax than somebody who owns an S Corporation or C Corporation that nets the same amount of money.\
\
[00:26:28.720] - Kesha\
So, you'll come to us, we'll look at your business entity. We'll run some numbers and we will determine you know whether the entity that you have now is right or whether you should switch to something else. So, let's walk through an example of how business entity optimization can actually save you money on your tax return. So, for this example, we have a blogger who's pretty popular because she is a single millennial living in a big city, and her whole platform is about millennial dating in a big city. So, she talks about her first dates, her last dates and everything in between.\
\
[00:27:00.800] - Kesha\
She started this back in 2020. She didn't have any other income in 2020, so she really wanted to get into the blogging space. So, she worked really hard. She was really focused and she grew her following and she was able to get sponsorship and sell some ads on her blog, do some affiliate marketing. And after all of that, because she was so focused, she was able to generate a net profit after all of her expenses of $80,000 in profit because that's a really easy number for me to be able to do this calculation for this example.\
\
[00:27:32.010] - Kesha\
Now what she didn't do was set up her business formally because she just got into it in 2020. So, she didn't really want to do anything permanent. She just wanted to kind of see how it went. So, she was out here operating as a sole proprietorship. Now as a single person with no kids, generating $80,000 from a sole proprietorship, she had to pay $18,000 in income tax on that income in 2020.\
\
[00:27:58.880] - Kesha\
So, after she wrote that check to the IRS, she swore that she was going to talk to a tax professional to see what she needed to do so that she can reduce her tax liability for 2021 because she did not want to pay that kind of money to the IRS again. So, then she booked a consultation with a tax strategist much like myself, and they sat down, got all her information, asked her some questions about you know where she plans to go in the business, where income expectations are for the year, and took them back to the bat cave, punched some numbers, did some research, and found out that it really would be best for her if she was to change her business from in sole proprietorship over to an S Corporation and pay herself a reasonable salary so that she could really maximize her tax savings.\
\
[00:28:41.730] - Kesha\
So that's exactly what she did. She set herself up as an S Corporation for 2021. She paid herself a salary, which was about $30,000 because that's what this tax strategist told her would help really maximize her tax savings.\
\
[00:28:53.910] - Kesha\
And she continues to work hard and focus in 2021. And she did roughly the same kind of business that she did in 2020. So, this year, instead of her profit being $80,000 from her business, she's going to pay herself a salary of $30,000, and then her profit is going to be about $48,000. The difference, you know it doesn't equal up to $80,000 anymore because she's paying herself as an employee, she does have to pay payroll taxes. That's an additional deduction.\
\
[00:29:21.520] - Kesha\
But making that change with her business from a sole proprietorship over to an S Corporation and pay herself a salary, she's able to reduce her tax liability from $18,000 all the way down to $10,000. So, she's able to save really about $6,000 when you take into account the extra payroll tax that she has to pay. But that's still a decent amount of tax savings just for changing your business from a sole proprietorship to an S Corporation. So, for the second example, we're going to stick with our millennial dating blogger friend and just take it a step further.\
\
[00:29:54.680] - Kesha\
So, back when she met with her tax strategies, they not only told her to switch her business over to an S Corporation, they also told her to consider putting money into a retirement account because not only is she saving for retirement.\
\
[00:30:08.120] - Kesha\
She's also able to get a deduction for the money that she contributes to her retirement account. So, she does exactly that. Remember, she's already set up her business as an S Corporation. So, now she's going to work with the proper people to set up a 401K for herself and make contributions. So she decides that she wants to do the maximum elective deferral, which is $19,500 in 2021, and that is going to come out of the $30,000 of wages that she paid herself.\
\
[00:30:34.780] - Kesha\
So, at the end of the day when she filed her tax return, she's going to show the $48,000 of profit from her business, but she's only going to show $10,500 worth of wages from her business in a W two, that's going to drop her tax liability down to $5,797. That's another almost $4,300 drop just from putting money into a retirement account. So, you would just for the $2,000 that she has to pay in payroll tax because she had to set herself up as an employee. She's saving about $10,000 in taxes just from switching her business from a sole proprietorship to an S Corporation and then putting money into a retirement account.\
\
[00:31:17.410] - Kesha\
And because she's the employee and the employer, she can actually put a little bit more money into her retirement account by matching as the employer, she can match her employee contribution.\
\
[00:31:27.830] - Kesha\
So, for this last example, we're going to stick with our single millennial dating blogger friend and take it even a step further back. When she met with her income tax strategy, she mentioned that one of her family members passed and left her with a house and it's in like a neighboring town. So, it's not too far. But she really likes the hustle and bustle of the big city, and the house is like a small town, so she doesn't want to move out there. But she also doesn't want to sell it.\
\
[00:31:53.100] - Kesha\
I'm not really sure if she wants to be rental thing like a long term rental. She doesn't really want to be a landlord, and she doesn't really want to deal with the headache of Airbnb right now. So, she's not really sure what she wants to do with the house. So, at this point, it's just sitting empty and she's not really sure where it's going to go next. So that's when the Strategist told her about the Augusta rule, and we talked about that a little bit earlier.\
\
[00:32:15.640] - Kesha\
So, what she could do is rent her house out to her business for business related purpose. Like, I mean, I don't know, a photoshoot, a networking event, a meet and greet, something related to do with her blog. And she could pay herself from her business to rent the house out. And the money that she paying to herself from her business is a tax deduction on her business side. But because she's not going over the 14 days, she does not have to pick up that income on her personal side.\
\
[00:32:46.560] - Kesha\
So, in this particular instance, the house is in an area that rents for, let's say $300 a night. It's like a really niche, super nice area, very touristy. People love to come and hang out and do all these things. So, she's renting it out for $300 a night. Again, obviously, these are just examples.\
\
[00:33:03.050] - Kesha\
So, things will change depending on where you are. But she can rent the house out for $300 a night to a you know third party. So, she decides to have a photo shoot there once a month. So that's twelve and then maybe one time in the spring and then one time again in the fall. She has some kind of networking event.\
\
[00:33:26.380] - Kesha\
So that's 14 days that she is using the house for her business and she's renting it out to her business for $300 per night during that time frame. So that's a $4,200 of income that she's moving from her business over to her personal side, and she doesn't have to pay tax on it. But she's getting that $4,200 deduction on her business. Having that extra deduction is going to reduce her tax liability by another almost $1,000. So, it brings her tax liability down to about $4,800.\
\
[00:33:59.560] - Kesha\
So, remember, she started at $18,000 in taxes that she had to pay for 2020 because she had $80,000 worth of income on a sole proprietorship. So she switched that business over to an S Corporation. She paid herself a salary. She put money into her retirement account and she rented out this extra house that she just happens to have to herself and is able to meet the Augusta rule. And that dropped her tax liability from $18,000 in 2020 down to about $4,900 in 2021.\
\
[00:34:29.780] - Kesha\
And she made the same money. She still made $80,000 in profit. But she moved that $80,000 in a way so that it maximized her tax saving. So, she didn't need to run out at the end of the year and buy a whole bunch of stuff that she didn't actually need. All she had to do was stick to her plan.\
\
[00:34:46.880] - Kesha\
And the best thing about it is that as long as the tax laws don't change too drastically, she's going to be able to see these tax savings year over year over year. Now, I made up our single millennial dating blogger friend, so any resemblance to a real person is seriously just a coincidence. But that doesn't mean that these strategies are not out there for you. Your situation is going to be different. Your circumstances are different.\
\
[00:35:11.920] - Kesha\
So, the strategies that you employ might be different. But the point is that there are strategies out there for you to be able to maximize your tax savings and stop paying the IRS more money than you have to. Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that when people go into business, ultimately, it's because they're trying to make some kind of money. But the reason that they're wanting to make money varies from person to person. So, personally, for me, I'm trying to be somebody's rich Auntie that's always on a plane somewhere, traveling to exotic land, buying a whole bunch of gifts and bringing them back to my nephews and you know supporting my community and giving back to charity and doing all those things.\
\
[00:35:49.950] - Kesha\
But ultimately, I want to be somebody's rich Auntie, that's number one. Okay, but yours may be different from that. It probably is different from that. So, what I want you to do, if you feel so inclined to share is go to the comments and type in your ultimate Why?\
\
[00:36:04.520] - Kesha\
When it boils down to it, what is it that you want to be able to do? Why are you doing this logging thing as a business in the first place? And then once you have that written down or thought of in your head, if you don't want to share, I want you to think about our single millennial dating blogging friend who, by making a couple of tweaks in her business, was able to save $10,000 a year in her business. And I want you to think about what an additional $10,000 a year can do for you.\
\
[00:36:39.510] - Kesha\
Notice I didn't say for your business, but what can it do for you?\
\
[00:36:43.920] - Kesha\
How can it move you closer to your ultimate Why? That is what I am here for. I'm here to help you meet your goals to help you meet your ultimate Why?\
\
[00:36:54.640] - Kesha\

[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton\
Hey, guys. It's Liz Stapleton. I can't believe that this is the last session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, February 2020. It has been incredible to see everything the speakers have presented, to see you guys and your feedback. I'm sure you guys took a ton of note because it was a lot of sessions, and you're probably feeling a little bit overwhelmed right now, maybe, with all the things on your blogging to-do list. In this session, I'm We're really going to talk about how you can take action on everything you learned because you learned a lot, a lot of that. This is just some of the stuff you guys posted in comments and emails and in the Facebook group. And it was just you love the session, you took so many notes, and just now I'm sure you have a lot to do. There was actually a lot more than this. I just tried to get some of it in here. So how do you actually implement it all? So first of all, I want you to realize that any progress is progress. And I'll show you what I mean, because you do not have to get everything done that you learned in the next week.\
\
[00:01:13.820] - Liz Stapleton\
I know you want to, but sleep's important, family's important. If you have a dog like me, she's going to whine at you if you're working all the time. But any progress is progress. And I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you some embarrassing pictures of my website. So I want to show you what my website first looked like. So if you're new, really, I guarantee you're probably miles ahead of where I was. This was the very first version of my website in August 2014. It was called Friday Night's Shenanigans. You can't even... It's terrible colors. It's awful, right? A year later, it's actually not that much better. I had between then, between 2014 and this is August 2015, I had actually taken and signed up for my very first blogging course. I think I signed up in May. And so that's why I have an email list stuff going. But that's about all I had going for it. I managed to finally figure out how to make a drop-down menu. Took me six months to figure out how to make a drop-down menu, but good times. And then this was in summer or fall of 2016.\
\
[00:02:14.360] - Liz Stapleton\
Again, still not that much better. I have a better background, still can't totally read the writing. I would like to go ahead and take credit that I took that picture that's the background because I was trying to make stock photos or something and doing a terrible job. It's like a white sheet, Anyway, this is like two years in the blogging, guys, and my site looks like this. So I promise you, any progress is progress. And then I changed names and There we ran in. This was the first version of the rebrand in 2017. And then finally in 2018, started to see my site take shape into what it is now. It's a little bit closer. And then I really haven't touched it in a year, but this is it looks like today. So this is when I started. This is when I started, this is today. So any progress is progress. And don't be afraid to put things out there. They're not going to be perfect. You're probably going to cringe when you go back and look at them. I definitely cringe when I see this on so many levels. I don't know why. I had DIY.\
\
[00:03:19.700] - Liz Stapleton\
I'm not a craft blogger. I didn't know what I was doing. So just any progress is progress. And then I want you to recognize the layout of the So I was very intentional on how I crafted the schedule of the summit. So the first day was foundational stuff. We had tech sessions, we had design and branding sessions. Day two, we got into more of the... So day one was foundational, and day two was a bit more of the structure. We had content creation sessions. We had legal sessions to make sure you're protecting your business. We had a bunch of other... So I was very... First day is foundational, second day was structural. Third day, we were talking about marketing and how to get your stuff out there with social media and Pinterest and YouTube. I believe that was the right day. And just really getting stuff out there. And then day four was about monetization, where you learn how to navigate your analytics and how to do sales pages and create courses and do sponsored content. So it was really focused on monetization. And then today has really been focused on automating, systemizing, scaling, and time management, because it can be a lot.\
\
[00:04:38.240] - Liz Stapleton\
So recognize the layout of the summit and how it was presented. And then think, is your foundation strong? You probably learned a lot in those sessions the first day. Go ahead and try to implement some of those things. Make sure you've learned the tech. And then just anything that you're like, yeah, I need to do. That's probably stuff that you only have to once. So maybe you just need to go fill in that foundation a little bit. Maybe make that your first thing you do. And then just get it done, get it off the list. And then I want you to look at the structure of your blogging business. So Tuesday, it wasn't just content, it wasn't just legal stuff. We also had some accountants talking the money side of blogging and having to be a CEO and look at things like that. Look at the structure of your blogging business. Is that sound? Do you need to register with your state? Do you want to form a business entity? Do you have a separate banking account for your blogging stuff? Do you have a privacy policy on your site? These are all things that you want to just...\
\
[00:05:41.080] - Liz Stapleton\
Again, they're typically things that it's setting it up right, that you may have skipped over. If you've been blogging for a little while, I definitely skipped over some of these at the beginning. So you want to just go in, set your strong foundation from those sessions, go and look at the structure, and do what you need to do to make sure you're protecting yourself and you're setting up your business for success and for growth. And then day three, once you've got the foundation stuff and the structure stuff set, then you want to come up with your marketing strategy. Don't try to do it all at once. Really focus on Pinterest if you're going to focus on Pinterest, or really focus on YouTube if you're really going to focus on YouTube. Do one at a time. Don't try to do all the things. Maybe YouTube is not your thing, or Pinterest isn't your thing, or Instagram isn't your or it's just not where your audience is. Maybe your audience isn't on Pinterest, maybe they're on Instagram. It just depends. You need to know your audience. And that was a theme running through, I think, many of the sessions throughout the summit is knowing your audience.\
\
[00:06:44.690] - Liz Stapleton\
And knowing your audience is going to help you figure out what marketing strategy is going to best for you. Because you not only want to go where your audience is going to be, but you also want to go where you enjoy. If you hate Instagram, can you find your audience somewhere else? Or maybe You don't want to do Instagram. I mean, everyone's a little bit different. Everyone has different strengths. So day three was marketing stuff. Come up with a marketing strategy. Look at the notes from day three and make a list of ideas. We're not going to... You don't have to implement them all. We're going to get to that list of ideas in a bit. But look at your day one notes, make a list of what needs to be done. And I would probably prioritize those. We'll get to that in a minute. Day two, what's I'm on the list? Just make a giant list. I know it's going to be a lot. I have been blogging for obviously years and I learned a lot from the summit. I have a long list that I'm going to share with you guys, just as an example.\
\
[00:07:41.050] - Liz Stapleton\
So we're going to talk about how to deal with that. But look at the marketing strategy you want to focus on and really write it down and get clear, because I know when you end up with so many ideas from summits or from conferences, it can be hard to implement if you're not really clear on them and you like And ideas can go floating, right? And you need to capture ideas, right? Jeff Goin talked about that, is you need to capture your ideas. If you've ever read Big Magic, it's a similar thing. But yeah, so capture the idea is in a big list. We're going to deal with that list in a minute, but make sure you do that. Focus on one monetization strategy at time. So maybe you want to go through your entire site and optimize it for affiliate marketing. Fine. Do that, but make Take out your focus and realize it's going to take more than a day. It takes time. Give yourself time. Give yourself a month, two months, three months, depending on how much content is on there. And say, Okay, well, each day I'm going to do two posts.\
\
[00:08:43.260] - Liz Stapleton\
I'm going to go through and make sure they're optimized. I use Lasso, which makes it easy for me to tell how well monetized a page or post is. But there's other things you could do. You could go post by post. It's up to you. And then systemize one thing at a time as well. Because, and I'm guilty of this too, when you try to systemize all the things, it can get complicated really fast. But if you just do one thing at a time, it's easier to replicate that system for other stuff. And I find the simpler things are, the better they work, personally. So I just want to keep that in mind. And then when you can, upgrade to tools that allow you to automate. When you can afford it. And there are some free tools. So I automate with free tools. I use a lot of Google stuff that I can just automate. Zapier is a great automation tool that has a wonderful free plan. I was on it for years. I literally just had to upgrade to it this year. And I've been blogging since 2014. So, wow, almost six years. Anyway, so like Zapier is a free tool.\
\
[00:09:52.130] - Liz Stapleton\
So there's free tools out there that can grow with you. Clickup, you've heard talked about a lot in the summit. It's free, Airtable is free. You So there's lots of free tools you can use that can grow with you. But you do, like Jen Williams said, you want to pick something that can grow with you because it's a pain to move stuff over. I've been through that more than once through email marketing services and course platforms. And just, yeah, it's annoying. I think I finally found my Goldilocks moment with tools in 2020. So what I want you to do is I want you to say, I'm just three things to get done this next week. And I want you to comment Comment below with what you're going to do in the next week. I want you to commit to that. Just three things. And maybe there are three things from the foundational stuff. Maybe it's three things from the structural. Maybe it's three things from three different days. It's really up to you and I think you need to pay attention to what is going to make the biggest difference in your blogging business. Also what excites you most.\
\
[00:10:51.390] - Liz Stapleton\
Because if there's three things you dread, you're not going to get them done. At least one or two of them has to be exciting where you can't wait to see what the change what it's going to do for your business. One should probably be an easy check off. But yeah, so I want you to review your notes, like I said, and then make a list of everything. And then I want you to implement the strategy that Jennifer Dawn covered. If you missed her session, basically what she said, and it was light bulbs for me. I was like, I can't believe I've never done this, is when you look at that list, you need to designate the priority of those. So are they A tasks? Are they B-level tasks? Are they C-level tasks? I think she said D and E, but I'm going to focus on A, B, and C. And then make sure that each day you're getting at least one A-level task done. So prioritize them like that. And if you feel like you're not making progress, you need to look, Okay, well, have I just been working on C-level tasks? Because that makes a big difference.\
\
[00:11:48.390] - Liz Stapleton\
So think about that. And I'm just going to give you an example because I'm sure you have long lists. This is part of my list, and some of this existed before the summit. But I was like, I really need to fix my Google Analytics. My Google Analytics has, I am embarrassed to say this, but it's been messed up for a year, and I don't know why. I've tried to go in and figure it out a couple of times. I need to just sit down and do it and get it fixed. I need to set up. I use Lasso. I pay for Lasso. I use it on one site, I can use it on my other. I just haven't done it. I really want to read the brand storytelling book that Lanie Lamere mentioned because it's not the first time that book has been mentioned to me. I feel like the more I hear it, the more I'm like, Yeah, I need to go read I want to implement her Airtable base because it's very different than how I've thought about a content strategy before. I need to complete my move to Elementor. If you guys saw that session or some of the other sessions, I have been moving away from a different page builder that I have been using.\
\
[00:12:45.390] - Liz Stapleton\
And I had been struggling with Elementor until I took Pete's lesson, and then it just really helped me a lot. Like his one session, and I was off to the races with Elementor. So I need to finish moving everything over. I need my home page on my Less Debt, More Wine site, which is my personal wine site, which I showed the example of. If you're on mobile, there's no way to easily access the blog, which is bad. And I need to fix that. So I want to look at my brainstormed list of ideas, and then I want to marry them with my Google Search Console data, because I have Google Search Console. I've had it set up for a long time, but I've never really dug in. And there were some great sessions in the summit when I When I was recording with speakers, I was like, I need to do this. I'd love to start doing video. I'm not going to go through my entire list, okay? But the point is everyone's got a list, okay? But I'm going to ABC these, making it so people can actually get to my blog. That's probably an A-level task.\
\
[00:13:48.530] - Liz Stapleton\
It won't take long, but it's something that needs to be done. Completely moving everything to Elementor, that's going to take me time. That's something I'm going to be in the next quarter. By the end of the next quarter, I want to be moved over to Elementor. Part of the reason is because I don't want to renew the other page builder I've been using. So you can look at things like that to create the dates. And then don't go to alone. Blogging, you're in front of your computer the whole time. And it can be lonely. And so I really found the most progress with my blog and got the furthest when I had others to talk to and made friends that were other bloggers. So go join the Facebook group if you're not in there already. The Facebook group is staying open after the summit is over. So that is a great group of people that you can relate to and talk to and help you stay accountable and on track. And if you're looking for something more than just a Facebook group, let me know because I am playing with some ideas on that front.\
\
[00:14:49.280] - Liz Stapleton\
But I'd love to hear what you'd be interested in. What would help you to stay on track with all the ideas from the summit? What accountability do you feel you need? Let me know. Tell me in the comments, tell me in the Facebook group, because I would love to try to provide that for you because I know this is a lot and it can be a lot. But don't go alone with blogging. Make a friend It can be you find a couple of people, maybe from the Facebook group, and you create a mastermind where you meet once a month. Masterminds have pushed me to new heights. They truly have. I've been a few. I've left some. It happens. But they can be a great way to just hold you accountable, because if you have other people that know you're working on something, and by the next call, you haven't done anything on it, they're going to call you out. And it's helpful, but it's in a supportive way, because I don't know about you guys, but I've been blogging for six years. My family still doesn't understand what I do. My parents and my sister, they're asking me about the summit or something, and I was like, well, it's not really...\
\
[00:15:56.410] - Liz Stapleton\
And they're like, yeah, we still know what you do. And I've been self-employed for over three years. So if it weren't for my blogging friends, then I know I never would have gotten self-employed. I'd never be doing this summit for you guys, especially because many of my blogging friends are speakers. And then I'm so excited to meet the speakers I didn't know and get to get to talking with them. It's a lot of fun. Just reach out. You'd be surprised at how generous the blogging community can be and how many people are willing to be like, Yeah, I need a buddy, too. So don't go it alone. Don't be afraid to switch things up. If one group isn't working for you, no drama. Just feel like, guys, I'm going to move on and go find another group to create or something. That's fine, too. So don't go to alone. And give yourself grace. Because I know blogging can just take over your life. But of course, life is about more than just blogging about it. Give yourself grace to do one thing at a time. If all you do each day is get one thing off that list or even one subtask off that list, because some of those, at least from my list, it actually has several steps to it for me to actually get that done.\
\
[00:17:15.140] - Liz Stapleton\
I just get one step done. Because you're looking at this list and it's on top of what you're already doing with your blog, creating content regularly, whatever it is you're already doing, chances are this list is piling on. And hopefully some of the systems and automations, and Kayla had a great session on how to onboard a VA, hopefully all that will help you to take some off the plate or lower the amount of time it takes to do things. Some of the perks should help you Look at that. And yes, there's paid products and the perks, but there's also my magic pin generator that I created. It's totally free for my subscribers. I should say it's totally free for my subscribers. But you just subscribe and then you're able to put in 10 titles into a form. In a few minutes, it's going to send you an email with 50 pins. So five pens for each post or each title that you do. And you can swap stuff out. The graphics that are in there, you can use because I took them, so I own them. I'm like, Yeah, go ahead and use these on the pins if they work for you.\
\
[00:18:16.770] - Liz Stapleton\
So give yourself grace. Do one thing at a time. And that's one of the hardest lessons I had to learn in my almost six years of blogging, is giving myself a break because it is 100 % possible to constantly be working on your blog. I've done it. And life's not that fun, we need to. It's unhealthy for me in a lot of ways, at least. So give yourself grace, give Give yourself a break. Don't beat yourself up. I know none of us want a post to go out late, but if it's just a one-off, your audience will understand. No one's perfect. So I just like to say that. Give yourself grace. And then finally, I just want you... In case anyone hasn't told you today, you are capable. Because if I can do it, really anyone can. Do you recall what my site first looked like? And I'm still here. So if you're willing to dig in your heels and keep going at it, I found in my experience and just talking to other bloggers and stuff, typically, if you can make it a year blogging, you're going to make it. So you are capable. If I can do as anyone can, I mean, My parents are vastly different technologically, and I probably take after more leaning towards my mom who can walk towards a computer and it'll crash.\
\
[00:19:39.180] - Liz Stapleton\
I am not kidding. And so it's a long running joke. She was like, here, Let me show you. And she's managed to do it on multiple occasions. I don't know why computers don't like her. So I can figure it out. You totally can. I've never been a super techy person, but I am stubborn and I do like to learn and I don't stop learning. So I think if you follow those as well, you're going to make... You're going to hit your goals. And hopefully you've taken a lot away from this summit. And if not, if there was a session you were absolutely dying to see, and you miss it, you can always grab the All Access Pass. That is available to you. And it will give you lifetime access to the session. So you can go back and watch ones you missed or rewatch ones, because I definitely... In preparing for the summit, I watched many of the sessions more than once to get everything ready, which we still had a couple of tech issues, and I do apologize for that. I tried to get those fixed as quickly as possible, but I was pretty proud that we had as few tech issues as we did because I had spent so much time going through them.\
\
[00:20:46.840] - Liz Stapleton\
And I feel like every time I went through them, I took away something new. So consider that if you need the extra time, consider getting the all access pass, but no pressure. Hopefully you got a ton out of this. Go join the Facebook group. It is free to join. There's a great group in there. Everyone's super nice. I like hanging out with you guys in there and I'm not going away. So the Facebook group isn't going to suddenly shut down or go dark when the summit ends. If you want to keep things rolling, go join the group. Let me know if there's something that I can do to help you, please tell me that, too. You would shoot me an email, hello@elizabethstapleton.Com. Hello@elizabethstapleton.come I can talk, I swear I can say my name. Or tag me on social media or DM or something. I'm not as good at checking the DMs, actually. So email is probably best for tagging me if I'm being completely honest. But yeah, so you are capable. Give yourself grace. Don't go it alone. And look at that list. Go through all your notes, make a list. A, B, C.\
\
[00:21:56.540] - Liz Stapleton\
That. Prioritize those tasks. And then set realistic like, my goal this quarter is to get this one task done. Maybe that's it. Or my goal this month, don't be like, I'm going to try to get all this done in the next two weeks because you will burn yourself out. And blogging is a lot of fun, but burning out is not. So don't do that. And guys, I cannot thank you enough for coming to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. It has been a labor of love for me as I've worked on it, especially the first time. And I put in hundreds of hours of work. And so I'm so glad you guys showed up and found value in it. And hopefully the next one will be even better. So thank you again for being part of the summit. I hope you found this helpful. If there's anything I can do that could be helpful or make this better, please, please tell me. I'll catch you guys at the next summit.\

Alright, I think I'm live.\
\
[00:02:48.670] - Liz\
Hey, guys! Everyone logging on?\
\
[00:03:02.190] - Liz\
I am working to see YouTube live has changed a little bit, which is how I'm running this. So this is going to be a little bit interesting. We'll see how it goes and I apologize ahead of time if something goes wrong. All right, if you guys can hear me, I'd love it if you could pop in the chat, which is to the right of the video and just say "Hi", let me know where you're from.\
\
[00:03:30.120] - Liz\
I'm going to give it a couple of minutes, since it's not actually 9 o'clock yet, but it looks like some of you are here already. So.\
\
[00:03:46.510] - Liz\
Are we excited for the Summit? I'm excited for the Summit.\
\
[00:04:22.170] - Liz\
All right, guys, it is officially 09:00 a.m.. It is time to kick off the Summit. I'm super excited. I hope you guys are as well.\
\
[00:04:33.330] - Liz\
Yeah, so if you guys want to just take a second, say hello. To the right of the video, you should see like a chat box. It's got like a little like chat icon. So if you can comment there and chat and say Hi and let me know where you're tuning in from.\
\
[00:04:49.500] - Liz\
Hi, Becca.\
\
[00:04:51.990] - Liz\
Let me know where you're tuning in from and what you're most excited about. So this is live. Most of the sessions are pre-recorded.\
\
[00:04:59.340] - Liz\
South Florida. So nice. No. It's actually been really cold there lately, hasn't it?\
\
[00:05:06.730] - Liz\
So, this is live. Most of the sessions, like I said, are pre recorded, but the speakers will be inside the chat to the right.\
\
[00:05:14.680] - Liz\
Oh, my goodness! Yay! I love seeing you guys. Caitlin, Susan. Kimberly. Melissa. Patrice. Dana, Angel, Linda, Katie. Bianca, Kelly, Shria.\
\
[00:05:28.130] - Liz\
Hi. From California. I'm originally from California. Catherine. Wow.\
\
[00:05:33.090] - Liz\
Thank you guys so much for joining me. Massachusetts. I lived in Massachusetts for ten years. I love Massachusetts. I've kind of been a little jealous of the Blizzard pictures I've been seeing.\
\
[00:05:44.030] - Liz\
Okay. Alabama. Yes. Okay. Yay! I'm so excited!\
\
[00:05:49.490] - Liz\
Turns out I've got a small hiccup. So video livestreaming with YouTube. It used to be that I could share my screen and I'm not seeing that option. So this is going to be a little bit different than I had planned, but we're going to carry on and we're going to work through and it's going to be super exciting. So part of this session right now is going to be...\
\
[00:06:12.870] - Liz\
Outer Banks! See, I moved. I lived in North Carolina for four years. I've moved all around, guys. I've lived in all the corners of the US.\
\
[00:06:23.790] - Liz\
So this session could be a little bit like how to get the most out of the Summit and sort of what you should be doing, what you shouldn't be doing. We're also going to do a little bit of where do you find all the things? Because I love to offer lots of stuff with the Summit, but not all tools can accommodate, so I use multiple tools and I know it can be a little bit confusing from your end.\
\
[00:06:49.450] - Liz\
First of all, I do want to encourage you, if you have any questions, to leave them in the chat to the right of the video and I will keep my eye on them so I can make sure I answer them.\
\
[00:07:00.370] - Liz\
But first, hopefully you've noticed that all the sessions are categorized, right? So we've got beginner, Intermediate, advanced. And the way I kind of think of those levels, are beginner is you either haven't started your blog or you've just started your blog or even blogging like under a year and you haven't seen a lot of results. Intermedia is you've started seeing some results, you started making a little money, you're trying to grow that. And advanced is you're looking, like you've got a solid foundation, you're looking to scale. Okay, so those are sort of the beginner, intermediate, advanced sessions. I really encourage you not to try to watch...\
\
[00:07:39.650] - Liz\
Oh yes, angel, try refreshing your feed.\
\
[00:07:50.790] - Liz\
So, I really encourage you to kind of pick a level, beginner, intermediate Advanced and stick with it because there's so many sessions! Like do not try to cram it all in. It is a lot. It's taken me months to work through all these sessions.\
\
[00:08:06.510] - Liz\
So, if you're a beginner, stick with beginner. If there's maybe one or two topics that you want to dive a little deeper on and you want to watch the intermediate and advanced versions, then go ahead and do that. But really limit it to no more than a couple specific.\
\
[00:08:25.230] - Liz\
Yeah, Cindy, really my point is don't try to watch every single session like it will be too much and you will feel overwhelmed and your to do list will be insanely long. I mean, even if you just follow, even if you just kind of follow like one level, you're still going to have quite the list of ideas, I think. Which is why you should absolutely attend the implementation session on Friday, which I will also be teaching live.\
\
[00:08:56.940] - Liz\
And by then I will hopefully figure out how to share my screen. Although I don't know that I need you for that anyway!\
\
[00:09:03.150] - Liz\
Because in the implementation session on Friday afternoon, you're going to basically come up with an action plan for all your ideas that you got from the Summit. Okay. So that's really my biggest piece of advice is don't try to watch all of them. Pick a level. Maybe in some areas you're at a different level. Then watch the session that applies to you there.\
\
[00:09:22.970] - Liz\
And you can always go and look at what sessions are, what categories. So there's the levels and then there's categories that's all listed under categories in Hey Summit.\
\
[00:09:33.790] - Liz\
So if you go to schedule at the top of the page...There you go. Jolanda, sorry. And if I'm mispronouncing your guys' names, I'm sorry. I'm doing my best.\
\
[00:09:46.370] - Liz\
So if you go to the schedule, there is a view by category so you can view by level and you can also view by topic. And it'll show you what sessions are and you can always add them to your calendar depending on what you got going on. But also I believe in the notebooks inside your Swag Bag, and we'll get to your Swag Bag in a second, I believe the schedule is in there, or at least I only have the notes for that level.\
\
[00:10:10.730] - Liz\
Thank you.\
\
[00:10:13.370] - Liz\
So the page you are on right now watching this session. Okay. To the right, you have the chat. You guys are using it. It's awesome. I love it. And the chat to the right is where speakers will be live in the chat when their session is airing.\
\
[00:10:31.990] - Liz\
But below, if you scroll down, there is a comment section. There we go. Some people have been using that. And so if you want to kind of leave a comment, especially if you love the session, you just want to give the speaker some love. You can do that in the comments section, but the chat is where it's really going to be focused live. Also on this page, when you scroll down, you're going to see the description, you're going to see info about the speaker, visit the website and on the right, which I don't have one for this session because you're here at the Summit, that would be what I want you to do.\
\
[00:11:06.980] - Liz\
You can see the speakers like call to actions and a button to go check it out. The speakers aren't going to get your emails unless you go to their site and you sign up for everything. Yeah, they aren't going to get your emails. I don't share the list with all the speakers. So if you go to the site and sign up for something, you'll start getting emails from that speaker, but otherwise you're not going to get 50 speakers sending you emails. So that is really the Summit page.\
\
[00:11:34.380] - Liz\
Now when you aren't able to attend live or if you want to re watch something during the 24 hours it's available up at the top of the menus, you should see replays. So, the replays will be the replays will be up in the menu. You can click on it and it will show you the replays. It'll show you all of them. But you're only going to be able to actually watch the ones from the last 24 hours. If you click on one that's already expired, it's going to be like your access has expired. Okay.\
\
[00:12:06.560] - Liz\
Only the sessions we sign up for, right? I'm not quite sure I understand that question. Like you only get calendar reminders for the sessions you sign up for, but you can attend all of them. I'm not quite sure I understand your question, Denise.\
\
[00:12:29.150] - Liz\
Oh! No, even if you signed up for the speaker session, unless you actually go to their website and sign up for something, they're not going to email you.\
\
[00:12:49.830] - Liz\
I like to follow the rules. So you should see up at the top replays schedule speakers. If you just want to learn more about the speakers perks, I'm going to cover that in a second. And then there's always upgrade. If you decide you want longer access, you can upgrade to either the All Access pass or the Pro Pass and the information on that page. And that's all I'm going to say about that.\
\
[00:13:10.590] - Liz\
So the perks, this is where there are some...Let me answer a question real quick. Are the extra resources only available in the live sessions? I didn't see them in the Propass. Extra resources, like the freebies and stuff, or like the call to actions from the speakers.\
\
[00:13:30.170] - Liz\
They should be inside the Propass, especially in the notebooks. I'm trying to think if I actually added them where the sessions are. I feel like I did, but I would have to double check that I was sick when I was trying to put all that together, and I'm a little bit like, did I do that? I'm going to make a note to check that so that later today, in the Facebook group, I can comment on that.\
\
[00:14:04.850] - Liz\
Yeah, Catherine, you can attend any of them, like the ones you signed up for, like add to your counter, that you should hopefully just get your calender ding or whatever as a reminder. That doesn't mean you can't attend the others or that you have to attend them.\
\
[00:14:21.830] - Liz\
Sorry, can I repeat that?\
\
[00:14:25.950] - Liz\
Extra resources, so Felicia, I'm assuming you're talking about like the speakers, like calls to action and stuff that they might have? Like if they have a freebie or something? Those should be available in the Pro Pass, in the notebooks, in the Action Taker Workbook in the Speaker Offers section. I don't remember if I added them specifically where the videos are in the Pro Pass. I'm going to double check. So I was sick when I was trying to get all that in and together and so I don't quite remember. So I will double-check and I will make a note to talk about that inside the Facebook group. And we'll talk about the Facebook group here in a minute. But hopefully that helps so.\
\
[00:15:06.450] - Liz\
The last thing I want to show you in Hey Summit. So, Hey Summit, this is where you're at right now is where all these sessions are going to air. If you have the Pro Pass or All Access Pass, that access is inside Thrive Cart, you are still not going to be able to view these past 24 hours in Hey Summit, because that's just how it's set up so.\
\
[00:15:26.100] - Liz\
The perks, though, are where you can find some discounts that some companies have kindly extended to you guys as attendees. They're super awesome. And I will be sharing more about those in an email and putting a spotlight on them because I feel like the last couple of years people didn't know they were there.\
\
[00:15:45.510] - Liz\
The legal template perks that are in there, so those are from me.\
\
[00:15:50.170] - Liz\
I'm actually doing a special sale today. I'm going to say if you're interested in legal templates, don't buy them through the perks yet. Look out for the email today and check out the Facebook group because there's going to be a better deal today. After today, those are going to be the best deals so. That's the perks.\
\
[00:16:10.390] - Liz\
Now let's talk about another perk you should already have access to is your Swag Bag. So your Swag Bag is inside of Thrive Cart. And if you don't have access to it, shoot us an email. So if you log in to it should be doublejacksmedia.thrivecart.com/l/ and you should be able to sign in or hit forgot password.\
\
[00:16:33.710] - Liz\
And inside there you should find activity books. So for your kids, there's even one for like your partner. There's a blog post template. So if you are already blogging and you're like, I need to get a post up. This week there's a roundup blog post template that you can use and it's a generator, so you just fill it in. It will give you a rough draft. There's also BINGO.\
\
[00:16:56.080] - Liz\
So inside the Facebook group, if you guys aren't in the group yet.\
\
[00:17:00.390] - Liz\
Oh, yeah, I can totally put the link. That sounds like a good plan.\
\
[00:17:08.290] - Liz\
Here we go. Not just 24 hours. The Swag Bag is not 24 hours. No, you've got access to the Swag Bag for forever. And Pro Pass gives you unlimited access. But that unlimited access to view like the sessions is inside Thrivecart. So it's not inside Hey Summit.\
\
[00:17:25.230] - Liz\
So when you log into that doublejacksmedia.thrivecart.com/l/, you should see your Pro Pass access and all the videos and everything are in there. And I'm going to work on trying to I got to figure out if I'm going to be able to add the chat.\
\
[00:17:41.330] - Liz\
So that I can post. Yeah. Yolanda, is that closer to your name? Am I pronouncing it better? Yay, I can figure it out.\
\
[00:17:57.990] - Liz\
And if you haven't started your blog inside the Swag Bag, you'll also find like start a blog, walk you through some stuff so. The BINGO card though is in there. And so each day in the Facebook group, if you haven't joined the Summit Facebook group or if you've requested to join, you haven't been let in. I have a tool that is automatically approving people based on criteria, and I've said that if you did not answer all the questions for joining the Facebook group, you will not be approved. And so I'm trying to go through and those that didn't do it, declined so that they can re-request to join and fill out the questions again.\
\
[00:18:37.050] - Liz\
So the BINGO card. So I've already posted in the Facebook group the prizes today. So each day there's going to be different prizes.\
\
[00:18:44.430] - Liz\
The rules for BINGO is inside your Swag Bag as well. And you can only win once. But so you have a BINGO, you'll comment on the BINGO post with it. I will close out that comment thread at probably 05:00 or 06:00 pm pacific time today and then draw winners for the prizes. So each day it's different prizes. I can tell you that there's going to be a couple of chances to win, like the All Access pass or the Pro Pass or the Website Legal Templates Bundle.\
\
[00:19:15.660] - Liz\
Today, the prices are 1000 Short Pixl credits per month. The second prize is Website Legal Templates Bundle and the third prize is the All Access Pass. So it's super fun.\
\
[00:19:27.970] - Liz\
I will be going live at the end of each day inside the Facebook group to just say Hi and hang out and talk about some tips that might help based on what you guys learned today.\
\
[00:19:40.680] - Liz\
So like today, I believe on my notes I'm going to talk about I'm obviously going to talk about BINGO and make sure you know what's going on. I'm going to be talking about that special sale I have and then just in general, answer any questions you guys have.\
\
[00:19:55.470] - Liz\
It is the same Facebook group as last year. Yeah. I like to say I'm too efficient to create new Facebook groups each year, but it'st... Efficient is definitely my code word for lazy.\
\
[00:20:10.810] - Liz\
Okay. And then I haven't been given access yet either. Okay. Janet.So, literally the tool is working on it right now. I see it going through stuff because it pops up and tells me.\
\
[00:20:24.190] - Liz\
You'll also find inside your Swag Bag the session notebooks. So they're broken out. I think I've got beginner, intermediate and advanced. So you kind of pick one or multiple. They are PDFs and they are fillable on your computer. So if you don't want to print them out or you want to be able to type or something, you should be able to do that.\
\
[00:20:43.960] - Liz\
There's also a separate notebook for the Implementation Workshop that will be taking place on Friday. And then, of course, the step-by-step text setup tutorial to start your blog is in your Swag Bag as well. Okay.\
\
[00:21:00.050] - Liz\
Could you put the link for the Swag Bag? Yes, actually, I'm going to go ahead and put it in the comments because there's not as much going on in there. So that way you can see it inside the comments. Okay. Which is further down on the page.\
\
[00:21:19.170] - Liz\
Angel, I'm really sorry. You can't get it working.\
\
[00:21:24.310] - Liz\
Okay. What's the difference in the Session Notebook and the Action Workbook? So if you got access to the Action Taker Workbook that is like cheat sheets for each session and it gives you action items based on what the session is about and everything. So I've gone through and I've created cheat sheets and been like, okay. And it's like prompts of like, hey, this is what the talk is talking about. What are you going to do? What are your notes on this prompt?\
\
[00:21:53.770] - Liz\
Whereas the session notebooks, they include information about the speaker and their offers and tools they use and stuff, but it doesn't give you the cheat sheets or the spark notes or whatever. So the action taker workbook is really designed to help you take action quickly. Hopefully that answers your question.\
\
[00:22:20.590] - Liz\
All right.\
\
[00:22:28.790] - Liz\
Okay, let me check my notes on what else I wanted to make sure we talked about. So the Facebook group, like I said, it's going through right now and approving people. So hopefully you'll be approved soon. Ideally once you request, you should be approved within a few hours. If you didn't answer all the questions, that's, I've got to manually reset things.\
\
[00:22:55.290] - Liz\
And I also just make sure you're whitelisting my email address so that you don't miss the emails. It's hello@elizabethstapleton.com those are the emails that are going to come from me. You're going to get a couple of emails each day. I try not to overwhelm. You're not going to get an email an hour before every session or whatever, but you will get obviously the email that you got this morning that has the day's schedule. You'll get another email kind of midday with like hey, here's the perks that we got going on and don't forget BINGO and the Facebook lives and stuff. And then one at the end of the day that gives you links to all the replays so that if you missed one you can just go find that. So you'll probably be getting a few emails each day. Hopefully, I try to not keep it, I try not to have it be too many.\
\
[00:23:42.540] - Liz\
If you are on my newsletter like you were getting emails from me before the Summit. Then starting tomorrow you'll get extra because freebie February kicks off tomorrow. But generally speaking it shouldn't be like too too many emails each day from me. But make sure you guys are getting them so that you don't miss things.\
\
[00:24:03.690] - Liz\
Alright. I think those were like the main things I wanted to talk about during the session, is really kind of pick a lane in terms of level and categories and then making sure you knew that there's this access to Hey Summit. This is where the talks are. There's the Swag Bag. And if you bought the Pro Pass or All Access inside of Thrive Cart and then the Facebook group is where we're going to be having a lot of fun this week in live and interaction and stuff.\
\
[00:24:30.100] - Liz\
So, any questions, anything I haven't answered? Any issues I can try to address?\
\
[00:24:46.330] \
Having trouble signing into the Summit. So nothing you should see that should take you to a login page and then once you're logged in you should see just like the Swag Bag. If you aren't able to log in or if you aren't seeing the Swag Bag, shoot us an email. Hello@elizabethstapleton.com or Support@elizabethstapleton.com and we'll get you sorted out. And if you've emailed this morning, we're working on it.\
\
[00:25:17.470] - Liz\
It's me and the only other person I have helping is my VA, who is part-time and has other stuff she's got to do. So she's not even full-time, like on top of this stuff this week, she's kindly watching my inbox right now while I am live. But I promise I'm working on it.\
\
[00:25:40.190] - Liz\
Can't watch the video that air, right? Yeah. You'll have 24 hours. So if, like the video airs at 1030, you will have until 1030 the next day to watch the replay.\
\
[00:25:54.530] \
Okay. Yeah, Jennifer. So shoot us an email with the email you're trying to get into Thrive Cart with and or the email you registered with so I can see what's going on.\
\
[00:26:08.210] - Liz\
One of the issues could be and I'm working on fixing, is if you didn't register through BloggerBreakthrough.com, which then would put you through drive cart and automatically gave you the Swag Bag. If you came and looked at the speakers and stuff on Hey Summit and then clicked on book now and you registered through Hey Summit, then you didn't get added to the Swag Bag because stuff is set up through Hey Summit.\
\
[00:26:35.610] \
So I've had to manually go and pull the people that accidentally registered through Hey Summit and add them and then add them to make sure they get all the emails as well. So if that's the case, I'll go through after this, I've got kind of a list of things I got to do after this session and manually add those people. So that could be the issue, in which case I'm going to do my best. I'm going to go through and manually add those that need to be added. Okay.\
\
[00:27:08.610] - Liz\
Is there anything I'll miss if I watch the replays versus live sessions? The only thing like freebies and resources? No. The only thing you might miss is the live chat with the speaker. If you want to ask the speaker specific question, they're not going to obviously be in the chat for 24 hours, so that's really the only difference. But many of them are inside the Facebook group and feel free to ask questions in there and we will try to track down some answers. If I can't answer, I will try to track it down from the speaker. Okay.?\
\
[00:27:39.980] - Liz\
Or hopefully you'll be able to then see the chat afterwards. You're welcome, Katie. Okay. Any other questions?\
\
[00:27:52.930] - Liz\
Hopefully you guys are excited. I'm excited. The speakers are always fantastic.\
\
[00:27:59.890] - Liz\
I always get a lot when I'm going through and getting them ready for the Summit to post and everything. I get a lot. And I've gotten a lot of out of them. Hey, Alison. How are you doing today?\
\
[00:28:11.570] - Liz\
Yes, I like it. I like the excitement. My dog was so excited this morning. She threw up and I was like, I don't really need that, but thanks for your enthusiasm.\
\
[00:28:23.730] - Liz\
You're welcome! Yay! Guys, I'm excited. It's going to be awesome. Came in after eating lunch and taking the dog out. Yes.\
\
[00:28:30.900] - Liz\
I feel you. I don't know why you're holding that's weird. Maybe it's because of. Yeah, I don't know.\
\
[00:28:38.490] \
Yes, Liz, Wilcox brings the fire again. I love her, like, 90s vibe for sure. Actually, when I was looking for speakers, she like, threw her name out there and I went to her Facebook page and it was because this was like before Christmas time and it had like the N*Sync Christmas album and I was like, sold.\
\
[00:28:59.830] - Liz\
She is. So we have Liz Wilcox back this year. We have Liz Teresa. So we've got all the Liz's.\
\
[00:29:09.050] - Liz\
And we've got some people returning that spoke at the 2020 Summit and we've got new ones. So it's really exciting. There's a lot of really great speakers. Grayson's Back, Aisha Priest, who's new this year. Her session was fantastic.\
\
[00:29:24.840] - Liz\
Well, not was, is. I say was because I've seen them all already.\
\
[00:29:28.610] \
Oh, my gosh. That is commitment, Jess! It's 04:30 a.m. in Australia. I plan to watch these days, but I'm still up. Oh, my. Wow. Go, you girlfriend! Actually just could be a boy or girl. So go you. Period.\
\
[00:29:46.890] - Liz\
Wow. Yes. And kudos to everyone because the times when they're crazy in terms of all the times listed, places are Pacific Standard Time because that's where I'm located. But the replays should even if the time zones get messed up or you're confused because that totally happens to me, too. Should hopefully still let you watch what you need to.\
\
[00:30:15.390] - Liz\
All right. Any other questions? I'm still working during the quiet hours I've got. Sleeping is important. Please get some rest.\
\
[00:30:24.910] - Liz\
Okay. Still working during the quiet hours I forgot to sleep. Yeah. No, I do like to work. I do like to get up early and work, but if I'm tired, I don't because then my brain like it'll take me way longer to do something if I'm tired. And so rest is sometimes my most productive use of time.\
\
[00:30:45.790] - Liz\
All right, any final questions? Because I believe Erin Perkins session is coming up, I think it's at 9:30...It might be at 10.\
\
[00:30:57.800] - Liz\
How long are sessions? Sessions are typically about 30 minutes. So some are as short as like 10 minutes, and some I think the longest is like 37, but most are around 30 minutes. That's a great question, Dana.\
\
[00:31:09.570] - Liz\
Thank you.\
\
[00:31:12.650] - Liz\
I can't wait. And hopefully by this afternoon I'll have gotten everyone inside the Facebook group accepted. And so you'll be able to watch that live and we'll hang out then, too. Is there a way for me to make an account so I can sign in instead of getting a link?\
\
[00:31:32.070] - Liz\
Charlene, sign into what? Is that the into Hey Summit? Into Thrive Cart? \
\
[00:31:49.170] - Liz\
It is going to be epic, Denise. 100%. It always is.\
\
[00:31:55.270] - Liz\
The Summit. Okay. So Hey Summit. So, yeah, you should have an account. Are you talking about the links in the emails maybe?\
\
[00:32:04.460] - Liz\
Maybe so I can sign in instead of getting a link. Yeah, you should have an account and a password. Shoot me an email if you're having trouble, Hello@elizabethstapleton.com. Show me like a screenshot or something and we'll get you sorted out.\
\
[00:32:16.860] - Liz\
My dog is being impatient. She needs out. So during the live guys just FYI my dog's name is Lucy and my cat's name is Doug, so if I'm yelling at them that's what's happening.\
\
[00:32:27.530] - Liz\
I think the link was in the first email. Okay yeah and it is here.\
\
[00:32:35.210] - Liz\
This is the link for the Summit itself so you should be able to log in there. If you don't see like a button to log in, the three dots at the right of the navigation menu, you should be able to click that and hit login. I don't know if that helps answer your question.\
\
[00:32:56.910] - Liz\
Oh, and there's another dog named Penny, that is not in here right now, but just so you're aware there's a couple of videos I wasn't quite able to edit out like a little bit of barking, so apologies! But mostly you shouldn't hear it if you have dogs and the barking on the video which is in the background it's very subtle. It's going to set them off. You might want to use headphones. But yeah, I think I got most of it edited out. All right guys, I will see you guys later. Enjoy the rest of the sessions.\
\
[00:33:34.430] - Liz\
Like I said don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to respond to you as quickly as possible and yeah, let's go 2022!\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:07.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Hey, guys. How's it going? We officially made it through the Summit. I hope you're having a super awesome day and you're excited to do a little bit of work because this is not an observational thing.\
\
[00:00:19.650] - Liz\
The Implementation Workshop is interactive. You should have hopefully gotten the Pro Pass Implementation Workshop notebook. It should have been inside Thrive Cart. If not, I can share a link to it in the feed. Yes, I believe this is it.\
\
[00:00:43.440] - Liz\
Or in the chat for where we're at right now. So I just did that. So you can grab that. If you could let me know when you have it so that we can dive in and get going. The goal for today is that you will have an action plan.\
\
[00:01:00.180] - Liz\
You walk away with a list and a priority list of things that you need to do first and in what order. So give you guys a minute to grab that.\
\
[00:01:19.910] - Liz\
I totally just swallowed wrong. Sorry.\
\
[00:01:25.410] - Liz\
Oh, my goodness. Hi.\
\
[00:01:31.270] - Liz\
Happy Friday, everybody.\
\
[00:01:32.950] - Liz\
So go grab the notebook. We'll start in just a second. I want to give you a chance to have it printed out or whatnot, and then we're going to dive in.\
\
[00:01:45.370] - Liz\
I'm hopefully not going to choke on my coffee anymore.\
\
[00:01:50.690] - Liz\
All right, is everybody ready to dive in?\
\
[00:02:03.030] - Liz\
All right, the first thing you should see is the super cool cover, obviously didn't print it in color, is the roadmap. And so I don't know if you guys picked up on it, but the Summit had a bit like each day kind of had various themes to it. Not wholly because I was trying to accommodate speakers and then being able to be live in the chat and stuff.\
\
[00:02:31.700] \
But day one was Foundational. We talked about tech. We talked about legal stuff. We talked about business, finances and things like that. So...oh, I've got a message.\
\
[00:02:48.290] - Liz\
All right, Kevin, I'm not sure.\
\
[00:02:54.450] - Liz\
Okay. So day one was, like, really covering foundational stuff and then Planning, right. Planning out stuff, thinking of keyword research and content marketing and how you're going to accomplish your goals. And then day three is Create, creating content. Is it going to be video? Is it going to be blog post? What is it going to be? Monetization, so what are your monetization strategies? What are ones you want to build up? What are ones you want to improve?How are you going to improve them? And then Analyze, so analysis. Right? Like, what's working? What's not? Where do you need to double down and where do you need to back off. So that is kind of the approach to this implementation workshop.\
\
[00:03:43.540] - Liz\
So foundation. So on here you're going to find the sessions that apply as well as any relevant speaker bonuses. So if there's something you need to work on.\
\
[00:03:53.170] - Liz\
Right, maybe it's legal stuff. Well, the Privacy Policy Template is in there, and you can check off whether you signed up for it. If you've completed it if it's like a course or something. So I want you to go through your notes from the foundational stuff that you've done. Obviously, you guys have lifetime access, so you may have kind of pick and chose, what you went through.\
\
[00:04:14.700] - Liz\
And I want you to figure out your action items, and you can make notes here, write them here. You can also write them here in a priority of these particular ones. So not everything from the Summit, but like the foundational stuff, like the tech, the legal, the finance. What items do you have on your to do list? What do you need to get done in these areas?\
\
[00:04:35.110] - Liz\
And I would love it if you would each drop one in the chat to share because it may give someone else an idea of something they need to do because we are all human and it helps to see what other people are doing.\
\
[00:04:49.930] - Liz\
So I'm going to give you guys, like five minutes or so to probably not quite five minutes, but I'm going to give you guys a few minutes to work through that and come up with a list and share it in the chat. Pretty please.\
\
[00:06:09.610] - Liz\
You guys have some to do items in your foundation stuff, right? So I want you to look through sort of. And what do you need to get done in these areas? And I want you to write it down. I want you to share at least one in the chat. I'm gonna give you a couple more minutes.\
\
[00:07:39.630] - Liz\
All right, guys, I want to hear it. What are some to-dos you have with the tech side of things, the legal side, the finance side, what do you need to get done? And you guys are just jumping in. We're working off of the Pro Pass Implementation Workshop Notebook that you should have been able to grab. And we're kind of going through the roadmap.\
\
[00:08:05.410] - Liz\
So we're starting with foundational stuff that you need to square up, and then we're going to talk about Planning, Creating, Monetizing and Analysis. So you need to be making note of the things you got to do, and then we're going to work on prioritizing those things. And these are the relevant sessions and speaker bonuses as it relates to stuff. So you can mark off when you have stuff, when you've redeemed things. But yeah.\
\
[00:08:39.910] - Liz\
Does it make sense to sit through this again? Okay. Because you were just in the regular implementation one? Questions.\
\
[00:09:12.570] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:09:15.370] - Liz\
Yes. And if you guys just sat through the Implementation Workshop on the Non-Pro Pass holder one, you can skip this. It's fine. But I would get this notebook because there's more to it than the free one. There's stuff relevant to your Pro Pass.\
\
[00:09:32.720] - Liz\
Greyson Bell's. Yes. His session was fantastic. I always liked chatting with him. I learned a lot.\
\
[00:09:41.390] - Liz\
Okay. See you later, Kelly. All right. Anything else you guys are working on? Okay, Katie.\
\
[00:09:51.050] - Liz\
Okay. So I want you to prioritize whatever to-dos you have from this? We're going to prioritize all your to-dos at the end. So I want you to come up with foundational ones for now.\
\
[00:10:01.490] - Liz\
Right. So then there's planning, right. So you've got running a business type of stuff like do you see yourself having a team later? Do you not want a big team? How do you envision your business?\
\
[00:10:13.460] - Liz\
What sort of SEO stuff do you need to work towards? Content marketing.\
\
[00:10:21.570] - Liz\
You need to plan out how you're going to succeed. Right. So if, for example, you want to create a product, well, when that product is ready to be bought, are the people on your list going to be ready to buy? Is there a certain level of knowledge they need beforehand to be primed to buy your product? Right.\
\
[00:10:43.690] - Liz\
What kind of content can you create to prepare them for that? So that's part of planning as well as. Okay, well, if I'm going to sell a product, I need to make sure my audience is in the right place and has the knowledge necessary to take advantage of this product. If you're doing affiliate marketing, same thing. Where are they in the buyer's journey in terms of this affiliate product?\
\
[00:11:04.010] - Liz\
Or if you're looking at increasing ad revenue, you're probably focusing more on SEO and trying to rank more posts so that you have more traffic because you don't necessarily need a ton of traffic to make a full-time living blogging. Like you don't. It's just if you want to make a full time living blogging through ad revenue, yes, you're going to need a lot of traffic, but it's really everyone has different goals, so you got to plan how you're going to achieve whatever your ideal blogging business looks like. Right. So I want you to come up with some action items and then I want you to share one pretty please if you can. I know some of you are not able to do that right now and then Prioritize.\
\
[00:11:49.140] - Liz\
Okay, we're going to work through that. But yes, I'm going to give you guys a few minutes to do that.\
\
[00:13:04.430] - Liz\
So what are some of the Planning action items you guys need to do?\
\
[00:13:17.370] - Liz\
Maybe you need to set up a project management tool. If you're not using something like Click Up or Asana or Trello or whatever speaks to you, that could be something in planning to make sure that you have a centralized place to do your stuff.\
\
[00:13:59.470] - Liz\
Setting up planning in Notion. Yes, there you go. I've heard good things about Notion, but I don't really want to try something new myself. But yeah, no, I hear Notion is really awesome. That's fantastic.\
\
[00:14:12.470] - Liz\
Anyone else?\
\
[00:14:25.490] - Liz\
So, once you have your action items though, you're going to want to prioritize. Like what is something? Because some of them may be bigger projects than others. Right.\
\
[00:14:33.280] - Liz\
So I want you to make sure you're sprinkling some of the easy ones in between the big ones because those quick wins can really help you keep going when you're like. I'm so sick of why am I not done with this yet? So sprinkle and sort of the ones that won't take as long but prioritize what needs to be done sooner rather than later.\
\
[00:14:54.410] - Liz\
Okay, Content Planning. What you need to do to successfully content plan is what we're doing right now.\
\
[00:17:11.630] - Liz\
Alright guys, are we ready to move on?\
\
[00:17:31.350] - Liz\
Do I have more messages?\
\
[00:17:48.050] - Liz\
Sorry, you guys are responding to apparently having issues getting in. Did you guys have issues accessing the workshop here?\
\
[00:18:13.650] - Liz\
Okay, someone's having trouble getting in. Let me see if I can get them in and then we will keep going.\
\
[00:18:57.530] - Liz\
All right, guys, sorry. Tech is apparently not my friend today.\
\
[00:19:27.810] - Liz\
Oh, it redirected a few times. So weird. So sorry.\
\
[00:19:32.970] - Liz\
Yeah, tech is like ready for the weekend apparently because I had issues with the free Pass Implementation Workshop tech too. So just good times.\
\
[00:19:47.710] - Liz\
Okay, well, hopefully and this guy I will be downloading and uploading this into the Pro Pass section so you can always rewatch this later if something disconnects or something. And I'm very sorry.\
\
[00:20:06.430] - Liz\
So next we're going to focus on Creating, right? So creating content, is it going to be a blog post? Is it going to be a video?\
\
[00:20:11.760] - Liz\
Is it going to be repurposed on Instagram? What sort of copywriting would you potentially need? Or graphic design or email marketing? What kind of content do you create for that? And what is your goal there?\
\
[00:20:24.380] - Liz\
Do you want to create a funnel, social media video? So lots of stuff in the create section. So your list is probably going to be long. This also again reminder that these show all the speaker bonuses that are relevant to the topic so that you can keep track of what you signed up for. You will need to sign up for the speaker bonuses within the next year.\
\
[00:20:45.750] - Liz\
So once you sign up to them, you should have access to them for however long that program is available. But you have to sign up for them within the next year. So it's good to keep track of those things, right? So. I mean, if you saw the Start Your Blog Challenge last week, I have a brand new site so I have quite a few things to create and things to put on this action item list.\
\
[00:21:17.810] - Liz\
It's a long one for me. It always is. But we're going to prioritize all of them. So we're going to prioritize first the Create step because that'll make, let me actually get the right page, that'll make prioritizing everything later easier if that makes sense.\
\
[00:21:37.770] - Liz\
Trying to grab the right thing, here we go. Because you want to be creating stuff that's going to work towards your goals. Because like I said, if you're not trying to increase your ad revenue, maybe you don't need to increase your traffic so much, but you need to create a higher conversion rate on your opt-in or on your sales page or whatever. Does that makes sense? Or maybe you need to insert the affiliate link a few more times in the post because only in there once or twice.\
\
[00:22:40.310] - Liz\
So what is something that is on your to do list for Create? What do you need to be creating? Let us know in the chat.\
\
[00:23:38.090] - Liz\
You guys are quiet. Were you guys this quiet last night at the Trivia when I wasn't at your table?\
\
[00:23:53.130] - Liz\
All right, I'm going to keep moving on because I'm not hearing anything saying you need me to slow down. All right.\
\
[00:24:00.990] - Liz\
Next up on the list is Monetization. Right. So are you going to be creating products? Are you going to be going after sponsored content? Are you going to try to up your affiliate marketing game? Are you going to try to increase your ad revenue?\
\
[00:24:13.530] - Liz\
Send my monthly newsletter. Nice, Allison. Awesome. I like it. Can you make that a weekly newsletter, depending on how often you're publishing content?\
\
[00:24:25.290] \
So, real quick aside, because it's something I started doing on my other site because...Well, on one of my other sites I have multiple, as you guys know...Is you can set up. So if you're publishing a blog post weekly, then you can set up, at least in ConvertKit, I'm sure and I know with other tools as well. But obviously my experience is with ConvertKit, I can set up an RSS to automatically generate a broadcast draft. I mean, I can have it automatically send, but I prefer to review it and tweak it with the new post. So at the very least, even if I'm not sending them anything else, at least I'm staying kind of front of mind and showing up in their inbox weekly using the RSS.\
\
[00:25:09.130] - Liz\
Product and work towards affiliate marketing. Awesome.\
\
[00:25:11.500] - Liz\
Katie, I would recommend you focus on one at a time because if you try to do both at the same time, you're not going to do either one super well. So focus on one, get really good at it, and then once that's built up, focus on the other. Yes. Awesome. I like it.\
\
[00:25:29.290] - Liz\
Yeah. Pinterest marketing. Yes. Pinterest has been changing a lot the last couple of years, so I actually feel like I need to go back and do a little more Pinterest education, but it's also focused more on YouTube and SEO. But I do want to kind of translate some of that into Pinterest as well.\
\
[00:25:50.440] - Liz\
So? Yes. Pinterest Marketing Megan's session was great. Yeah, I like it. So action items.\
\
[00:25:59.550] - Liz\
And think of all the sub things too. Right? Like if you want to work towards affiliate marketing, what does that mean? Does that mean creating more posts around an affiliate product? Does it mean doing more affiliate marketing with your email list? Does that mean you need to install some tools to help you with affiliate marketing, whether that's Pretty Links or Thristy Affiliates or Lasso or whatever? What does that mean? Don't just put like affiliate marketing.\
\
[00:26:22.920] - Liz\
Put down things you can actually do that would go towards that.\
\
[00:26:29.330] - Liz\
Product. What does that mean? Does that mean surveying your audience? Are you going to pre-sell it before you create? To make sure it'll sell, are you going to what kind of product is it going to be?\
\
[00:26:38.970] - Liz\
How long is it going to take you to create it? Are you going to create it as you go? Like, people get the course. They get access to this lesson right away. And then I'm working on the next lesson.\
\
[00:26:48.050] - Liz\
There's a lot of different ways you can go about creating a product. Right. How are you going to sell it? How is it going to be delivered? Like, there's all sorts of sorts of things to consider that you want to kind of make note of if that makes sense.\
\
[00:27:03.590] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:27:06.530] - Liz\
So, create your action items, prioritize. Okay. We're getting close to the end. Well, sort of.\
\
[00:27:39.750] - Liz\
So, I'm going to give you guys a couple of minutes.\
\
[00:29:05.250] - Liz\
Are we ready to move on? Is everyone's list like staggeringly long?\
\
[00:29:15.190] - Liz\
Yes. All right, so now we're going to look at Analyze. Okay. Because it does you no good to have you doing a bunch of stuff if you don't know what's working. Right. So you need to know what metrics tie to your goals. Right. You need to know if the funnel you created is converting. If not, you need to figure out why or if you're just going to give up on that funnel and try something else. If you're not getting as many affiliate conversions, is it because the page that was giving them most conversions is traffic down?\
\
[00:29:46.680] - Liz\
What is going on? So you need to figure out what metrics you need to be tracking that apply to your goals and then track them regularly. So I actually have it set up as a recurring task in Click Up to go back at the beginning of the month to review the previous month and figure out what's working, what's not, what's up, what's down, what needs a nudge here and there. I have yet to do that for January because I've been a bit busy, but I will.\
\
[00:30:14.150] - Liz\
You know, and sort of, what systems are you going to put in place to make sure that this works, righ? If you're creating a blog post, what are all the steps for that? Can you create a system for it? And can you then evaluate that system and make tweaks if you need to?\
\
[00:30:33.390] - Liz\
So I want you to think of the things you need to do for Analyze. You need to create a recurring task. You need to install Google Analytics. You need to better understand Google Analytics. Your page views may not matter so much if you're not trying to increase your ad revenue.\
\
[00:30:49.170] - Liz\
It may be a conversion rate for a page that is a lot more than how many page views you're getting. I mean, obviously if it's good conversion rate, you want more page views if you want to increase that, but if you know the page is only converting at .1% getting more traffic isn't, like yeah, you'll technically get more people to convert, but not. It would be time better spent to work on increasing that conversion rate, if that makes sense. Okay.\
\
[00:31:31.670] - Liz\
So I want you to create your list of action items for Analysis and then we're going to work on prioritizing those and we're prioritize everything. Okay?\
\
[00:33:20.030] - Liz\
Alright, do you guys have your lists? Are we ready to work on Prioritizing?\
\
[00:33:35.370] - Liz\
Yes, all the things. I like it.\
\
[00:33:36.920] - Liz\
Okay, so next step. And obviously this isn't a long enough list for all of your tasks, but I want you to look through all of your Prioritization of the previous things we've talked about and come up with a plan to attack. Okay. And I want you to sprinkle it. So like, some stuff requires a lot more work than others. Right? But some stuff doesn't. And so I want you to sprinkle in the easy to do things in between the stuff that takes a lot of work because those quick ones will help keep you going. It'll be nice to check things off.\
\
[00:34:05.920] - Liz\
You don't want to do them all in the beginning because then you have nothing but hard things left and you're not going to want to do them. So, I want you to think about that and I want you to come up with the beginnings of your priority list. Obviously some stuff may need to change or tweak and you're not going to be able to fit everything on here. So you have to set a new one eventually. But I want you to work on prioritizing your tasks and what you want to get done first.\
\
[00:34:30.190] - Liz\
What is most important? Do you not have Google Analytics installed? So you need to get that done. Do you have an email list and you're not emailing them? Okay, maybe you can email them, yes, but maybe it's better that you create a system to make sure you're continually emailing them. Okay, does that make sense?\
\
[00:34:56.470] - Liz\
So, I'm going to give you guys. Let's see, what time is it? It says it's 4:35 right now. I'm going to be until like 4:40, about five minutes. Don't overthink this.\
\
[00:35:09.270] - Liz\
Okay, then we're going to talk about this priority list you got going.\
\
[00:38:21.710] - Liz\
One more minute, guys.\
\
[00:39:21.570] - Liz\
Alright, you guys ready?\
\
[00:39:30.130] - Liz\
Yes. Let's see. Hello. I had to restart my computer. What step are we on?\
\
[00:39:36.060] - Liz\
Oh, Mariah, we are on prioritizing all the things.\
\
[00:39:46.250] - Liz\
So. Mariah, we're going to let you catch up. Those of you that have been prioritizing, what is the first thing on your list? I want to know.\
\
[00:40:31.990] - Liz\
One more minute guys.\
\
[00:40:32.280] - Liz\
To the (inaudible). There we go.\
\
[00:41:12.570] - Liz\
Okay, yes, Mariah, if you were in the free one, then we're kind of talking a lot of the same stuff. It's just the workbook for the Pro Pass is a lot more detailed and gives you more information, including relevant speaker bonuses.\
\
[00:42:09.390] - Liz\
Alright, so once you have sort of your priority list together, I want you to refer to this as your plan. Okay? Because...With opt in plug ins system, I'd like to go with. It's the last thing on my setup list. Yes, Katie, I like it.\
\
[00:42:27.130] - Liz\
So, I want you to make this your plan. I want this to be what you referenced when you're like, what should I be doing? I don't want you to get Shiny Object Syndrome because blogging wins take time. It isn't overnight. Consistency wins the day.\
\
[00:42:41.240] - Liz\
Okay? So make a plan and stick to it for, you know, give it time to work is what I'm saying. I don't want you to be like, oh, there's a new course over there because I haven't even fully implemented everything I learned in this one. But I'm not getting overnight results. Like, I'm totally be guilty of that. No judgment.\
\
[00:42:59.110] - Liz\
Make this your plan. Put it out somewhere that you're never without an idea of what you should be doing, okay? And then you got the Pro Pass, right? So you already have things that can help you implement your plan without having to go out and shiny objects syndrom a bunch of other stuff.\
\
[00:43:16.550] - Liz\
Okay?\
\
[00:43:20.210] - Liz\
Raise your hand if you're guilty of that. So make this your plan. It's yours. So. You can tweak it. You can adjust things, but give stuff time to work. Okay? Stick with your plan for enough time for it to work. If after a few months, like, if you're working on SEO, it can take up to six months for SEO to really kick in. Okay?\
\
[00:43:41.140] - Liz\
But you have to be consistent with it and you got to keep working on it. Don't expect it to work overnight.\
\
[00:43:51.510] - Liz\
So, I just, I wanna...I will step off of my soapbox now, but have a plan. Okay? And then the end of this workbook is like a little kind of project planner page, if you will like, brain dupm all the things that have to do with the task. Because if you're setting up an opt-in plugin, right, you've got to have the email marketing system in place. You've got to, okay, what pages is it going to be on? What is it going to look like? What is it going to lead to? What happens after they submit, right? Like, there's a bunch of little details in there that you need to make sure you take care of and prioritize what's first.\
\
[00:44:34.470] - Liz\
Right? Obviously, deciding on what to go with is probably the first one, the timeline. How long do you think this project is going to take you? What roadblocks do you foresee? Potential tech issues or whatnot? And just any notes you want to make.\
\
[00:44:48.530] \
So this is like a couple of pages. And this is like a blank one. So you can actually write out what the project is or the task. And you guys can obviously print out as many of these as you want or use them on your tablet or whatever.\
\
[00:45:04.410] - Liz\
So with that. I do want to say that I did. You guys know I create a membership and it's meant to sort of be like the backup and the support system as you tackle that plan. So it's not like a new squirrel. It's hey, you're trying to figure this out.\
\
[00:45:19.440] - Liz\
Here's a tutorial if you're struggling or a template to get you started or this or that. There are stock photos in there. There's lots of trainings and short tutorials to walk you through stuff and fix things. And doors are open. Now, if you were part of the Starburst, no Blogging Besties got the one month to the membership, Starburst got the All Access Pass for next year, then I will be sending you a code that you can redeem that one month, but doors are open.\
\
[00:45:47.940] - Liz\
You can learn more about it at bloggerbreakthrough.com/go/membership you can try it risk-free. Obviously, if you get the one month free, you're really risk free.\
\
[00:45:56.420] - Liz\
But everyone else you still get, you'll have seven days. If you don't like it within seven days, let me know. I'll give you your money back after the seven days. Just cancel and you won't be charged again. Each month we do like some form of live video, whether sometimes I'm teaching live, sometimes we're just hanging out, kind of like we did yesterday, but without trivia.\
\
[00:46:13.410] - Liz\
Although, who knows? I really enjoy doing trivia. So maybe we'll do trivia. So if you guys want to join the membership. I will be responding with the coupon code for those that get the free month. But if you guys have questions or anything about the Summit or this Workshop or the Membership.\
\
[00:46:34.550] - Liz\
Yay. I'm excited. Let me know. And I'm happy to answer any questions. It's $29 a month, so I've tried to price it fairly resonably.\
\
[00:46:46.970] - Liz\
It's kind of what I wish I had when I started blogging, and even since then, it's been nice to have. Yeah. Mariah, I'm so glad you've enjoyed the Summit. I would love to see you inside the membership and see and help you grow. My whole goal with the Summit, with everything I do, is for someone to answer me like, "Oh, my gosh, you just made my life so much easier." That is what I strive to do because it's my favorite thing.\
\
[00:47:14.070] - Liz\
Yeah. If you guys have any questions.\
\
[00:47:19.270] - Liz\
So we do monthly live. There's a form you can submit your questions, and I will record answers and I will post them in there. If there's a request, you want to see if something to be added to the membership, whether it's a training, a tutorial, or a template, you tell me and I do it right. Ten stock photos a month. It's meant to really kind of be your backup and help you get past those hurdles and give you a resource and a place to go if you're stuck.\
\
[00:47:46.270] - Liz\
I've dome more this week thank I have in three months. Yay. Katie. Yes. I love it. That is amazing. You should be so proud of yourself but yeah. Any questions, anything I can help you guys out with? We still have some time, but yeah, I'm like all about answering the questions, if you got them.\
\
[00:48:23.850] - Liz\
We can go pop into the lounge and hang out. If you guys want to talk and ask questions there. Would you guys prefer to be in the lounge?\
\
[00:48:51.910] - Liz\
My dog is demanding to go out so I'm gonna call it. Okay, Katie, you have a good night.\
\
[00:48:54.050] - Liz\
Just send me an email for the Membership. Okay. Yes. Blogging Besties. I will get that started.\
\
[00:48:58.790] - Liz\
And if you guys join the first 6 hours and Blogging Besties, I will honor this. If I don't get you the thing in time, if you join the first 6 hours, you will win a fast action bonus of getting a one-on-one coaching call with me. So that is an option. And yeah, I'm excited to see you guys. Hopefully.\
\
[00:49:23.210] - Liz\
Yeah. Will get you the code. I know Travan also has emailed about it, but I've been doing back-to-back implementation workshops. So I haven't had time to really answer yet.\
\
[00:49:40.290] - Liz\
Yay! Yeah. I'm so glad to hear you guys have gotten so much. It really helps to keep the Summit is amazing at building momentum. Right, because you're so gung-ho. But in like three weeks it's going to wear off. And so that's where the Membership comes in and it will help you keep going and support you and make sure you keep getting stuff done.\
\
[00:50:09.790] - Liz\
Happens to the best of us, Mariah. Don't sweat it.\
\
[00:50:17.810] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:51:08.750] - Liz\
All right. Any, any questions, anything I can-Summit, Blogging, Workshop, membership, any and all of the above?\
\
[00:51:46.770] - Liz\
Yes, hold on. Okay. I can hang out for a minute.\
\
[00:51:57.310] - Liz\
I need a little chapstick though, my lips are drying up.\
\
[00:53:49.470] - Liz\
At last year's implementation you got me started on SiteGround. Yesterday, some of the leads shared other hosting sites since SiteGround has changed so much. I was charged for the year. Do you recommend I stick with them or can I end my SiteGround early and go with another hosting company?\
\
[00:54:01.490] - Liz\
I would see. So if you just renewed, you might be within depending on what their terms are of getting your money back. If you haven't had issues with them and you can't get your money back, then I would stay with them and just not have it renew and switch to something later.\
\
[00:54:20.770] - Liz\
You can always leave SiteGround and go somewhere else. It's just a matter of if you're going to get your money back or not.\
\
[00:54:29.510] - Liz\
So, I mean, SiteGround has had some. I know they've had some security issues. I don't know if they've gotten them all worked out. I would honestly reach out to Grayson. He would know or his WordPress Facebook group would know.\
\
[00:54:41.990] - Liz\
But yeah, I would say, see what the terms are. If you can get your money back and switch to something, then yeah, go ahead and switch. Just because SiteGround has kind of lost its standing a little bit this last year. But as long as you're not actually having problems and if you can't get your money back, then go ahead and stick with it. So, that would be kind of how I'd approached that question and that problem.\
\
[00:55:09.590] - Liz\
All right. Anybody else have questions but we can go hang out in the lounge up to you guys.\
\
[00:55:56.170] - Liz\
I didn't know Grayson had a WordPress Facebook. Yeah, it's a group. His blogging on WordPress is, I think the name of his Facebook group. It's fantastic.\
\
[00:56:04.450] \
Yeah, RocketNet and Bigscoots. Yeah, I'm on Bigscoots per Greyson's recommendation. So he's always who I trust in terms of, like, what should I do for hosting? I also pay his company monthly to maintain my WordPress site. Or at least two of them.\
\
[00:56:21.410] - Liz\
I guess now I have a third. But anyway.\
\
[00:57:03.010] - Liz\
If you guys don't have any other questions I'm going to hop off, go get some dinner. But I'm happy. Like, if you guys come up with questions later, shoot me an email at hello@elizabethstapleton.com.\
\
[00:57:12.260] - Liz\
I'm happy to answer them. Again, whether it's about blogging, the Summit, the membership, the workshop, whatever. This recording will get added into the Pro Pass and it takes a while for it to process and download and upload. Then the transcript will take a little longer than that.\
\
[00:57:27.570] - Liz\
But we will get it in there. And like I said, this air meet stuff is open through the end of the month. So if enough of you are like, hey, can we touch base real quick before that, we can do, like, a coworking session. Just let me know. You guys want to do that and I will figure out time and send it out and meet you guys in here.\
\
[00:57:47.400] - Liz\
And we can hang out in the lounge and Cowork and work through stuff. But, yeah, I really.\
\
[00:57:53.430] - Liz\
Thank you guys so much for being here, for being part of the Summit, for help making a success, for being so enthusiastic!\
\
[00:57:59.050] - Liz\
It's awesome. It's wonderful. It makes my day! And if there's anything I can do for you guys, just let me know, okay?\
\
[00:58:10.610] - Liz\
Alright.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Hey, guys. Liz Stapleton here, the host of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. And I am so thrilled that you are finally getting to see the summit in the sessions because I've been working on this for months and the speakers have just totally blown me away with their generosity and their knowledge and their actionable advice. They're over the shoulder sessions where you see their screens and how they would go about things. I have a long list of to do's after watching it. I know you will, too. But it is a lot, right? There's over 50 speakers, and I know that can be overwhelming. And so in this session, I'm going to walk you through how to get the most of this summit without totally burning yourself out. So it's probably going to be a little bit short of a session than some of the others. But I'm going to walk you through best practices and where you can find all the stuff and just orient you to the summit. So if you're coming to my party this summit, I'm going to just show you around. So first thing I want to touch on is don't try to do all the things Because like I said, there's over 50 sessions, which is a lot.\
\
[00:01:04.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So pay attention to the categories. The way this summit has been designed is so that each topic typically has three sessions, one for beginners, one for intermediate bloggers, and one for advanced bloggers. So if you're a beginner, focus on just the beginner sessions. And where you want to dive deep, go ahead and watch those intermediate and advanced ones, but pick those based on what your goals are. Don't try to watch everything. Figure Find out what level you're at and then what is most important for you to learn, your goals. And then you can dive deeper because the way it is, they are released at the same time. So the email marking sessions are typically released at the same time. And you want to watch all of them. You will have 24 hours on the free pass to do so. And you can watch one when it airs, you can watch the one, you can go to the replay of the other one. So you'll be able to stack them on the ones you do want to dig deeper. So don't stress too much if you want to watch multiple sessions that are at the same time.\
\
[00:02:02.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I structured it that way because it is more meant beginner, intermediate, advanced. But I totally understand if you want to dive a little deeper. So I do want to just show you real quick. When you go to the website, you can see the schedule, and you can really dig in there. And you should be able to pick based on the category. So you can do advanced. You can see all the beginner ones. You could say, okay, I do recommend everyone watch the legal ones. I feel like no matter what level you're at, it's probably a wise choice. And also the business ones are talking about finances with some accountants and how to manage stuff. Those, I think, are great. But you can then dig in and see what they are. And you'll also be able to see what your schedule is. So you can see what's in yours and you can even add the calendar reminders and add additional talks if you maybe didn't quite understand when you were registering what you were doing, because I know it can be a little bit confusing. So I just wanted to make sure you understood that. So don't try to do all the things that's going to help you in getting the most out of this summit.\
\
[00:03:06.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And then get involved as well. So there's a Facebook group. Go and join that group if you haven't already. And interact with the other attendees. There's many speakers in there. So if you have questions, ask. A speaker may be able to answer if it's for someone specific or even just... I mean, there's a lot of expertise in there. So don't be afraid to ask questions. Engage with the other attendees. I'm going to have some engagement threads to help people really take action and move forward and see what you guys are liking the most so that we can make this even better next time. So get involved, join the Facebook group. That's another great way to make sure you're getting the most out of the summit. And then take advantage of the perks. So I've managed to work with some not only incredible speakers, but some great companies as well to get you guys some perks to save you time, to save you money. And you can see all these. When you're here, you can see there's just a perks section. Of course, I'm going to have something random show up on my screen. So in here, you can see there's also a couple of giveaways going on.\
\
[00:04:13.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So at the end of the summit, I'm going to be giving away, thanks to Social Bee, a year of the Social Bee Accelerate plan. So it's a great value. It's a great tool. It's what I use for social media automation. And then I'm also giving away an all-access pass. And if you've already bought an all-access pass, I'll I'll refund you that and you'll still get the all access pass. So don't sweat that. There's also a magic pin generator that you can use. Create 50 pens for 10 posts in five minutes. A $30 credit for new tailwind customers. My legal templates bundle, I'm doing $47 off, so it's a great deal. Podia, which is what I used to sell my digital products, and I love them because you could do memberships, digital downloads, and courses, and product bundles. Really, it's amazing. They're offering 15 % off PodiaPlan, and that includes also 14 day free trial if you want to test that out. So it's fantastic. And then you can also see what some of the speakers are offering as well. Some of them are doing a giveaway, some of them are doing other gifts. So you can make sure to register for those if you're interested in those giveaways.\
\
[00:05:21.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So definitely make sure you check out the perks because who doesn't like perks, right? And just take advantage of them. There's So pretty much every speaker has a free offer for everyone that just helps people dive a little deeper onto the topic, and that is included in the talk as well as the summit session notebook that is a fillable PDF, so you can take your notes and be able to find them. And you'll also see the resources that they talked about. So it's a great way to just keep everything together. All right. And then just, again, take it one step at a time. So you'll see in the summit, we have a session with Jennifer Dawn, who I tagged it as a keynote. And I would recommend everyone check out the keynote. I think they're for all levels. And she's talking about mindset, but she also does a great job of breaking down how to deal with overwhelm, because I guarantee you after the summit, you're going to have a ton of action items. And so I definitely recommend watching her or her session because she will tell you how to get through that and come up with a plan of action.\
\
[00:06:25.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And another thing that could help you is finding an accountability buddy from the Facebook That's a great place to find people who know what you're working on and what you're talking about. And you can buddy up and make an accountability plan. Make sure you stick to that plan of action after everything you've learned. And then if you really, really want to get everything out of the summit, then give yourself more time, right? Because I have designed the summit to keep it moving forward during the week that it's free. But shorten the learning curve by taking advantage of the perks or some of the offers that the speakers give. Get the resources that are out there to help. And consider the All Access Pass because that will give you lifetime access to the summit sessions so that maybe you go through and you watch all the beginner sessions and then you implement all that and then you go through and watch all the intermediate sessions, right? And also the All Access Pass comes with over $2,000 a value in discounts and products from our speakers and contributors. So you can learn more about that here. It's just [inaudible]\
\
[00:07:29.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
and so it lists out. So I'm including for All Access Pass holders, my privacy policy template. I am an attorney. I always say that going to an attorney and getting one personalized is always the best option. But I know not everyone can afford that. And so using a template, especially when it's written by an attorney, is a great thing to do in the meantime. That's the next best step. But when you get to that point that you can hire an attorney, do that. But also Cindy Bidar is giving away to All Access Pass holders her email marketing momentum course And then Lanie Lamar is including her Airtable Like a Boss light course. And I will tell you, Lani's session blew me away. It had me completely re... I love Airtable and I use it already. Airtable is a free tool, by the way. It had me completely rethinking how to use it. And she includes a free Airtable sheet in her presentation. So definitely, if you're having trouble organizing your thoughts in terms of your blog content, check that out. And that's just in the session. But in the All Access Pass, she's also including this, which is great.\
\
[00:08:32.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And so that all totals to 165. But then there's all the discounts. So Jessie Festa has a one month free to her membership. There's 40 % off Conquer Your Business Analytics, 100 % off Sales Page Secrets. The list goes on and on. So this value is over... I need to update that. I think it's actually over 1,800. I need to check my math. And so total value of the discounts and products is over $2,000 So it's a great, great deal. Plus you get lifetime access to the session so you don't miss one and you can always go back to it. And it's only... If you're watching this early, then you've already bought the all-access bath. But if you're watching this, it's $97 while the Summit is live. So it's a great deal. It's the action taker price. Once the summit is over, it's going to go up to $197, which is still a great deal. But if you want to really get the most out of the session, consider the All Access Pass. But Absolutely not necessary if you just don't want to spend that money just yet. You can think about it the next few days.\
\
[00:09:36.060] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But definitely pay attention to the categories. Think about your goals. Think about where you want to dive deeper and plan ahead because these sessions will only be available for free for 24 hours after they air. So just keep that in mind so you can plan your time accordingly. So excited to have you guys here. I'm so excited to finally be able to show everyone this. If you guys have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. hello@elizabethstapleton.com, tag me in the Facebook group. Really, I'm so thrilled for you guys. Let me know a few questions. If there's something I can do to make the summit better for you, I'm all ears, and I hope you get as much out of it as I have just from talking to the speakers.\

**Title:** Your Blogger Playbook: How to Level Up Your Blog Beyond Ads\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.930] - Madison Wetherill\
Hey there, and welcome to today's presentation. I'm super excited to dive into your blogger playbook, how you can level up your blog beyond ads and after qualifying for ads. Now, I know as bloggers, qualifying for ads is the golden standard. It feels like the goal that you are trying to get to probably from the time that you start your blogging journey, or at least the time when you start to want to make a business out of this blogging thing that you are spending all of your time on. And the reality is, though, when you qualify for ads, that is really just the beginning of your journey, and the beginning of what success might look like for you as a blogger. So, if you want to know the exact playbook that you need to level up your blog beyond 50,000 sessions when you've just qualified for ads, and I hope you'll stick around. To go off of that even more, you are in the right place today if you have at least 30,000 to 40,000 sessions on your blog monthly, which might mean that you're not quite qualifying for ads yet, but you're almost there. But my point in that is making sure that you have mastered a little bit of what it takes to grow your traffic with your blog, because that's going to be needed in some of the other things that we talk about today.\
\
[00:01:28.550] - Madison\
Second, you have likely monetized your blog in some way, and you are bringing in around a thousand dollars on average per month. This ideally is going to be through ads because we're going to talk about the strategies beyond ads. And ads are also a little bit more passive than some of the other strategies that we're going to talk about today. Things like sponsored content or affiliate marketing. So, it's important to have that type of passive income on your blog. You also want to continue scaling your blog. You are not done growing yet, and you are looking to refine your systems and build a sustainable business around your blog. And then lastly, you want to know what the secrets are to scaling your blog to multi-five figures and beyond. So, if any of those apply to you, stick around. I'm so excited to dive into this content today. Now just a quick introduction to me and who I am and why I know a couple of things about what I'm talking about today. My name is Madison Wetherill. I'm the founder and CEO over at Grace + Vine Studios, where we have been building custom brands and websites for bloggers, mostly in the food space since 2015.\
\
[00:02:33.320] - Madison\
And we have branched out a little bit in the last couple of years to also serve lifestyle and travel bloggers as well. And I also have two food blogs that I run that are another side of my life and my business. And I have been through the gamut with those blogs and through the journey that we're going to talk about a little bit today. I'm also a homeschooling mom to my eight-year-old and five-year-old, and I have a one-year-old as well. And something that you should know about me is that I'm very passionate, I'm very driven, and I love to take things to the next level. I do not sit still and let things be mediocre very well. So, we're going to learn a little bit today about how we can take our businesses to the next level. So, there are four things that you should focus on after qualifying for ads, and we are going to dig into each of these today. The first is that you're going to focus on building your brand and your email list, and I'm going to tell you how those two things are combined and connected. The second is to implement a keyword research strategy and to boost your SEO.\
\
[00:03:34.380] - Madison\
The third is to diversify your revenue streams, and then the fourth is to optimize your website. Let's dive right in. Number one, the first thing that you're going to focus on when you have leveled up to having ads on your website, you've reached that 50,000-session mark or more, is you're going to focus on building your brand and building your email list. At this point, you likely have quite a large amount of people who are coming to your website every month. And it might seem like you only have 50,000 sessions, and that might seem like a small amount of people until you really start to visualize what that would look like. I want you to imagine if you were sitting in an auditorium full of 50,000 people. They were all staring at you while you created a recipe, or shared about your favorite travel location, or showed them how to knit a scarf. That is a lot of people, and it would be quite overwhelming if that was in real life. We need to start thinking about that number differently, because it seems like such a big number as you're trying to grow your blog to qualify for ads.\
\
[00:04:43.010] - Madison\
And then it seems like the second we have that number and that ad level, we are wanting to grow it even more, which there's nothing wrong with that. But I just want to put into perspective how many people are already in your sphere. And we need to start thinking about what we're going to do with those people. The reality of blogging is that most people who come to your website are going to bounce. They're not going to stick around. They might view the one recipe or make the one craft, but a lot of the time they're not going to stick around. And some of that is just the nature of blogging. But I think bloggers are often overlooking the opportunity to convert these random visitors that are coming to your website into people who are truly a part of your audience, who are on your email list, and who ultimately care about what you are doing. But the very first step to being able to do that and even having that opportunity is making sure that your website is very clear, and people know what it is that you do and what your website is all about.\
\
[00:05:41.780] - Madison\
This starts with understanding your niche. Now, you've probably heard the word niche in the blogging space. We've all heard it. Really, your niche is the type of content that you share and how you are different from your competitors who are in the same space. I like to tell my clients there are really three levels to your niche. The very first top level of your niche is going to be the main topic you talk about. It's going to be food, or DIY, or travel, or lifestyle. Whatever that main topic is, that's the top level of your niche. Beyond that and below that is going to be more specific in that topic. It might be that you share healthy recipes or travel for couples, or maybe it is knitting projects for people who love to knit. Whatever that next level is, we're going to go one level even deeper than that. And I want you to think about if I had five different people in your space, in your same niche that talk about the same thing you do, all lined up in a row, how would your brand stand out and be different from your competitors?\
\
[00:06:46.810] - Madison\
Because that is really what your niche is. Your niche is your unique view and your unique stance on what it is that you do. And then once you've dug deep and figured that out, I want you to ask yourself if this is obvious from your website. If I were to ask your neighbor or your parents or a friend of yours what it is that your blog is about, would they even know? I don't know about you, but I have been in this situation many times, and probably more times than I would like to admit when I'm at a gathering or a holiday party or something like that and someone asks me what I do. And if I say that I have a food blog, they generally are going to say, 'Oh, that's really cool. What type of recipes do you share?' Now in the past, I have been guilty of stumbling over my words and maybe spitting out something along the lines of, 'Oh, just recipes that are good.' And while that is very embarrassing to admit as somebody who is in this space, and I don't do that anymore, it is much more clear to somebody if I'm able to say, I share wholesome, easy-to-make recipes for people who want to share food with those they love.\
\
[00:07:50.720] - Madison\
That is so much more clear and it paints a picture. And it also really helps people to know whether or not my site is for them. If I say that I am a Whole30 blogger who focuses on healthy living and you're not interested in that, you're not going to come to my site. If I have a knitting blog and you've never picked up a ball of yarn, you're not going to be interested in my site. So, our niche can really help to carve out the path for us of the type of people that we want to attract to our site, and ultimately who we want to join our email list and to be a part of our audience. So, be honest with yourself and ask, is your niche defined? Is it obvious to those around you? Is it obvious to your readers? I'll be honest, most of the time in the blogging space, I find that the answer is no. So, if you want people to know what your niche is and what your blog is all about, you have to first get clear on it for yourself, and then you have to share it everywhere and more often than you think you should share, so people know what it is that you do.\
\
[00:08:50.920] - Madison\
Step two is going to be to get people on your email list. I think growing your email list is something that is so underrated in the blogging space, because we are so focused on growing our traffic that we forget we should also be growing our email list, so that we have a little bit more control over our traffic, and over how we get people to our website. Really, as you grow your email list, you are reducing the risk you have as a blogger who is dependent on social media algorithms or organic traffic, Google algorithms, all the things to drive traffic to your website. You can help stabilize your traffic to your website and your traffic sources by having control over this portion of your traffic. But even more importantly than that, having someone on your email list is the key to engaging them and converting them into a raving fan of your blog. This is how you build relationships with your audience and how you can help serve them useful content, and helpful products that they are interested in through things like affiliate links, or even selling them products down the road directly. So, if you don't have an email list or a way for people to sign up on your blog, that's your first step.\
\
[00:09:59.880] - Madison\
You want to go and create a form. Maybe you need to sign up for a free email marketing account, create the form, and add it to your website just to start collecting email addresses. Now, if you do have an email list, but you haven't emailed them in a while, I want you to think through what it would look like to get started with that again. Now, I find people often have lots of nuanced questions about, 'Well, do I need to tell people why I haven't been emailing? Do I need to reintroduce myself? Do I need to do this?' Do whatever you're comfortable with. Whatever is going to help you to get over that hump of just getting started again, do that and then figure out what your new rhythm can be for emailing your people. Maybe it's once a month that you can stick to. I recommend at least once a week. And this is something that is actually so much easier to do than people realize. It's something that you can also use a tool like ChatGPT to help you with. And really you can simplify this process and just get into the habit of doing it on a weekly basis.\
\
[00:10:53.700] - Madison\
And then once you have a really engaged email list that you are sending emails too often, try selling something to them. Whether it is just sharing a favorite affiliate product or creating a digital product that you can sell to them, this is the next phase for you if you have been emailing your list regularly. Okay, so phase number two, or thing number two to focus on beyond ads is leveling up your SEO, and I want to share a little bit of an insight into my own keyword research strategy. Now I'll be honest, today we don't have time to dig as deep into keyword research and SEO as I might like to, but there are lots of other presentations this week on this topic, and there is lots of resources out there on this topic. But just briefly, what I want to go into is thinking about how to level up your keyword research strategy. Keyword research is such an essential part of blogging, especially those who are monetized with ads and looking to grow a larger source of traffic and you want your organic traffic to be your primary source. Once you have started to see some traction with SEO and probably the majority of those 50,000 sessions that you have to qualify for ads are coming from organic traffic, it's time to level up.\
\
[00:12:07.190] - Madison\
So, what I mean by level up is first, you want to figure out where your blog sits right now when it comes to keyword research, specifically around the idea of keyword search volume. In other words, what size keywords does your site currently rank for? Are they mostly really small keywords that are maybe under 1,000 searches per month? Or are you above 5,000? Maybe most of the keywords you rank for are 10,000, 25,000. Whatever the number is, this helps you to understand the average amount or the average keyword volume that your blog can easily rank for. Once you figure that out, you can start figuring out how to go for larger keywords and leveling up your old blog post to that next level organic search traffic. But basically, the reason this is important is if your blog currently only ranks for search volume of 500, you don't want to go for something that is a 20,000-volume keyword because your blog is just not at that level yet. You can have outliers where that happens, but most often, if you stay in your lane and in your range of keyword volume, you're going to see a lot more success. This is not only going to be fulfilling for you as a blogger, but it's also going to just help propel your entire blog into a higher space.\
\
[00:13:23.320] - Madison\
The third thing to focus on is diversifying your revenue streams. There is so much focus for getting ads on your site when you are getting started in their blogging journey, that sometimes you're not thinking about all of the other ways that you could make money from blogging. Again, this is another topic that I'm sure we have lots of presentations on this week, but I want you to just think about some other revenue streams that you might want to explore. You don't have to add all of these at once. Maybe you just choose one or two that you want to explore in this next year and start to make a plan for how to do that. Adding additional revenue streams can help do a couple of things for you. It can pad your income from just having ad revenue, because sometimes at the beginning level of ad revenue, you are not going to be generating a ton of money per month. So, going deeper and having more revenue streams can be really helpful. But it also again allows your audience to go deeper with you and to have more of a know, like, and trust factor with your audience when you have things that they can purchase from you and things that they can engage with you on.\
\
[00:14:32.490] - Madison\
They're not just going to be checking out one recipe and then leaving your site forever, but you're giving them an opportunity to become a part of your audience. This can also help your expertise and authority in a broad way. I'm going to talk a little bit more about expertise and authority in our step number four. But what I want you to consider is if you are an expert enough in your topic where you are able to create something of value to sell to somebody. That immediately adds you to a different level of expertise than somebody who maybe just started a blog yesterday, and doesn't know their topic well enough to do that. Here are a couple of things that you can consider as alternate revenue streams, or additional revenue streams that you can add to your business. You can do things like work with brands directly through brand partnerships that can be through social media content, or through blog content. You can also be creating content for brands. That's another form of brand sponsorship, where you have a little bit more freedom in what you can create for the brand based on what they're looking for, and you don't have to worry so much about organic search.\
\
[00:15:37.640] - Madison\
You could do things like affiliate marketing. This in and of itself is a whole different topic that has many, many points to it, so I won't go much into it, but it's a huge way that you can bring in revenue to your website and to your blogging business. You could create digital products or physical products depending on what your niche is. You could consider one-to-one training or services. This is definitely not going to be passive in any way, but it's a really great way to inject revenue into your business, and also get to know your audience on a really intimate level when you are working with them one-to-one. You could create a digital course of your content. So, if your content is something that you could create a step-by-step course for somebody to take, that's a great way to add revenue. You could consider something like an ad-free membership. Kind of an ironic thing to consider once you have ads to also then have a way for your audience to view your site without ads, but especially as you get to a place where you have a large amount of people coming to your site, this can sometimes make sense.\
\
[00:16:37.540] - Madison\
Lastly, you could consider hosting a summit just like the Summit that we're a part of this week. Hosting a summit for your audience is a great way to grow your email list and also to be able to share your expertise and knowledge with your audience. I went through those first three examples quickly because I wanted to save the very best for last. And the thing that I know the best about all of these topics, and the thing that I'm most passionate about, is optimizing your website. I truly saved the best for last, my friends. When it comes to leveling up your blogging journey and reaching for a new level of success, focusing on your website is 100% crucial. Your website for your blog is your virtual storefront. The better it looks and it feels to your readers, the better of an experience that somebody has on your website, the more likely they are to engage the first time or to come back. On the flip side of that is the negative version, which is if your website is not engaging, is intrusive with pop-ups and distractions, people are going to leave your site and never come back. This is bad for you, but it's also bad for the long-term growth of your business because it can be a signal to Google that your site is not built for users, and it will send less traffic to you because of that.\
\
[00:17:56.140] - Madison\
So, I want you to remember that SEO and keyword research are a huge part of bringing new users to your website. But having a website that is user-friendly and engaging is really the key to building long-lasting success with Google, like I just mentioned. If you are constantly having users bounce back to Google, it is a signal to them that there's something about your site that users do not like. This has just become so important in the last few years, in the last year especially, and this is something that is going to set you apart from your competition. So, if you are using the same theme that everybody else is using, you're using the same setup that everybody else is using, you are going to quickly find that you are not scaling to the next level of success because your blog is doing nothing different than the rest of your competitors. So, we're going to talk about three main components to do to optimize your website. The very first is to make sure that your website is organized. Sticking with our storefront analogy here, no one is ever going to be able to find something to buy in your store if it's disorganized and they can't find anything, or they don't know what the process is to go and check out.\
\
[00:19:02.370] - Madison\
There are so many analogies here. I just want you to think about the worst shopping experience you've ever had, and we do not want to do that on our website. Likewise, people are not going to engage with your website to come back to it or to recommend it if it's disorganized and unclear. We want to make sure again that your niche is clear on your website. That's something that is more of a content side of the organization in your website. We want to also make sure that people know what your website is about, and that they can easily find the content that you talk about. The categories that you have on your blog are very important to organize for your readers, but also for Google, because Google understands your website as a web, so they understand the little side arms of the web as your categories. They also understand it through your navigation menu. So, you want your navigation menu to be very clear and organized and feature your top categories and any index that you might have, whether that's a recipe index or a travel index. Your navigation really Google's eyes into your site and your site structure.\
\
[00:20:07.890] - Madison\
When it comes to your blog posts themselves, I find that using a table of contents on longer posts, especially anything over 1,000 words, can be really helpful for readers to find what they're looking for, or just to browse what it is that you have in that post so they can decide whether it's worth their time to read or not. And the best part about all of this, all of these examples of what I just said for organizing your blog, is that all of these things are going to help with your internal linking of your site structure, which Google is going to love as well. So, when it comes to having an organized website, focus on making sure that your categories are organized, your navigation is clean and organized, that you're having categories for each of the different buckets of content that you share, and then utilize things like a table of contents to make it really easy for your readers to digest your content. The second part of your website optimization is really focusing on a little something called E.E.A.T. Now, E.E.A.T is basically whether or not you are demonstrating that you have expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\
\
[00:21:16.840] - Madison\
This is now a huge ranking factor for Google, and it's really important to make sure that this is a priority on your website. Google and your readers want to know that you are, one, a real person, but two, that you know what you are talking about. That is why in the food blogging space, especially, things like having process photos have become so important, having really detailed instructions about substitutions or storing the food, and things like that. All of that has become important because Google wants you to demonstrate your expertise in your topic. They do not want to just have random people who are making blogs and throwing up content that is not helpful in the long term for readers. The good thing about this, though, is you don't have to have any special degree. You don't have to have a fancy culinary degree or anything like that in order to showcase expertise. All you have to do is really show why you have knowledge in a subject. So, even if it's personal knowledge that you've just learned over time, that's still knowledge and expertise. You just have to share that with your readers and with Google through the different 'About' sections on your website.\
\
[00:22:22.520] - Madison\
I also want you to consider sharing content that has you in it. That shows that you are a real person - that AI did not create this content, but a real person did. If it's something like you being in the frame of the photo, maybe it's your hands making a recipe. It's you on the beach in the travel post that you're talking about. It's you making the DIY project. Whatever it is that can bring you into it. This doesn't have to be something you do on every single blog post, but make it frequent enough that it's obvious to your readers and to Google that a real person is behind this blog. You also want to make sure to highlight any reputable features that your blog has. If you have been mentioned in roundups by big companies, share that you have been featured in those places and share that on either a 'press' page or in an 'as seen on' section on your homepage. Anywhere that it's going to be obvious to somebody that you know what you're talking about and you create high-quality content. I also want you to make sure that you are optimizing the 'About' sections on your website.\
\
[00:23:27.300] - Madison\
I briefly mentioned that a second ago. You want to have things like your real photo of you, a high-quality photo. It doesn't have to be a professional branding photo shoot, but something that doesn't look like it was taken 10 years ago on an iPhone. You want it to be professional and up to date and what you look like now. You also want to make sure you have your first and last name. Again, we want to show that you are a real person, and saying that your blog is by Sally Q is not as relevant as having your full name there so that I could google you if I wanted to learn more about you. And then lastly, in those 'About' sections, make sure you are linking to your 'About' page, which is going to have more information about who you are and why your blog is helpful to your readers. The last section that we're going to dive into is creating an engaging experience for your readers on your website. It's hard to say which is the most important of all these things I've talked about, but this is the thing that I think is key - if you want to create a good experience for your reader, is finding a way to engage them with your content.\
\
[00:24:27.820] - Madison\
I've talked about this at length in my podcast, which is called The Vine Podcast, where I talk about things like user experience. But you really want to make sure you are creating a distraction-free environment for your readers. Now, of course, we have ads, we have pop-ups, we have things that we are sharing with our readers, so we're going to have some level of distraction, but we want it to still remain professional and limit the distractions as much as we can. So often I find that people don't even know that they have five or six things happening all at once in the first load of the website, because we are so used to looking at our website when we're logged in, or once we've cleared through all of those things, that we forget those things are happening for somebody who's brand new. So, make sure that you're not having a ton of those things happening on the first load of your site. And then you also want to make sure you are giving your readers what they want. I am sure you have seen all of the memes about food bloggers going on and on about their grandmother's birthday party and all of these things that aren't relevant to the recipe, but there's a reason for that.\
\
[00:25:33.650] - Madison\
Our society, unfortunately, has a very short attention span, and so we want to make sure we are getting people right to the heart of the content that they want. That's why jump-to-recipe button are so popular now. But even if you're not in the recipe space, there are things that apply to this as well. You might be a lifestyle blogger who can talk a little bit more about your life, but you want to also remember that people's time is very valuable. And so, if they're coming to you for your list of recommended products, make it really easy for them to get to those and to see them, and make sure that you are just creating an experience where it's easy for people to get to what they want. It's really about finding the sweet spot between having these things that generate revenue for our business, like pop-up ads or pop-ups, to grow our email list or ads and things like that, and creating an experience that our readers want to come back for. So, all that to say, make it really easy for people to get to the content they came for and utilize the space around that content.\
\
[00:26:33.340] - Madison\
So, if you're a recipe blogger, use your recipe card as the area in which you put important information, or important action steps that people need to take. Because that's what they're coming to your site for and they may not see the rest of the stuff in between until they are really committed to reading the blog post, and you want to make sure that you're getting their attention before they pop off and go do something else. Another really cool way that you can focus on engagement on your website is using things like block patterns. If you are not familiar with block patterns, this is a tool that is built into WordPress. This is a great way for you to add background colors, change font sizes, add graphics, all those kinds of fun things to jazz up the way that your blog post looks, which is going to help people to be engaged. It's helping to showcase your professional brand. And again, just help people to pay attention because they are moving fast, and they probably are not going to see your important content unless you make it really easy for them to see it and pay attention to it.\
\
[00:27:30.120] - Madison\
And then lastly, I briefly mentioned this, but make sure that you have a clear call to action around the main content of your blog post so that people will see it and hopefully take action - whether that is something like, 'Go and browse my recipe index; go and check out this other related blog post; leave a comment; share the post,' et cetera. Whatever it is that you want them to do, focus on putting that as close to the main part of the content that they're going to be paying attention to as you can. Now, if listening to this, you are sitting here and thinking, 'Wow, all of that sounds amazing, but I have a lot of work to do on my website. My website is not optimized in this way, and I don't even know where to start.' I want to share that the newest way that we are working with bloggers of all niches is through our crafted website offer. And crafted websites are basically built for bloggers who are looking to scale their blog to the next level. They want to focus on engaging their readers and creating a user experience that is memorable for their readers.\
\
[00:28:29.320] - Madison\
They also want to create a really unique look for their brand and not just be using the same pre-made themes that all of the bloggers are using. This is our budget-friendly way of working with us to create a customized website for your blog to take it to that next level. And so, I will put a link in the chat for you to check out our crafted websites. And if that is something that is of interest to you, we would love to chat with you and see if it is a good fit for us to work together. Now, I know that you are having so much information dropped on you this week, and my goal is always to really simplify things for my clients, for the people who listen to my podcast, and for you for being a part of this presentation. So, we have consolidated everything I've said in the last 30 minutes to you down into a little one-page PDF that you can download that has your quick action steps that you need to take for each of these things that we've talked about today. It is really the too-long, didn't read or too-long, didn't listen version of this presentation, because I had so much that I wanted to share with you today, and I tried to keep it as brief as I could, but I know it is a lot to take in.\
\
[00:29:34.500] - Madison\
So, if you are interested in downloading that PDF, I would love for you to do that. You can head over to graceandvinestudios.com/bbs2024, and I will put the link in the show notes for that as well, to download that free checklist to help you be able to take action on these four things that we've talked about today. And just to remind you, in case you got lost in all of this talking, we talked today about the four things that you should focus on after qualifying for ads, and these four things that you focus on are going to really help propel your business to the next level and take your blog to that next level. So, that is building your brand and your email list, implementing keyword research, figuring out what keyword level you are at, diversifying your revenue streams, and then finally optimizing your website. Again, if you want to download that free one-page PDF, you can go to graceandvinestudios.com/bbs 2024. Thank you, friends, for being here with me today. I hope that we can connect and I would love to hear about your blog in the comments or through connecting with me over on Instagram.\
\
[00:30:38.560] - Madison\
Thanks so much for being here today, and I hope that you learned at least one thing to go and take your business to the next level.\

[00:00:10.280] - Monica Louie, monicalouie.com\
Hey, hey, I'm Monica Louie, thank you so much for joining me for this session at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm so honored and excited to have you here.\
\
[00:00:20.510] - Monica\
So today we are talking about how to build a blogging business that scales to six figures and beyond. And as I mentioned, ironically, I'm a Facebook and Instagram Ads Atrategist. And while I'm not a "blogger" today, my business has served many six, seven and eight figure online businesses, including many successful online bloggers. And I also started off as a blogger myself. So I'm honored to be here with you today. Here is what we are going to cover today.\
\
[00:00:52.100] - Monica\
I'm going to share the five key elements to building a thriving and sustainable online business. I'm going to break down the seven essential steps for creating and scaling a six figure business. So this is how to incorporate those five key elements and really take action.\
\
[00:01:09.710] - Monica\
And I'm going to share why you don't need a website when you're just starting out.\
\
[00:01:15.350] - Monica\
Yes, it's true. And I'll explain why. And a little bit.\
\
[00:01:18.680] - Monica\
And along the way, I'll be sharing my top recommended resources to help you take action and scale to six figures and beyond. And I hope you've downloaded your accompanying worksheet as we go through this training. I hope that you take action after the training and really fill out all those questions. It will help you incorporate what I'm about to share with you today into your own online blogging business so that you can grow and scale to six figures and beyond. So just a little bit about me.\
\
[00:01:49.860] - Monica\
As I mentioned, I started off as a blogger myself, and my blog was called Our Debt Free Family sharing my family's journey out of debt.\
\
[00:01:58.700] - Monica\
In two short years, my husband and I paid off $120,000 of debt, all on a single middle class income. And as we started paying off the debt really quickly, it was after I left my job to be a stay-at-home mom with my two little-bitty kids. But my goal was to build a business from home. But I had no idea what I could do.\
\
[00:02:18.470] - Monica\
Well, after I left my job, we started paying off the debt and people were asking us how we were doing it. So I figured I'd started to learn about online business and blogging and I figured it was a great way to help people and hopefully inspire them to take action to get out of debt for their families as well.\
\
[00:02:33.830] - Monica\
So that's how I started with Our Debt Free Family and I dove in learning from people like Pat Flynn and Amy Porterfield. And I actually learned the value and power of Facebook and Instagram Ads from Amy Porterfield herself, which led me to eventually selling my blog and diving in to be a full time Facebook Ads coach in the beginning.\
\
[00:02:57.740] - Monica\
And now I have an agency with a virtual team of team members all across the United States, and we serve our online business clients, many of whom are bloggers and many amazing brands. This is just a sampling of some of the brands that we've worked with over the past few years. But I ended up selling my blog because I started off helping people with their own Facebook ads and realized that I really enjoyed helping other people grow their businesses. So that's why I sold the blog and dove full force headfirst into building my Facebook ads business.\
\
[00:03:32.660] - Monica\
I'm also the creator of Flourish with Facebook ads, which is my online training program to teach people how to create their own high converting Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns.\
\
[00:03:42.440] - Monica\
So let's get started. Let's dive right in to the five key elements to building a thriving and sustainable business. So as you've seen, I've worked with many successful businesses over the past several years and I have my own multi six figure business. We've been multiple six figures in annual revenue for the last several years. So I learned a lot. When I think about what really leads to the success in the online space, what really leads to building a thriving and sustainable business.\
\
[00:04:11.660] - Monica\
Most of the successful businesses that I've encountered, that I've seen in the online space that I've worked with, have these five key elements. So that's why I want to share them with you.\
\
[00:04:21.290] - Monica\
So the first one is you've got to have the right mindset. You've got to have the, "I'm going to figure this out. I'm going to make it happen." Kind of mindset. You've got to have the confidence in yourself. If you're just starting out, you've got to believe that you can become a six figure CEO.\
\
[00:04:38.310] - Monica\
You've got to believe that you can make it happen and understand there will be challenges along the way. A lot of times I see people quit because there seems to be a challenge that comes up. It's too big. It's too, too much to overcome or it feels like it's too much to overcome. And they just give up and maybe they give up on their business or they give up on a strategy that if they just continued with it, maybe tried a couple of different things, that they would have made it work.\
\
[00:05:04.670] - Monica\
And the most successful business owners have the mindset. Figuring it out and being committed to their business, so a couple of resources that I will share with you, a couple of my favorite books. Great, by Angela Duckworth. This is a fantastic book about the power of passion and perseverance. You've got to have this mindset of perseverance in your business if you're going to grow and scale to six figures and beyond.\
\
[00:05:30.840] - Monica\
And then The Magic of Thinking Big by David J Schwartz. This book, I think I first heard it recommended by Tim Ferris a few years ago. And it's a fantastic book. It's it's many decades old, but everything in this book still applies today, and it definitely applies to setting yourself on the path to building a six figure plus business.\
\
[00:05:54.690] - Monica\
So the second key is to really understand your avatar. And I will definitely go into this more because this is such a critical component. But you've got to understand who your avatar is, what's important to them, what are their pain points. And so I'll give you some resources later on where you can take action on this key element.\
\
[00:06:14.220] - Monica\
The third key element is you've got to have a high quality offer. Many successful businesses, I mean, every successful business, they have a high quality offer. If they don't have a high quality offer, then people are not going to pay them money. So as you're just starting out, think about what can, what a high quality offer can be for your ideal customer avatar. And we'll talk about some ideas today as well.\
\
[00:06:36.120] - Monica\
So just getting started, it could be an affiliate product on your blog. That's the easiest way, I think, to get started by offering a high quality offer and getting paid for it. If you're not getting paid, you don't have a business. If you are just blogging, blogging, and blogging and you're not getting paid you don't have a business yet, you have a hobby. So that's why I want you to think about what you can get paid for. So it could be a physical product, it could be a digital product like a course or an e-book or software or it could be a service.\
\
[00:07:08.100] - Monica\
When I started off with my Facebook Ads business, I started off first with a service doing one-on-one coaching, teaching people how to create campaigns on their own and coaching them along the way. So I started off in this business as with a service in my blogging business. I had affiliate offers and also I offered a service with my financial coaching. So think about what you can incorporate into your blogging business.\
\
[00:07:35.700] - Monica\
So the next key element is marketing. You've got to fall in love with marketing. You absolutely, I know a lot of people want to kind of shy away from this piece, but you don't have a business if people aren't paying you and if they don't know about you and what you're offering, then they're not going to pay you. So marketing is the action or business of promoting and selling products or services.\
\
[00:07:57.120] - Monica\
So a few resources here for you. Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller. This is one of my top most recommended books. This is a fantastic book. He's also got a Podcast, a course he does workshops. He's got a lot of things around this concept of the brand script, which is this process that he takes you through in this book. And I loved it so much that I incorporated this into my business.\
\
[00:08:20.130] - Monica\
So on my agency side of my business, my team and I go through the brand script process that he outlines in this book with every single new client that we bring on board so that we can really understand who their ideal customer is and how we can best position their products, their offering, offerings to their ideal customer through the Facebook ad. So I can't recommend this book enough.\
\
[00:08:47.090] - Monica\
Another one, Great Marketer, Russell Branson, Expert Secrets, absolutely love this book, but all of his books are fantastic. Then there's Contagious, which I don't hear mentioned a lot, but I think it's a fantastic book by Jonah Berger. It really, so, as the subtitle implies, why things catch on. It really explains what makes people gravitate towards specific social media posts or different specific offerings. I think it's really a fascinating book for marketers to read and understand, and then also a wonderful book for marketing to really understand the psychology of persuasion, as it says called Influence by Robert Giardini.\
\
[00:09:27.930] - Monica\
And so this is where he introduced in this book. I think he was the first one to introduce the, the ideas of scarcity and urgency, or at least he was the first one to bring attention to them. Scarcity and urgency and many other elements that can help you in your marketing and letting people know why your offer is the best offer for them and how to you persuade them to take action now as opposed to putting that off. So some amazing resources for you there.\
\
[00:09:57.210] - Monica\
And then the fifth and final key element is recurring revenue. Yes, we want revenue in our business, but it's better to have recurring revenue.\
\
[00:10:06.870] - Monica\
That's how you build a thriving and sustainable business so that you know what revenue you can expect month after month after month, and then, of course, we want to grow that revenue, but it's great to have a baseline revenue amount that, you know, you can expect so that you can plan.\
\
[00:10:22.430] - Monica\
What are you going to invest in? You can go through a training. You can hire a coach. You can do, make these investments very consciously and aware because you know that you've got the money coming in your business. So a few different ways that you can build a recurring revenue into your business is to have an evergreen sales funnel.\
\
[00:10:40.310] - Monica\
So this is where you'll make a sale once to one customer. But you've got this evergreen sales funnel running so that, you know, it's driving sale after sale after sale. You're getting consistent sales.\
\
[00:10:51.860] - Monica\
You can offer monthly services like I do so with my ads management plans, with my, on my ad agency side of my business. They pay us monthly for the service that we provide, which is their, their Facebook and Instagram, ad management and creation. And so we know when they when they on board, they sign a contract for a specific length of time to work with us. And so we are committed to working together during that length of time.\
\
[00:11:17.840] - Monica\
So I know when they signed the contract that I can rely on that revenue in my business coming month after month after month. And so it just helps you have that confidence that you're not wondering where your next dollar, where your next sale is going to come. It's really great to have that. So that's one way to build recurring revenue. Another really popular way to build recurring revenue is through a membership.\
\
[00:11:38.000] - Monica\
You can create a membership program and it could be a low dollar membership where it's an easy "yes" for somebody to get started and, and join your membership. And they get a ton of value for a very low price. But then over month after month after month, you know, your rate of retention, you know how many members you have in your membership, and then you know how much you can rely on month after month. Another way to do this is to have a payment plan.\
\
[00:12:05.090] - Monica\
So I know Amy Porterfield, she had some courses. She offered at about a thousand dollars for each course.\
\
[00:12:11.750] - Monica\
And, you know, that's a pretty significant amount of money for people to put down in one lump sum. And so what she did is she offered a 12 month payment plan at $97 a month. So it made that investment to take her course and apply it to your business so much easier to take on. So much easier to to do, because it's a much smaller amount when compared to a thousand dollars. So it made it really easy for people to say yes to purchasing her product.\
\
[00:12:44.840] - Monica\
But then she knew for 12 months she was going to be receiving $97 a month from all the customers that signed up for that product. All right. So just a quick review of the five key elements. The first one is you've got to have the mindset. You've got to understand there will be challenges in building your business, but commit to working through those challenges.\
\
[00:13:06.710] - Monica\
You can figure it out, you can't figure it out. You can't, you got to know that you have the confidence you will figure this out and you will grow your business. And if you're like me, you are growing your business to help other people.\
\
[00:13:19.490] - Monica\
So keep that in mind as you're growing your business, as you hit challenges, that there are people out there who need your help, that if you just pursue, you persevere and figure it out, you will be able to help more people with your business and your offerings.\
\
[00:13:33.770] - Monica\
The second one is to understand your ideal customer avatar. Third one is to have a high quality offer that helps people get results. The fourth one is your marketing.\
\
[00:13:44.960] - Monica\
Got to love your marketing. You've got to have your marketing machine.\
\
[00:13:47.360] - Monica\
We're going to talk about that here in a minute too. And then build in recurring revenue. See how you can build recurring revenue into your business model. If you don't have it already, it can really help you have that confidence in investing in your business to grow it.\
\
[00:14:03.080] - Monica\
So let's put this all together.\
\
[00:14:04.880] - Monica\
I'm going to share with you the seven essential steps for creating and scaling your six figure business. So this is for creating, you're going to, if you are just starting out and you don't have a business yet, I invite you to think strongly about going through each step, in order. If you already have a business off the ground, then maybe you did things in a little bit different order and that's OK. But think through these seven steps and figure out which ones maybe you need to spend more time on to really grow and scale your business.\
\
[00:14:35.160] - Monica\
OK, so the first one is you're going to develop a skill, service, or product the people will pay for. Again, you do not have a business if people are not paying you money for an offering, in exchange for an offering, for a service, for a product.\
\
[00:14:51.500] - Monica\
So you need to develop your skill or your service or your product so that people can pay you money for it. That's the first one. Again, you've got to have an offer the people will pay you for. All right.\
\
[00:15:04.640] - Monica\
Step two is start helping people and produce fantastic results. So as you start working with people, you have them go through your course, you have them go through your e-book, you work with them one on one, like I did one of my coaching business when I first got started with Facebook Ads coaching, you will learn one of their questions.\
\
[00:15:23.810] - Monica\
How can you make this better? And you will learn whether they are getting the results that they're expecting from this offering or if you need to make tweaks. And so you've got to start helping people incorporate their feedback and help them produce fantastic results.\
\
[00:15:38.930] - Monica\
Then you can move to next, to step three. So when I first started, step three is niche down and understand your avatar. So it's really important to niche down. When I first started with Facebook ads coaching, I started helping people in the online personal finance space. Many personal finance bloggers are reaching out for my help. But then as more people learned that I was a Facebook ads coach, more people in different niches, different types of businesses started reaching out for my help with their Facebook Ads. So at first I said yes to anybody who wanted to hire me to help them with their Facebook Ads.\
\
[00:16:14.420] - Monica\
But as I kind of tested the waters with different different types of business owners, different business models and their Facebook ad strategy, I learned that really I was getting the best results in helping personal finance bloggers. I really understood their audience really well since I came from that space. But I also understood the strategy and I was really perfecting it really well. So I was getting amazing results time after time with with those types of clients. So I decided to specifically focus on personal finance bloggers.\
\
[00:16:45.080] - Monica\
And now as my business has grown a few years later, we definitely work with online businesses outside of the personal finance space. We still have some personal finance clients, but we definitely work with online businesses in all kinds of different industries. But we are still niche down in the fact that we focus on online businesses with digital products because we know that we can serve them really well. So you want to stay in your specialty and your experience and where you know that you're helping people get results.\
\
[00:17:16.760] - Monica\
So it's OK to start off if you're just getting started with testing the waters with different types of avatars, but then really focus in on who do you want to work with?\
\
[00:17:27.500] - Monica\
So think about that. So as I got started with my Facebook Ads coaching business, I knew I wanted to work with online business owners because that was my that was my experience becoming, you know, as a blogger myself and really learning and and geeking out about online business and marketing strategy. So I knew that I wanted to work with them. And and also I knew that I had a great network in the personal finance blogging space.\
\
[00:17:49.580] - Monica\
And who will pay you. Who will actually give you money for your offerings. Think about that. That's a really important element that a lot of people don't think of as they're getting started. They know they've got an experience or a specialty or some kind of skill that they can offer. And, but they don't think about if their ideal avatar will actually pay them. So those two things have to be there. And then who knows? They need your help. So your sale, your offering is going to be a whole lot easier to sell if people know that they need your help.\
\
[00:18:22.010] - Monica\
This doesn't have to be there, but it's a whole lot easier to make the sale if it's there. So when I first started with Facebook ads coaching back in the end of 2016, early 2017, Facebook ads was a really hot strategy. It still is today. A lot of people really want to incorporate Facebook ads into their business, but is a really hot strategy in the personal finance blogging space. A lot of people were really curious about how they could incorporate Facebook Ads into their strategy to grow their blogs and their online businesses.\
\
[00:18:53.810] - Monica\
And so that's why it made it easier for me to get clients because they were coming to me, because they knew that they needed my help and because I was niche down. I served so many people in the personal finance blogging space, they knew that I was the person to go to.\
\
[00:19:07.850] - Monica\
And I still get clients and prospects reaching out to me in the personal finance blogging space because I've made a name for myself as the Facebook expert in that niche. So it really helps to niche down. You don't have to stay niche down forever, but it really helps when you're getting started if you niche down.\
\
[00:19:26.900] - Monica\
OK, so Understanding Your Avatars and Resources, Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller again. And then Will It Fly? By my coach and mentor, Pat Flynn. This is a fantastic book. I love how he has so many exercises in this book that will really help you get clear on who your avatar is, what the market is currently offering to them, where some gaps might be in the market that you can slide right in and serve a specific pain point or a need that is not being met currently in the market.\
\
[00:19:56.360] - Monica\
It's really a fantastic book, I think. Will it Fly? Should be required reading for all online businesses.\
\
[00:20:02.600] - Monica\
All right. So step four. So now you've got your product. Got your avatar.\
\
[00:20:08.730] - Monica\
And you are helping people get amazing results, then you should start gathering testimonials and then share them. So you need to ask your customers, ask your clients, for testimonials.\
\
[00:20:19.110] - Monica\
I'm sure by this point, maybe some people are already giving you some testimonials without even being asked. But you want to really be intentional about gathering these testimonials. And this is not something that you ever stop. This is something that you're always going to keep doing in your business. You're always going to be needing to gather testimonials. So just ask them for their feedback. Ask them if they can provide a testimonial. Maybe you put together a quick survey so that you can easily organize the testimonials, but start gathering those testimonials and then where are you going to share them?\
\
[00:20:50.670] - Monica\
Well, you want to put them all over your website, want to put them in your content. You want to share them in your emails, in your sales funnels and your sales pages and your work with me pages.\
\
[00:21:01.560] - Monica\
And I also I created a praise page as I was getting a lot of testimonials early on in my business, I decided I was just going to create a page where I could put most of them, or at least a lot of them. And then you can check it out at monicalouie.com/praise if you like. But I've got the name.\
\
[00:21:21.870] - Monica\
I've got their headshot and I've got their little, you know, quoted testimonial there. And it's just a page that can point people to they want to know what it's like to work with me or my experience. And it's great because a lot of people recognize many of the business owners that are there and the brands that are there. And so that really helps build credibility without me, you know, it's easier for somebody to be convinced of how great your offer is if somebody else is telling them who has the credibility as opposed to you being the credible source, telling them how how great your your offer is. So that's where testimonials come in. All right.\
\
[00:22:00.180] - Monica\
So step five is to create your visibility plan. So this is how we're going to start to push out our offering, let people, more people, know about what we have to offer with our visibility plan. All right.\
\
[00:22:16.560] - Monica\
So this is where you create your website. So we're all the way to step five. And I haven't talked about creating your website.\
\
[00:22:23.550] - Monica\
I did talk about, in step four, about sharing testimonials on your website. Now you're going to create your website. So, again, if you already have an established business and you're figuring , you're wanting to figure out how to grow and scale it, then maybe you've done a little bit of this out of order.\
\
[00:22:36.210] - Monica\
Totally fine. Totally fine. But if you're just starting new, this is how I suggest you get your business off the ground so you can begin making money early on so you're not focused on a hobby. You've got an actual running business. OK, so you create your website and you're going to create a lead magnet. So the lead magnet, I'm sure most of you are familiar with this term. This is a freebie, an offering in exchange for an email address.\
\
[00:23:04.320] - Monica\
So this is the way that you can grow your email list so that you can email people who are your customers or who are not yet your customers. So you can get back in front of them. You can stay top of mind so that when they're ready to move forward with your paid offering, they will think of you. So it's super important to grow your email list and you do that most cases with a lead magnet.\
\
[00:23:27.840] - Monica\
There are other ways where you can just offer your newsletter. Most of the time you'll have better conversions, better sign ups, more sign ups, to your email list if you're offering a lead magnet. So just some ideas for lead magnet could be a checklist, a guide, a quiz, a video training or a webinar.\
\
[00:23:46.170] - Monica\
Just some ideas. There are many, many different ideas that you can use as a lead magnet.\
\
[00:23:50.280] - Monica\
But it's a freebie, a free offering that people will receive in exchange for their email address.\
\
[00:23:57.720] - Monica\
OK, on your website, you also have to have a sales pag,e or work with me page, or somewhere on your website where people can see what your offering is and pay you money.\
\
[00:24:08.640] - Monica\
So if you're focused on affiliate marketing as bloggers, if you focus on affiliate marketing to start, then you're going to have your affiliate links probably throughout your content, throughout your blog post, your, your Podcast show notes. But you could also have a resources page where you have affiliate links as well, where you have maybe your, you know, your highest recommended tools or resources for your audience.\
\
[00:24:33.830] - Monica\
As you can see, I've already shared a whole bunch of resources with you in today's training, but so maybe you could create a resource page if your focus is on affiliate marketing or maybe that's a sub focus, but you've got to have these key elements of your website.\
\
[00:24:48.780] - Monica\
It can be very simple. And then dive into your content marketing plan. So, of course, you know this. It could be your blog, Podcast, a YouTube channel. It could be public speaking. So I've spoken at a lot of different conferences over the years and it's a great way to meet people, especially if you know that your avatar is there attending those conferences. Nowadays, a lot of, you know, in-person conferences are online, they're doing virtual events, but there's also online summits like this.\
\
[00:25:16.620] - Monica\
Speaking at a conference or a Summit or an online event is a great way to build instant credibility because they, the people who are putting on, hosting the event would not just invite anybody. Right. They're going to they're going to want to bring the best to their audience. Also, podcast interviews.\
\
[00:25:34.740] - Monica\
I've gotten a lot of clients over the years from doing podcast interviews. I've done a lot of different podcast interviews over the years.\
\
[00:25:41.490] - Monica\
And it's a great way to get my name out there, my brand, my offerings, but also share the stories. They can build a relationship with me and it's fun to do. I enjoy connecting with other people in the space. And so I think it's a lot of fun and it's kind of an easier way to get into putting yourself out there.\
\
[00:25:58.830] - Monica\
I find at least being an introvert myself and again, just like with speaking, podcasters aren't going to just invite anybody to their podcast so that can help build instant credibility as well.\
\
[00:26:10.680] - Monica\
And then guest posts. You can still do guest posts and get on other people's blogs so that you can get your name out there in features so you can get featured on CNBC or Business Insider or something like that.\
\
[00:26:23.700] - Monica\
Then that can serve as instant credibility as well.\
\
[00:26:26.670] - Monica\
And then for your visibility plan.\
\
[00:26:30.570] - Monica\
There's also paid advertising, which is of course my favorite form of pushing your content out there and getting in front of people, getting, you know, getting more people to become aware of you, your brand, your offerings. So you can do Facebook, Instagram ads, Pinterest, promoted pins, Google, YouTube.\
\
[00:26:53.130] - Monica\
And so those are just some of the ad platforms, most common ad platforms. My team and I, we help people with Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest ads when it applies to their business model. So, so paid advertising is a great way to get in front of more people.\
\
[00:27:11.460] - Monica\
All right. So step six is to develop your plan for scaling. So you got your content out there. How are you going to scale?\
\
[00:27:18.540] - Monica\
You know, you're getting testimonials, you know, your offerings are getting results. You niche down. You figured out who your avatar is and you understand their needs and you know how to position your offer as the best solution. So how are you going to scale your business now? Well, you have a couple of different options.\
\
[00:27:35.910] - Monica\
You could have more offerings or you could get more customers.\
\
[00:27:40.980] - Monica\
And I suggest scaling your first offer first and the way you do this, while the reason, before I get to the way you do this, the reason why you want to scale your first offer first is because a lot of us content creators, we get in the habit of creating content. We think, well, I created one product.\
\
[00:27:57.480] - Monica\
Now I can create another product. Now I can create another product.\
\
[00:27:59.880] - Monica\
We have all these product ideas that we just want to get out of us and get out into the world. But that means that we're putting the marketing of our initial product on the back burner.\
\
[00:28:10.350] - Monica\
And that can create confusion for us because we don't know which product to promote when. And it can also create confusion for our potential customers because there's so many different products to choose from.\
\
[00:28:23.070] - Monica\
How do I know which one is going to be the best suited for me in my stage of where I am at?\
\
[00:28:28.440] - Monica\
So I say keep it simple. Scale your offer first. And the best way to do that, I think, is by having a salesman also. This can become your evergreen sales funnel or you can do this with a live launch as well. So the sales funnel I'm going to go through with just the basic, basic elements of a sales funnel. And you can put this into like an email series and email autoresponder series, or you could put this in all in your webinar and your webinar training or video series.\
\
[00:28:58.650] - Monica\
But these are the basic elements of a sales funnel. So it initially starts with your lead magnet. What are they opting in for? What are they handing over their email address for in exchange for your freebie? And then introduce yourself and or your brand, then give value, give value, give value. You're building up that reciprocity because they're getting so much value from you. They're going to be more inclined to want to give you something in return.\
\
[00:29:26.010] - Monica\
Then you introduce the offer, you let them know that it's coming, then you make the offer. And along the way you want to be sharing testimonials and success stories. And then usually at the end, the offer expires, the bonus goes away, the discount goes away. There's some kind of end to the sales funnel that helps people get off the fence and make a decision. Are they in or are they out for now?\
\
[00:29:47.220] - Monica\
All right. So moving on to step seven. The seventh and final step is to drive traffic. This is how you're going to say, scale it up.\
\
[00:29:54.360] - Monica\
You're going to drive traffic to your sales funnel. So you could do organic traffic with SEO, Pinterest, media, which could be Podcast, interviews or guest posts or features or speaking.\
\
[00:30:09.030] - Monica\
So those are the organic forms of driving traffic, or again, my favorite form of driving traffic is via paid advertising with our friends Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google and YouTube ads. All right. So to break it down here, the seven essential steps develop a skill service or product people will pay for, start helping people and produce fantastic results, niche down and understand your avatar, gather testimonials and share them, create your visibility plans so more people can find you.\
\
[00:30:39.540] - Monica\
Develop your plan for scaling. How are you going to grow this thing and then drive traffic to scale on autopilot?\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.310] - Nayo Carter Gray, 1ststepaccounting.com\
Hi, welcome to Hobby VS Business, how to keep the IRS from disallowing your deductions. My name is Nayo Carter Gray. I am the owner and founder of First Step Accounting, where we make accounting a little less taxing for small business owners all across the US. We're located in Baltimore, Maryland, and we serve tons of small business owners. I am an enrolled agent. What that means is I'm licensed directly by the U.S. Treasury. I can handle tax matters in all 50 states. I am also currently sitting for the CPA exam. Covid kind of messed up my four-part test. I have one part left, so cross your fingers for me that I pass within the next couple of weeks. I do have an accounting degree, so accounting has been my livelihood and lifeline and for years I am a Quick Books online advanced certified proadvisor. I actually sat on the Intuit Accountants Counsel. I currently sit on their Trainers Writers Network. And what this means is that I actually help them build and develop the software, not only for accounting users, but also small business users. And I teach it nationally, again, not only to account users, but also small business users. I was named one of the top fifty cloud accountants by a company called Hubach two years in a row. Last year was named one of the top one hundred text Twitter accounts to follow by Forbes and just recently named by a practice technician as one of the top 50 women in accounting. So, I take accounting very seriously, and I love working for small business owners, which is why I am oh, I am so excited to be teaching this course.\
\
[00:01:56.830] - Nayo\
Now, small business owners are so notorious for not having good financial records, and it's because you guys are so busy building your businesses that you kind of forget and neglect the back office stuff. But I want to re-emphasize, and I'll keep saying this over and over the out time here, that having your finances and accounting records in working condition is going to be so huge, and beneficial for your business. Not only will it help you to manage your business, but it'll keep the IRS off your back, as you will learn today.\
\
[00:02:38.020] - Nayo\
So, having those good records, what they do is they actually legitimize your business, because if your business is ever classified as a hobby, it actually can limit how much in expenses you can deduct. And you will hear me again emphasize it is so important that your business has its accounting records in order, so that you do not get classified as a hobby.\
\
[00:03:06.610] - Nayo\
Now, if you own a business, I am strongly encouraging you to seek out an accounting professional. This course here is just general advice. And so if you want to tailor this conversation to your specific interest in your specific situation, you need to reach out to an accounting professional or tax professional. And I will give you my contact information later if you're in the market for one.\
\
[00:03:35.980] - Nayo\
Now, by the end of today's webinar, what you will learn are:\
\
[00:03:40.870] - Nayo\
The nine questions the IRS asked, in order to determine if your business is actually a business.\
\
[00:03:47.530] - Nayo\
How being classified as a hobby, impacts your tax return.\
\
[00:03:52.330] - Nayo\
And then, three things you can do right away, to ensure that your business avoids being classified as a hobby in the future.\
\
[00:04:01.540] - Nayo\
So, let's dive on in with the last questions. Question number one, do you carry on the activity in a business like manner? And this is so important because it will determine whether or not the IRS, will classify you as a hobby. And so, what does that mean to operate in a business like manner? It means that you have set hours, you are actually working on the business at certain times and people can get a hold of you using business communication methods, emails. Do you have a website? Do you have a telephone number that's not just your cell phone number that you use for business? Do you have business cards? All of those things can prove to the IRS that you're actually taking the business seriously and that you are operating in a business like manner.\
\
[00:04:59.230] - Nayo\
Now, as I go over these nine questions, I do want to iterate that none of these tests alone will make the determination whether or not the IRS treats you like a hobby, but it's like a combination of the questions. So, as we go through this list, you kind of think about how you're operating now and then what you can do to improve in the future.\
\
[00:05:23.200] - Nayo\
So, let's go head over to question number two. Does the time and effort you put into the activity indicate that you intend to make it profitable? What does that mean? That means are you actually taking time to sell your product or your service?\
\
[00:05:45.910] - Nayo\
Because, you know, we can have a business where we're buying a bunch of things and trying to write them off. But if you never make an effort to make a sale, then that screams to the IRS that this isn't a real business. So, again, do you have a website where people can hit the buy now button? Are you making calls to try to sell to people who would benefit from your product? You can prove that you are trying to actively sell the product via social media, via email, via the telephone. Then you will have a chance of winning this question over [laughs].\
\
[00:06:29.920] - Nayo\
The next question: Do you depend on the income from this activity for your livelihood?\
\
[00:06:38.470] - Nayo\
What does that mean? That means are you using the money you've earned in this business to pay your bills? And this is an important factor, because if you aren't, it could indicate that you could be just doing this for fun or again, you're just looking some write offs to try to minimize your other primary source of income, so I do again, and recommending that you have an accounting, a bookkeeping system, so that you can prove that the money you generated, you're spending to actually pay yourself to pay your bills, whether it's your mortgage, your car payment or something like that.\
\
[00:07:17.980] - Nayo\
Like when I first started a business, I used to do level marketing and I started because I wanted to pay my car note. I had just purchased a brand new car, and I was very adamant that I didn't want to take my salary and pay that car note. And so I started multilevel marketing where I did two events a month that covered my car note and it wasn't a hobby because I was actually using it to pay the bills.\
\
[00:07:46.270] - Nayo\
So, if you can prove that you will have success in winning this question over the next question, are your losses due to circumstances beyond your control or are they normal in the startup phase of your business?\
\
[00:08:05.710] - Nayo\
Now, the IRS does realize and understand that not every business will make a profit, especially not in the beginning. So, they do make allowances for your business to have losses. And there are certain industries that just lose money all the time. So like, for example, if you buy, sell and trade horses or you raise them typically horse horse racers, I don't remember the technical term, but they are businesses do not turn a profit unless that horse actually wins one of the major races like the Preakness. So the IRS has rules in place where they understand that this type of business may not show profits in a number of years. And again, if you're just starting the business, they're not expecting you to come out the gate making six figures because they know you have to do things on it in order to generate sales.\
\
[00:09:01.930] - Nayo\
So, again, ask yourself, are your losses beyond your control or are you in the normal startup phase of the business? And if your answer is yes, you probably will win this question. But again, you have to be able to prove that you're attempting and trying really, really hard to turn a profit.\
\
[00:09:25.150] - Nayo\
Next question. Do you change your methods of operation in an attempt to improve profitability? So, remember, we talked about those losses. Are you now switching things up to try to minimize them as much as possible? So, have you increased your prices? Have you brought in new things to sell as add ons? Have you improved the product? So, did you do a beat around and then got feedback and made that product better than increase the price?\
\
[00:10:00.460] - Nayo\
So if you can prove that you actively are working on improving the profitability long term, then the IRS again will well look favorably upon this question. But if you're just charging the bare minimum for the product, then you know you're charging less than what it costs for you to make. That probably will indicate that you're not trying to turn a profit.\
\
[00:10:24.670] - Nayo\
So, again, the goal here is with businesses. Are you trying to make some money? Next question, do you or your advisers have the knowledge needed to carry on the activity as a successful business, so are you bringing on a team of professionals to work with you, alongside you to help you improve your process, improve the business, improve profitability?\
\
[00:10:58.460] - Nayo\
So, have you proven to hire someone so say bring on an accountant? Are you bringing someone on to help you look overall at your financial picture and make some assessments, and give you some advice about how to improve? If so, awesome. Are you taking courses? If you're a do it yourself or are you taking courses to improve the information you already know and make it better and take it to the next level? If so, awesome, you'll be able to win this question over. But if you are trying to hire a plumber to do accounting, that may not go over so well. So, when you're looking at your team and looking at not being classified as a hobby, you want to make sure that the people you're hiring or working with have the insight, the info and the knowledge to take your business up to the next level.\
\
[00:11:53.680] - Nayo\
Next question. Were you successful in making a profit in similar activities in the past? Now, if this isn't your first rodeo and this isn't your first business and you've done this before, were you able to turn a profit in the past because the IRS knows people, you may start one business and stop it and then go on to the next one. But if you're constantly having these failing businesses, then maybe business isn't for you. Maybe you are just running a hobby. And so they want to make sure that people who aren't really good at business aren't benefiting from, you know, just playing around in business and pretending like they want to be in business and getting all these write offs when the intent is really never to make a profit.\
\
[00:12:42.550] - Nayo\
So again, where are you able to make a profit in the past? If so, that looks a little favorable on you. So, don't try to show losses for multiple businesses. Multiple years is just not a good look next. That's the activity. Make a profit in some years. And how much profit does it make?\
\
[00:13:07.270] - Nayo\
So, again, the IRS knows that we have years where your income just may not be as favorable as the year before. Did one of your products go viral and explode in one year and then the next year kind of fell flat? If so, that's totally fine, because the idea, again, behind this is that you're actually making every effort you can to improve that profitability every single day, every single month, every single year. You're not just buying stuff and never selling again because your product is no longer viral.\
\
[00:13:45.220] - Nayo\
So make sure that you're documenting how you're trying to sell and who you're trying to sell to and then, you know, keeping track of all of that income as well as your expenses, because it'll be important to determine the answers for all of these tests.\
\
[00:14:04.420] - Nayo\
Next and last. Can you expect to make a future profit from the appreciation of the assets used in the activity? And this one is less dive a little deeper because it's like, what? What are we talking about here? So, first off, we're talking about assets. We hear quite often that people buy equipment for their business.\
\
[00:14:29.950] - Nayo\
Now, is the equipment that you're purchasing going to be a benefit to the business to make your profits increase? So, are they going to appreciate which means go up in value to make your business run better? So, for example, if you run a snowball stand and you buy a vehicle, if you buy a Lamborghini, how is that going to benefit the business? Because snowball stands don't need Lamborghinis. You probably could benefit from a pickup truck that has a hitch on it where you can pull a trailer or be able to use the back of the cab to be able to buy supplies in bulk. So, think about the items and the supplies and the equipment you're buying and your business and ask yourself, is this going to help increase my profit or is this something that I am just wanting just because and it has no benefit to the business? So, keep this in mind. This is the last question is, is actually one of the more important ones? Because I know we get advice all the time to small business owners that you need to buy the right equipment. So, making sure that equipment is ordinary and necessary and that is actually going to help you increase your profits is huge and key.\
\
[00:15:49.480] - Nayo\
Now, I go over all of these questions because if you're classified as a hobby, it has a different impact on your tax return versus you being classified as a business, and it's not in a good way. So, being classified as a hobby means you get absolutely zero business deductions. Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed a couple of years ago, it eliminated the section of the tax return where you could, in fact, deduct any hobby expenses. And then in the past, those hobby losses were still limited by 2% of your what's called your adjusted gross income. And they had to meet like a threshold if you itemize versus the standard deduction.\
\
[00:16:41.650] - Nayo\
So, as you hear, it's not simple. It's a little complex. Oh, it was a little complex. Now, if your business is classified as a hobby, you get. Absolutely. Zero deductions. Nadda. Nilch. It's not happening, but you will be required to report the total happy income so you don't get to write the expenses off, but you got to pay taxes off on the income. That's not cool because think about it. You've spent money on these expenses. Don't you want to be able to deduct them against the income you've earned? Like, I would be devastated if I spent a bunch of money on expenses for my business and the business got classified as a hobby. And then I didn't get to take any deductions, but I had to pay taxes on that income. So, I don't want that to happen to you. So, make sure you're reviewing these nine questions and checking things off on your list to make sure that you're operating as a business and not in jeopardy of being classified as a hobby.\
\
[00:17:45.670] - Nayo\
Now, I'm going to give you a few tips on how to avoid being classified as a hobby, and making sure that your business is operating as a legit business.\
\
[00:17:59.680] - Nayo\
So, first things first. I want you to keep track of all your appointments and why is this important? One, it shows that you are operating professional like so you have a calendar. Here's the schedule. Also, you could be keeping track of the time you're spending on the activities in your business. So, I love time trackers, but I just put a few of the major schedulers on the screen here. Google Calendar is probably one of the more popular ones where you can, you know, sync up with other people, and making sure that you two are meeting at the same time. And some of the other more popular ones. Calendaly, Book like a Boss, Vcita, MeetFox, and Microsoft Team bookings. So, all of those will allow you to be able to operate your business in a professional like manner where your scheduling with clients and customers and and keeping track of it, because generally you can print out a report that proves what your schedule looks like.\
\
[00:19:03.200] - Nayo\
So, if you're working a nine to five and then you come home and you're working on that business and you are setting up appointments again, you got a nice Canva record to say this is what I did and this is how I did it, and this is who I met with.\
\
[00:19:19.720] - Nayo\
And then I love the scheduling software because they can automate things. So, one of the things I am most passionate about is about automating and delegating and making things easy. Breezy Lemon. So, first things first. Make sure you are keeping track of all your appointments and tracking your time that you're spending in the business.\
\
[00:19:44.110] - Nayo\
Next up, use a separate bank account for your business and personal transactions. When you put those things together, if all of those things are jumbled up in one bank account, the IRS calls this comingling. And this is a no-no, because then they get to come in and say, "Hey, we don't know which transactions are actually business. So, they're all personal." So, we want to avoid that at all cost by making sure you separate them. So, it doesn't have to be a fancy business bank account. It can be another separate checking account that you use at the same bank you bank with personally. And I quite often recommend that to business owners who operate a single member LLC or have a sole proprietorship, because it just makes it easy and convenient for you to be able to transfer money between the two accounts.\
\
[00:20:39.820] - Nayo\
So, if you're using the income for your livelihood and all of your personal expenses are coming out a different account, then as you're earning income, that income funnels into this new separate bank account and then you just transfer over what you need to your personal account. Plus, you'll have the benefit of keeping all the expenses for the business in that one account. And when it comes time to track it, it makes it super, super simple because they're all neatly tied in one account, one by one place to check. This not only goes for your bank accounts, but it also goes for your PayPal accounts. And I know, my small business owners are so famous for commingling the PayPal account with personal business transactions. But I highly recommend you set up two separate accounts and use one for personal and one for business. I can't reiterate this enough.\
\
[00:21:38.350] - Nayo\
And for the love of all things, please do not use cash for business or Venmo. Both of these are actually personal accounts and in their terms of service is a violation. If you use it for business, I do know that cash does have a business version, which is nothing but square. So, if you're going to use one of these apps to collect payments from your customers, make sure you are using the business versions and again, separating them from your personal transactions.\
\
[00:22:16.830] - Nayo\
Lastly, and the most important one, I will advocate this every day, all day, because I know how this will help you not only keep your business classified as a business, but it will also help you build and grow your business. It will help you stay in compliance for all things tax. It is creating a formal bookkeeping system. And I will say it again. This is one of the things I will always highly encourage and recommend, because it not only helps you stay in compliance with taxes, but it also helps you manage the business and keep your business classified as a business.\
\
[00:23:00.990] - Nayo\
So, you may be currently using in an informal bookkeeping system, which is using something like an Excel spreadsheet or a Google sheets or numbers, pages, whatever it is that you're using that isn't automated, that has a lot of manual data entry; that is called an informal bookkeeping system. And it's nothing wrong with that. You can totally start there. However, I want you to take it to the next level and prove that your business is operating as a business by setting up a formal bookkeeping system. And most of you are familiar with Quickbook's as probably one of the more popular apps out there for the bookkeeping systems. But there's some other options out there. You can look at Wave Accounting, you can look at Sage, or you can look at Xero. All of these are cloud based apps that will help you manage the accounting and bookkeeping for your business. And I like these systems, one, because, like I mentioned, they they will automate your- automate the process for you. What they normally do is link with your bank account and pull in those transactions, so that you don't have to manually key anything. Because the issue with manually typing data is what happens if you type something wrong. Where is the checks and balances? There aren't any. But with a formal bookkeeping system, it'll pull in that data for you so you don't have to manually type anything. And there's a way to reconcile monthly, so that way you can just verify that the information in the bookkeeping system is actually what happened. And then at the end of the year, you have the beautiful financial statement that you can use to then file your tax return. Or if you're trying to do something like get a loan, here's a financial statement that you can print out for your loan officer or your banker and say, "This is how well my business is doing." They will appreciate and love that, because then you look like a professional. You have a document here that is showcasing how your business is doing. Then also, you can use this to make management decisions. How will you know what your business is doing if you don't know your numbers?\
\
[00:25:21.720] - Nayo\
So, if you've ever watched a show like Shark Tank, you know, that's one of the first things they ask. Do you know your numbers? So, having a formal bookkeeping system will allow you to be able to pull that information directly from your bank, manipulate it into a beautiful profit and loss statement, a balance sheet, and look and see how well or how bad your business is doing, so that you can make improvement and change your processes. And again, this will keep the IRS off your back.\
\
[00:25:51.090] - Nayo\
You have a profit and loss statement. This kind of legitimizes what you're doing. And that's the whole point of this webinar today, is to teach you how to legitimize it so that you understand exactly what it is you want to avoid at all costs so that your business does not get classified as a hobby. So, I'm going to say this once again, set up that formal bookkeeping system. It is imperative.\
\
[00:26:19.830] - Nayo\
Now, I do you have a special offer for you because you've stuck it out this long and listen to me, blah, blah, blah, all about the IRS and the things they look for in order to not give you the deductions you are entitled to. That I want to offer my assistance for if you need extra help in this way. And how am I going to do that? I have a special course called "The Business a Bookkeeping Boot Camp". And what it does is we kind of go over some of the accounting basics so that when you are setting up their formal bookkeeping system, you know exactly what it is that you're doing.\
\
[00:27:08.670] - Nayo\
So, there are three handed lessons. Lesson one focuses on income and cost of goods sold. Now showcase this wonderful what I call a "love letter from the IRS". When you're not reporting your income correctly, you could get one of these notices is called the CP2000 notice. And as you see on the screen, she got a notice saying that she owed thousands of dollars. Now, what would you do if you saw a letter like this? Probably freak out like she did. And luckily for her, she hired me and I got this number down immensely. By the time it was over, she only owed a couple of hundred dollars. And again, it was because she didn't report her income correctly. So, in the Business Bookkeeping Bootcamp, we teach you how to report all of the income that you're supposed to. We also go over the cost of goods. And what that means is if you're selling a product, you need to know the value of those products and what's actually tax deductible, because it may not always be the all the things that you purchase. You may have to spread those costs out. But again, we teach that in the course.\
\
[00:28:17.680] - Nayo\
The next lesson focuses on the expenses. Expenses are huge because there are some things that will just trigger an IRS audit because they just look wonky. So, if we look at these expenses here, a website that costs almost $20,000, that's like a big red flag. So, I go over in this course the general business expenses that most businesses are eligible for, and we talk about what it means for them to be ordinary and necessary in order to be tax deductible.\
\
[00:28:53.290] - Nayo\
And lastly, we cover some tricky tax topics and there are a few of them that I like to reiterate over and over to make sure that you understand exactly what's required in order to take those deductions. Because if you take them incorrectly, they could trigger a red flag for the IRS and trigger that audit. And we want to avoid that. Plus, with the pandemic hitting and we received all of these stimulus packages and PPP loans, there are some other things that are coming down the pipeline that will impact your tax return for your business income and expenses. So I want to make sure you know exactly what those are.\
\
[00:29:36.370] - Nayo\
Now, as a bonus, if you buy the course, you'll get a Facebook group with me and other small business owners where we talk about some of these topics throughout the year. You get lifetime access to any updates or improvements I make to the course and you get a free bonus course on how to find the right bookkeeper if you're in the market for a new bookkeeper.\
\
[00:30:00.400] - Nayo\
Now, how much is this going to cost? Well, today for you only with the special discount code, "Breakthrough" it is only going to be $99. 12 months of bookkeeping, this course alone and the Facebook group will cost you over $3000. So, this is a steal and again, it's a tax write off and is helping you prove that your business is a business because then you're trying to get the knowledge to make sure your back office stuff is all set up. Right. And I hope to see you there.\
\
[00:30:35.160] - Nayo\
So, I thank you for watching this webinar. If you have any questions or feedback for me, feel free to email me at Hello@firststepaccounting.com. Or I play all over the Internet. You can find me on Instagram at First Step Accounting or on Twitter. Nayo Carter Gray.. Thanks and have an awesome day.\

[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm really excited to have Scrives here, Paul. He goes by Scrives, I feel like everywhere. A blog simple framework who's going to be sharing a whole new side of blogging. First of all, thank you so much for being here and for being part of this. I really appreciate it.\
\
[00:00:15.390] - Paul Scrivens\
Such a pleasure.\
\
[00:00:16.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
To be here. For the people that may not know you, which I find that hard to believe because I feel like you're everywhere-.\
\
[00:00:21.780] - Paul Scrivens\
Oh, you need to stop. You need.\
\
[00:00:23.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
To stop. Can you give people just a little on your background and what you're going to cover today?\
\
[00:00:30.170] - Paul Scrivens\
Well, I actually started blogging in 2003. And that was before people... I don't know if they even called it blogging back then or all that stuff. But essentially what happened was I graduated college. I didn't know what to do. So I got a really crappy job. And in this crappy job, I was supposed to be on the phone all the time and I don't like calling people. I'm just paranoid about it, even though that's surprising to a lot of people. And so my boss was like, Oh, we need a website. And I was like, Oh, I build websites all the time. I could build a website. I never built a website. So I didn't know what I was doing. But that was my story. And so I was like, Man, I really got to learn quickly how to build a website. So I was doing searches and actually came across some web design blogs and they were talking about how they did things. I was like, Oh, that's very interesting. And let me practice by setting up a blog. And so I set up a blog and actually started talking about web design. And that's how I was learning web design by sharing what I was learning at the same time with people.\
\
[00:01:27.670] - Paul Scrivens\
And long story short, boss found out about it, got upset, said that's not what I'm supposed to be doing, said I could either give up the blog or quit the job. So I quit the job. And then I became a full-time blogger. And I was really terrible at it for the longest time. Then I had to get a job again. And a couple of years ago, I came back into blogging. And I sat down and I tried to understand, okay, now why do some people succeed with blogging.\
\
[00:01:51.060] - Paul Scrivens\
And why do.\
\
[00:01:51.960] - Paul Scrivens\
Others just struggle? And I just kept on studying different people. And I just kept on always think it's like a coach. I just kept on trying to crack the code. And then I just kept on starting more and more blogs. And once you find what you're supposed to do, it just becomes a sick addiction. And so it's like my shoe collection behind me, it's like, I wish I could have blogs on the shelves over there and everything. So now what I do is I do have still have some other personal blogs and separate blogs, but I also help people that are just really trying to understand how do you figure out this whole blogging game and make it work for you. Yeah.\
\
[00:02:36.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So I'm excited to hear what you have said. Do you want to give us just some quick highlights of what you're going to teach us?\
\
[00:02:42.470] - Paul Scrivens\
Yeah. So I think the way blogging is moving into the future is that if everybody's focused on SEO or everybody's focused on Pinterest, there's just so many people who have already started blogging or generated a blog and everybody's just like, Oh, you got to do Pinterest and you got to do SEO. And so you just have everybody competing. And I think sometimes we think that we're trying to grow our blogs in a bubble, but we're actually competing with hundreds or thousands of other bloggers that are taking the same courses, doing the same tactics and everything. So how do you create a blog that is future proof, that is not reliant on third-party services, Google, Pinterest, or something else that's not reliant on algorithms? How do you build a blog that actually focuses on building a brand that allows you to build a tribe and that tribe sticks with you for as long as you want to keep the blog open. So how do you make your blog an actual business versus just a blog where you wake up every day praying to the Google or Pinterest gods, hoping to get.\
\
[00:03:40.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Some traffic. I know that's all marketing, right? So maybe you're starting there to attract your tribe, but how do you build something that your tribe is there no matter what?\
\
[00:03:49.140] - Paul Scrivens\
Right. So yeah, in essence, it's easy to get noticed, but how do you keep people's attention? And that's what we're going to be focusing on.\
\
[00:03:59.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right. I'm excited to do that. I'm going to let you take over and let's.\
\
[00:04:03.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Get to it.\
\
[00:04:03.890] - Paul Scrivens\
Awesome. Thank you.\
\
[00:04:05.670] - Paul Scrivens\
All right. We're ready to dive into this. Let's talk about building a better base camp. And if you don't know what a base camp is, this is essentially what a base camp is at the bottom of a mountain and everybody sets up base camp and that's just where they begin their journey. But essentially, base camp is where you always come back home. That's the idea that I'm working with here. That's the analogy that I'm going with. Hopefully you can work with me on that if you can. Okay. Well, I don't know what to say because I just like the title, Building a Better Base Camp. Let's run with that. First and foremost, I think we need to ask an important question. What is a blog? The funny thing is I could probably ask 99 bloggers that answered to this question and I would get 178 different answers and two people would say, Hold on, let me do some SEO research on that. The reality of it is blogging is home. It's the home for your business. It's the home for your ideas. It's the home for pretty much your own creation. And I want you to keep that in mind because a lot of people tend to treat their blog as a hobby.\
\
[00:05:20.210] - Paul Scrivens\
They treat it as just a part of their website. They treat it as basically something that they can get around to every once in a while. But when you think of it as your home, it becomes different because your home should always be presentable. Your home should always feel like home. It should just always be that place that people love to come back to. Again, I want you to keep that in mind. That's going to be very, very important here. Don't worry, I'm not going to quiz you on this. Now, I want you to imagine a world without ads. I know that sounds crazy because a lot of bloggers make good money with ads. However, when I like to think about the future of blogging or how somebody can set themselves up for success with their blog, I like to think about a world without ads. And the reason why is because the ad model is already known. We already know how to make money with ads. You create a blog, you create content, and then you get a lot, a lot of traffic to it. Because you need a lot, a lot of traffic, there's just so many different dependents, so many different variables you're depending on, right?\
\
[00:06:32.750] - Paul Scrivens\
If you like to use Pinterest and you're hoping that Pinterest smiles upon you and sends you a viral pin that day. If you're working on SEO, then you're hoping that you do better than all of your competition. Essentially, when you're working with ads, you're working with a lot of things that are out of your control. So what would you do if ads did not exist at all? I think that's a good question because when you think of it like that, I think for a lot of people, it changes their strategy with regards to how they approach their blog. Now, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have ads on your site. If you want to make money with ads, then by all means, make money with ads. But don't base your strategy around ads because what happens is if, let's say, you're ranking on the first page of Google and for this one post and this one post is basically making up 90 % of your revenue, what happens if Google changes their algorithm and that first post drops from the first position to the fifth position? It might not seem like much, but that could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of page views.\
\
[00:07:40.060] - Paul Scrivens\
That just completely crashes your revenue. What do you do? Another thing just to keep in mind, that's the whole reason why we're going through all this, is we're just imagining a world without ads. But I don't want you to think that everything that you do and learn moving forward means you can't have ads on your site. All right, makes sense. All right, so this is probably the most important question. What is the purpose of business? I know there's going to be a lot of people saying, I already know the purpose of business. The purpose of business is to help people and just do wonderful things for the world. Again, that's not the purpose of business. The purpose of business is to make money. Let's just get right to it. The purpose of business is to make money. If you're starting a blog, chances are you're starting a blog to make money. That doesn't mean that you're not doing it to help people or gain some type of fulfillment or change the world for the better, but you want to make money, and that's the purpose of business. I don't want you to be scared about saying, You know what?\
\
[00:08:45.970] - Paul Scrivens\
I'm doing this to make money. Because what happens when you make money? The more money you make, the more people you can help. And so if you're one of those people that says, I really want to change the world with my blood. I really want to help people. Well, guess what? When you make more money, you get to help more people. I mean, look at that guy. That guy is smiling because he knows he just made a deal that's going to make them more money. That's a good deal. So after you ask that question, which I just answered for you, you need to ask another question. What is the best way to make money? Now, I can tell you one of the best ways not to make money, and that's to pretend you're a happy homeless person like this guy in the picture. That is not one of the best ways to make money. So don't do that. We're more specifically wondering what's the best way to make money with your blog? And this is where people get caught up in tactics. They think, Oh, maybe ads or affiliate marketing or products or services. That's not really it.\
\
[00:09:39.920] - Paul Scrivens\
You need to think more about the strategy and not necessarily the tactics. So what is the best way to make money? Well, first and foremost, you need to send the right message and we'll go deeper into the right message. And then you need to send it to the right person. If you have a fear of clowns, I'm sorry, there was much scarier clown pictures that I could have used and this was the happy one. So again, sorry to throw that off. The right message to the right person with the right offer, that is the best way for you to make money. Because if you can send the right message to the right person with the right offer, you have a great chance of selling an affiliate product, selling your own product, selling a service. Why? Because that person's ready. It's very similar to, let's say, you're leaving a grocery store, and that's where all the Girl Scouts like to hang out and sell their cookies. It makes sense because you're shopping, you're in the mindset of food, getting ready to eat, and you bought your dinner, and there's these Girl Scouts offering you some cookies, and Thin Mints would go great with that meal you're going to prepare.\
\
[00:10:44.340] - Paul Scrivens\
So why not? But what if somebody was trying to sell you tires when you leave the grocery store? They probably wouldn't sell many tires because most people are thinking about getting tires when they're leaving the grocery store. Now, however, if there was somebody that has a flat tire in the grocery store parking lot and decide to go in and get a sandwich and is coming back out and you're selling tires, then that would be the perfect person to sell to. But the chances of that happening are slim. So you really don't want to go down that road. So again, the right message to the right person with the right offer is the best way to make money. And if we're being honest, this is where most blogs collapse. And I say that because we're not necessarily taught as bloggers how we should approach our whole blog strategy. A lot of us are taught that we should just go and just find all the popular content or the best content that people want to read and then we just write that content. And so each individual piece of content just does its own thing. And eventually what happens after a couple of months or a couple of years, we have this blog that is just a paint splatter of a bunch of different topics and blog posts.\
\
[00:12:01.270] - Paul Scrivens\
There's just no cohesion to it. And the reality of it is every piece of content that you create must have a purpose. It must have a purpose. So basically every single thing that you do with regards to content creation, be it blog post, YouTube videos, social media posts, it all has to have a purpose. And so if you're wondering, well, what is that purpose? That's an excellent question, and that's why you're my favorite student. No matter how many people watching this, you're my favorite student. Just keep that in mind. So what is the purpose? Well, before we can understand the purpose of each piece of content, we need to start with a goal. You might be thinking, Well, the goal is to make money because that's what you said. The goal is to make money with the business. And you caught me on that one. But unfortunately, that is not the goal we're thinking of. We're not thinking of the goal for you. We're thinking of the goal for your reader. And this is important because without the reader, if we're being honest, there is no money. And I'm sure you figured that out, right?\
\
[00:13:13.240] - Paul Scrivens\
There's no audience, there is no money. So we need to figure out a goal for the reader. Because if you can figure out a goal for the reader, then everything else starts to fall in place. So how do you figure that out? You're going to ask a simple question. Who do they want to become? Now you might be thinking, Well, wait, that's not really simple at all. What do you mean, who do they want to become? Well, if you think about it, whenever we do a search on Google or YouTube or Pinterest, we're searching for maybe a solution. If we're going through social media and we're liking posts, then maybe we're liking posts because we aspire for something. No matter what, we want to become something. We want to become someone else than who we currently are. I don't want you to think extreme. I don't think suddenly that I wish I was a member of parliament in England. It's not like that. But a simple example would be when you're hungry, you want to become someone who's not hungry. It's small things like that. When your teeth feel yucky, you want to be someone who feels like their teeth aren't yucky, so you go brush your teeth.\
\
[00:14:27.510] - Paul Scrivens\
It could be very simple to think like things like that. It could be very complex things. It could be someone who wants to become someone that's going to have your marriage that has a better job. It can be very small things or can be very large things. But you need to figure out who does your reader want to become. You have to be careful here because this is where a lot of people get caught up and they come up with very vague things. My reader wants a happier life. The more specific you can get, the better. For example, let's say someone wants to gain a bigger audience with something. Let's say a person wants to gain a bigger audience for their blog, they want to be someone who has a larger following for their blog. They realize that maybe YouTube is a good place to go. That can be a thing. They want to be a person who has a thousand subscribers on YouTube. Okay, so that's very specific, right? That's very specific and something we can figure out. So after you figure out who they want to become, you need to figure out the steps.\
\
[00:15:30.610] - Paul Scrivens\
And what I mean is you need to map out all the different things that someone must know to achieve that person they want to become. And this is going to be totally dependent on the size of the goal. If the goal is massive, like I want to be an astronaut, then obviously you're going to have a ridiculous amount of steps. But if the goal is you just don't want your teeth to feel yucky anymore, then maybe the steps are go buy some toothpaste and toothbrush, go home, brush your teeth. Even then, we can break that down. What's the best toothpaste? What's the best toothbrush? What's the best technique for brushing your teeth? Let me show you how to brush your teeth. Should you floss? Almost anything that we can come up with with regards to the goal, we can break it down into steps. As you'll see in a little bit, I don't want to spoil this for you, but as we'll see in a little bit, each of those steps can become a piece of content. Now hopefully you're starting to see the structure that you're forming with your blog. Instead of just having a blog with random blog posts all over the place, you're starting to have a little bit of structure here.\
\
[00:16:40.270] - Paul Scrivens\
Now that you understand the steps, and you might not have all the steps written down, you might not understand all the things that a person immediately needs to do to become this new person that they want to become. But over time, you'll begin to figure it out, either through interactions with people, through comments, through emails. This is something that is not supposed to be where you figure out the steps and then that's it. You figure out the steps that you know right now and then maybe you figure out some more steps six months later. So now what? Now what do you do? Do you create tons of content? It's very possible. That's what a lot of bloggers tend to do, right? They just say, Hey, it's time for me to create a ton of content and I am going to write 100 blog posts in the next three months. And that's what I'm going to do. I'll just start creating content. Before you do that, you need to become aware of something. What is it that you need to become aware of? Well, you need to become aware of the five stages of awareness. I know you're wondering, What are you talking about?\
\
[00:17:47.800] - Paul Scrivens\
What are these five stages of awareness? Well, if we go all the way back in time, we answer the question, What is the best way to make money? The best way to make money is to send the right message to the right person with the right offer. However, people aren't always ready for that offer. Let me brought up the grocery store analogy, but we have another analogy that we're working with now, and that is the person wants 1,000 subscribers on YouTube. Now, that goal was very specific in the sense that this person knew that they wanted 1,000 subscribers. What about the person that just is thinking about growing their blog? They're not they're not even... They don't really know YouTube is an option for them growing their blog. They're at a different stage of awareness, right? There's a person who totally understands that YouTube can help them and they want to dive deeper into it, and then there's a person who doesn't even know YouTube is an option for them. That's what we're talking about with the five stages of awareness. You have most aware, which is the person who just knows, Okay, I know YouTube is going to help me.\
\
[00:18:55.340] - Paul Scrivens\
I've got my channel set up. I know all this stuff. I need to figure out how to get my first out on the subscribers. It goes all the way down to the completely unaware person who doesn't even know YouTube is an option. There's a difference. Then you have all these stages in the middle. You have product aware where they understand that there is a product out there that will help them and they're actually looking at the product. You have solution aware where they understand it's a solution. They just don't know which solution to pick. Problem Aware is when they realize, Oh, okay, I actually do have a problem that I want to fix. So if we're looking at this with a YouTube person, getting completely unaware, they don't really know YouTube is an option. Problem Aware is, Oh, now they know YouTube is an option, but they don't know what they're supposed to do with YouTube. Solution Aware is, Oh, now they see that there is possibility to grow to a thousand subscribers and get big, product-aware would be maybe they now find a course or both teaching them how to get to a thousand subscribers.\
\
[00:19:55.010] - Paul Scrivens\
Most aware is now they're completely aware of the product, the solutions, and all of the problems, and they're ready to make a decision and move forward with stuff. So what does this have to do with content? Well, believe it or not, every piece of content you create is directed towards a stage of awareness. Whether you knew a stage of awareness was being targeted by a piece of content or not, it doesn't matter. Every piece of content that you create is directed towards a stage of awareness. And this is where when you understand this concept as a blogger, the game completely changes. The reason why it changes because when you understand the content, when you understand who that content is specifically targeting, you understand the map. The map is the way you get back to your base camp. What exactly do I mean by this? Well, let's look at some examples here. We're sticking with this getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube thing. Let's say you decide I'm going to write a post. The ultimate guide to getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. I love ultimate guides. Ultimately guides are a great start for anything.\
\
[00:21:06.020] - Paul Scrivens\
Now, a lot of people, what they would do is they would just leave it at that. I've created the ultimate guide to getting your first subscribers on YouTube. So that's it. I don't need to do anything else. However, remember the person who doesn't even know that YouTube is a solution for them. They're scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, whatever, and they see the ultimate guide to getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. And what do they do? They just go right past it. Why? Because they're not even aware that YouTube is an option for them. What could I do for that person? Looking through this content, I don't have a specific post for that person. A post for that person could be 17 ways to grow your blog's audience. Now, that person knows that they want to grow their blog audience. As they're going through that post, you see number 13, use YouTube. Now they're becoming aware. Wow. I can actually use YouTube to help grow my blog audience. Okay. This is starting to make sense here. Starting to make sense. I'm starting to piece things together here. But we also have other pieces of content that go towards the different stages.\
\
[00:22:23.070] - Paul Scrivens\
The idea here is when we say, when you understand the content, you understand the map, think if you can attach a stage of awareness to each of these pieces of content. And the idea is you want to move them from five to one, right? You want to move them up the ladder, so to speak. If you could attach a stage of awareness to each of these pieces of content, then you can start building out a map or a guide. You can figure out which post is a link to where. Instead of just randomly saying, Well, you know what? I want to rank for this keyword, so I'm going to have this post linked to this other post. Instead, you can say, You know what? Now that this person has read my 17 ways to build your blog's audience and now they're interested in YouTube, now maybe I can send them to the ultimate guide to get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. And that post suddenly links to the top five cameras for people getting started with YouTube, which then links to my YouTube channel on creating a video, creating your first video for YouTube.\
\
[00:23:27.360] - Paul Scrivens\
And then when you create your first video, you want to edit it. So then that links to my post on the best software to use to edit your videos. And while you're editing your videos, you want to add music, so you need to find the best places for copyright-free music. And now that you've done your first video, you want to figure out some other video ideas, so then that links to a post on creating video ideas. Now that you have your basic setup, maybe you want to see a more advanced setup. I'll talk about it on my Instagram story about my own video setup. Now you're getting sick of me talking about my stuff and you want to learn from somebody else. Then I have a Facebook Live interview with another YouTube creator where she explains how she got started with YouTube, which those posts, which that Facebook Live can link back to my site with some other posts. Then I decided, Hey, you know what? I want to send out a series of tweets with all short tips on succeeding with YouTube and all those tips linked back to the different posts that I've created on my site because now I have a map and this map is leading them all the way up to the stages of awareness.\
\
[00:24:27.040] - Paul Scrivens\
Now, notice if you're looking at this list, this is not just posts on your site. It's actually social media posts, your own posts on your site, and everything just leads back to that single goal. And again, the goal we set up for this person is how to get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. Now, the beauty of following this method, which I call the content buffet, is that over time you're going to have multiple goals. But first you just need to start with the what. You need to start with that one goal. What do you want your reader to become? I want my reader to become someone who can get their first thousand subscribers on YouTube. Now, once they do that, what do I want them to do? Maybe I say I want them to make their first thousand dollars from affiliate marketing in YouTube. So then that becomes a whole new set of posts and social media and all that stuff. And then from there, what do I want them to do? Well, then I want them to get to a million subscribers. And you might be wondering, where emails or products or services fit in here?\
\
[00:25:36.280] - Paul Scrivens\
Hopefully you can see this all comes together. Because it's not that I have to say these things once, I'm going to say these things over and over again. I can have an email series that also talks about fighting copyright-free music and then making sure that you understand the best type of music to use for your video. I can have a whole course on setting up your YouTube channel and using YouTube SEO to rank better with your videos. And this is all going to work. Why? Because I understand now that I have to send the right message to the right person with the right offer. It's not just me creating random content for my site, hoping that each individual piece of content gets X amount of traffic, so I can make a little bit of money. Every piece of content that I've created here serves a purpose, and maybe business-wise, that purpose is leading them to my YouTube course. But it doesn't make sense for me to write the blog post on the 14 ways to grow your blog's audience. And in that post, I say, You know what? You can use YouTube to grow your audience.\
\
[00:26:51.880] - Paul Scrivens\
If you want to use YouTube, go buy my course. Because that person had just entered the fourth stage. They just became problem aware. They're not at product aware or most aware. And so that's why I want to link them to my other pieces of content. That's why no matter where they come across me, either on the blog, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, whatever channels I decide to use, everything is just driving home that message. Hey, I'm going to help you get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. I'm going to help you build a successful YouTube channel. Everything comes back to your base camp. That's why I like to call the blog the base camp. When I said your blog is your home, think about it. When people into your home and they go, Where's the bathroom? Most homes follow a logical layout, right? You don't go, Where's the bathroom? Oh, it's in the basement. Just go down the hall, take a left. Okay. That's how you need to set up your site. How can you set up your site where the map becomes clear? Instead of your homepage just being a big generic screen with a list of blog post, maybe it becomes a map of its own.\
\
[00:28:18.110] - Paul Scrivens\
Maybe you tell the people, Hey, you want to build a successful YouTube channel? Follow these lists of posts in order. And so the content buffet, people should be able to go to your site, jump in and out, pull the pieces of content that they want at that time. But it all follows the same theme. Sometimes you go to the buffet, you might say, You know what? Let me get some chicken wings this time. Well, guess what? I have a nice little email series on something with YouTube. They go sit down and they consume that. They're like, All right, I'm ready for some more. Oh, guess what? The Prime rib is ready. So you go to get the Prime rib. Prime rib happens to be a nice big blog post on something else with YouTube. When you follow this model with your blog, it gives your blog more structure. So there are benefits to this. There are huge benefits when you follow this model because now your blog has a structure, it gives you authority. Because if somebody comes to your site and they're like, Holy crap, this blog has all the information I need about this one person that I want to become, you build authority.\
\
[00:29:40.350] - Paul Scrivens\
And when you build authority, you build trust. Because you have that trust and it makes it easier to get people to buy things. It also builds expertise. You become known. People say, Oh, you're interested in building a YouTube channel, getting your first down subscribers? Go check out Paul. There's a whole site around that stuff. Now, you might be concerned like, Oh, I really don't want a niche site. I don't want my site to be one particular thing. Remember, you could expand. But you need to start with one thing. You need to start with one goal because you're going to find that you have that one goal. It becomes a lot easier to map everything else. Now, you might be asking a question. This question might be just ringing in your ears. The question is, But what about my ads? You said I didn't have to get rid of my ads. Notice that I didn't take away ads from this. You can still write your 99 ketogenic dinners made with chocolate, right? You can still write posts like that that have a chance of pulling in big stuff. You can still write the post that target specific SEO keywords.\
\
[00:30:54.560] - Paul Scrivens\
This model is not taking anything away from that. What it's doing is it's giving the overall blog a structure. It's making sure that each piece of content plays a specific role and makes sure that everything is cohesive. The actual steps, what do you need to do? You need to figure out the goal. Now, again, over time, you're going to have multiple goals as your blog expands. Or maybe you just have the one goal and it takes you for 5, 10 years to write everything to accomplish that one goal, or you just keep on expanding that goal. You need to map out the steps. This is also a great way to figure out your content. I know a lot of bloggers sit there and I just don't know what to write about. Well, figure out the goal, map out the steps, and then that's the content that you need to create. And then you need to make sure that each piece of content that you do create has a job. And what I mean by this is every piece of content should have a call to action. And that doesn't necessarily mean that every piece of content needs to get the reader to sign up for it, that's your mailing list, right?\
\
[00:32:01.040] - Paul Scrivens\
Because what if somebody's completely unaware? Do they want to sign up for your email course on how to pick the perfect in credit post titles card for a YouTube video? Probably not because they don't know what that means. So maybe your big call to action is licking them to another post, which will move them up the content awareness ladder. And then in that post, maybe you have a very specific opt-in that works for their level of awareness. When you understand the levels of awareness for each piece of content, you can tailor more specific calls to action, which increases the conversion rate of those calls to action, which gets you the right people. And when you have the right people, you already know you're sending them the right message. And when you're sending them the right message, you can send them to the right offer. And now you're making more money with your blog. Now you're getting more traffic with your blog. Now your blog is becoming more known. Everything just works out better. When you start following this content buffet and you're creating and building a better base camp. There's a lot to digest with all this.\
\
[00:33:10.950] - Paul Scrivens\
There's a whole lot you can run with on this and it's just an exciting way to go about blogging because it feels like it gives your blog a purpose. It feels like when somebody shows up for your blog, they're not just showing up and randomly wondering, What do I do now? Your blog gives them all the tools that they need. That's just a good feeling to have. All right, thank you. That's not a stock photo, that's actually me. The clown picture was better, but I like that one. Thank you, everybody. Hopefully, I didn't put you to sleep. And yeah, if you ever have any questions, just reach out.\
\
[00:33:55.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Thank you so much for sharing all that valuable information. I love the aspect of not just getting attention, but getting people to stay there. So thank you for sharing that. Any final words before we tell everyone about the free thing you've got for them?\
\
[00:34:12.700] - Paul Scrivens\
I know blogging can be frustrating, depending on who you're looking at, because it always seems like there's one person who's like, I'm doing so great with my blog today. And then you're sitting there thinking, That's not fair. My blog is not doing well at all. But for every one person, there's thousands of us who are still going through that struggle. And really, the name of the game is just persistence. And I don't mean persistence like you keep on banging your head against the wall. But every once in a while, take a step back, look, see what adjustments you can make, test things, and keep on pushing.\
\
[00:34:43.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And I'm sure after the summit, you'll have a ton of ideas. So take a deep breath, maybe write them all out. And then just write.\
\
[00:34:50.700] - Paul Scrivens\
Them all down.\
\
[00:34:51.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Most definitely. Exactly. I really am doing all the sessions. I have so many ideas. But yeah. Okay. So I know you got a great Free offer for all the attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:35:02.510] - Paul Scrivens\
Yeah. So this is a free masterclass that is going to extend.\
\
[00:35:07.710] - Paul Scrivens\
Further on.\
\
[00:35:08.710] - Paul Scrivens\
The talk that we just went through. And when I do masterclasses, it's not a Slideshow. So this is going to be pretty interactive, and you get to see a lot of behind the scenes of what I would do if I was starting a blog completely from scratch.\
\
[00:35:23.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So, guys, the link for that is just below. Go grab it, go sign up, check it out. Especially, obviously, you can see how well he knows his stuff from.\
\
[00:35:34.050] - Paul Scrivens\
This session. I'm telling you, you see the size of my head. You can't keep making my head grow bigger. I'm going to have to buy a new set of headphones here.\
\
[00:35:41.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But yeah, so definitely go check that out. Again, thank you so much for being part of this.\
\
[00:35:45.270] - Paul Scrivens\
I really appreciate it. It was fun. I had a blast. Thank you.\

[00:00:12.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm really excited to have this speaker back. I've been talking to her a lot lately. I'm so excited when I saw her on my calendar today. She's the founder and CEO of the Simple Business School, Membership, and Simple Business Suite. Customized all-in-one software for online business owners. She's a business coach and consultant who helps online business owners run simple, streamlined and in profitable businesses in less than 20 hours a week. She's been in business for nine years and has helped thousands of people start and scale their own business to reach their unique freedom goals. A big warm welcome back to Steph. Steph, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:00:43.200] - Steph Blake\
Liz, of course. I'm so glad to be here. I always love talking with you. Thanks for having me.\
\
[00:00:47.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's always a really good time. We're going to be talking about Simplicity and streamlining your business. Why don't we start by, how do you define a simple and streamlined business?\
\
[00:00:58.610] - Steph Blake\
When I think of It's a simple and streamlined business. It is a business that essentially works for you, not you working for it. A lot of times people, especially when they're either getting started in business or they've been in business for a while, they just start to do so many things. Things get very overwhelming, very, very quickly. Once they start to even think about scaling, it's not possible for a lot of people because they just have too much happening, too much going on.\
\
[00:01:30.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, I'm guilty. Okay, so when you say it's working for you, are we talking automations? Are we talking about it's instead of seven different things going on, you're really pairing down to one or two? What's the dirty detail there?\
\
[00:01:47.980] - Steph Blake\
Yeah, so when I talk simplicity, specifically, especially for people who are in the more beginning stages, I always say, Focus on one thing. Focus on selling one thing and reach your your time freedom goals and your money freedom goals. For most people I work with, they want to reach six figures and they want to work less than 20 hours a week. Have one business, or I'm sorry, sell one thing until you reach that goal. Now, once you reach that goal, whatever that goal is for you. Maybe some people just want... Some people want to make $50,000 and they want to work 40 hours a week, whatever it is. Everybody's situation is unique. So once you reach that goal, then if you have this desire to do more, to pursue another passion, then you can add other things onto it. But we want to make sure that you have everything set up and streamlined so you're not getting overwhelmed when you add these other pieces on. So yes, automation is a really big part of it because if you don't have to do something, let the robots do it for you. But it also comes down to organization, too, on the back end of your business.\
\
[00:02:53.840] - Steph Blake\
Because you're going to notice after you set one side of your business up, let's say you do, I don't know, consulting, and you work with people in either a group setting or a one-on-one setting, then you can take a lot of those systems and those processes and you can duplicate them for another offer that you create, or maybe you want to start another business or whatever it is. Really focusing, again, on simplifying by selling one thing and streamlining by setting up all of those back-end processes. That is going to, again, not only allow you to reach your goals initially, but then allow you to scale because you all the pieces in place for this current offer and the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one.\
\
[00:03:35.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Let's talk about those pieces because I feel like you think, Oh, I just need... When you first think of it, it seems so simple, but then you actually get into it, it's like 17 tiny steps into that one thing. What are some processes that you see people underestimating in terms of set up and automating or stuff that's under automated? What are some of areas that people should really focus on, honing in on?\
\
[00:04:04.570] - Steph Blake\
The biggest thing that I see, especially for people in service-based businesses, is their onboarding. Their onboarding and their offboarding. Far too much of that is done manually, and a lot of people are afraid to automate pieces of that because they're afraid that an email will get accidentally sent or something will go out to the wrong person, and they want to make sure that their client, especially their new client, has It's a really great experience. That's one big thing. Another big thing is, and I know that the people who are listening to this, they don't necessarily have clients because they do a lot of blogging and whatnot. But another big piece that I see people not doing is organizing with digital tools. I know you love ClickUp, I love ClickUp, and a lot of people shy away from that because they think they have to be really tech-savvy. But truthfully, you don't. You can set it up to be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. The biggest thing here is to just use a tool that works for you because, again, that will allow you to simplify things, automate tasks. I love automating tasks, recurring tasks.\
\
[00:05:17.880] - Steph Blake\
There's so many different pieces of it. Does that answer your question?\
\
[00:05:20.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, no. I think, especially where you're talking about the example of they're nervous to automate because they don't want an email going out. Well, at least automate to the extent that it's a click of a button to send it when you I want it to. Don't be having to manually write that email every single time or draft that proposal or whatever.\
\
[00:05:38.240] - Steph Blake\
Templates, canned emails.\
\
[00:05:41.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. There's so many tools, guys. You could do templates and so many things. I love you could do templates. I do email templates inClickUp.\
\
[00:05:53.290] - Steph Blake\
There's so many different- I love Airtable. Yeah.\
\
[00:05:58.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So yeah, There's... Never underestimate how much time a template or just a text expanding tool will save you.\
\
[00:06:09.050] - Steph Blake\
Yeah. And I think another piece of that is people think that they don't have to document their processes, too, because they're like, Oh, I'll remember. I've done this so many times. But guess what? If you have kids and you're in the middle of doing something and your kid starts throwing up, but you haven't documented your process, then you come back and you're like, Oh, shoot. Did I do that? Did I do that piece? So it's all of this extra brain work.\
\
[00:06:33.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's also going to get to the point in your business, if you're growing, that you probably won't be doing that particular task as often, either because you automate it or you bring on help. I only run this summit once a year. Okay, well, I'm not actually doing the whole transcript processing for a summit session in April. It's once a year. What did I do last year that worked really well? I write it down because otherwise, I know But then it's having to work that much harder to figure it out.\
\
[00:07:04.760] - Steph Blake\
And that is one of those things that uses up all of your time, right?\
\
[00:07:08.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And if you get into batching, which hopefully everyone does because it's a huge time saver, again, you're not doing that task every day. You're doing it once a month, once every other month. You don't want to have to use that brainpower just document.\
\
[00:07:22.030] - Steph Blake\
Yeah, absolutely. And if you're somebody like me with ADHD and you get 30 new ideas a day, guess what? You're not going to be able to remember all of those things because we are still human at the end of the day. I need lists for everything, honestly.\
\
[00:07:39.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay, let's talk about that a little bit more because, of course, when you scale, it typically brings more tasks, more responsibilities. Lists is just one method, I think, that helps people keep things simple and avoid overwhelm. What are some other ways you've noticed with your clients, especially that they manage that?\
\
[00:07:56.700] - Steph Blake\
Like I said before, having a place where you keep all of your tasks. A project management tool is non-negotiable. Non-negotiable, even if you are a solopreneur right now. I started using ClickUp when I was still in my corporate job and a solopreneur, just because, well, one, I just love to organize things. But two, I knew that eventually I needed a platform that was going to grow with me because now I have team members. And guess what? Those team members need access to these things. And it doesn't make sense for me to shoot somebody a text message to ask them to create a graphic in Canva. It's little things like that. Treating your business like an actual business is what it boils down to. When you think of any business out there, I don't know, let's look at... I don't know, Target. Target, for example. Do you think Target has processes for new team members joining? Do you think they have a process for, I don't know, stocking their shelves? Do you think they have a process for even your lunch break? There are documented process for how all of these things work. So it doesn't matter if you're just getting started or your Target or Amazon or a huge giant.\
\
[00:09:06.010] - Steph Blake\
You need these different pieces in place to eventually be a truly successful company.\
\
[00:09:11.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And I will say one thing about ClickUp is that you also have a personal list of like, Oh, yeah, I need to go in the litter box today. It's trash takeout day. So I'm not trying to look at ClickUp in my personal calendar. In my business, it's all just in one place.\
\
[00:09:27.740] - Steph Blake\
My gosh, my personal list in ClickUp is a big repository of random ideas that come to my head, too.\
\
[00:09:35.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Mine is just the recurring little chores that I need to not let get bad.\
\
[00:09:40.890] - Steph Blake\
Yeah. I have a whole other space for my personal life. So again, that's why it's great. You can organize your personal life, you can organize your business life, and you can keep it all in place. So you don't have to go to a bunch of different tools. That's another thing, is simplifying the tools. So many people are\
\
[00:10:00.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Especially, from a recovering to appsumo addict?\
\
[00:10:02.860] - Steph Blake\
Same.\
\
[00:10:05.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
When people are getting to the point where maybe they're scaling because they've got these foundational pieces in place, what are some of the first tasks or roles that you suggest they consider outsourcing or delegating?\
\
[00:10:19.120] - Steph Blake\
Yeah. Well, I mean, at this point, you should be outsourcing anything financial because you should not be doing that. If you're at the point of scaling, you should outsource your bookkeeping, you should outsource your accounting. All of that should already be outsourced at this point. That is not something that you need to worry about. Then if you haven't brought on somebody to do admin work in your business, things like answering support emails, making sure people get access to things. For example, if you're creating courses and people can't get access to it, you need somebody to come in and do those little pieces or somebody to come in and create graphics. It's hard to say, honestly, because it's so unique to each business and what each business needs. For example, I have a membership and I have a software company. I have team members devoted to both things because the tasks are very different and they require very unique sets of skills. I also run bundles, and I have one person that manages all of our bundles. I can't just say, Okay, I need one person to do all of these different things. It's so unique to each individual business.\
\
[00:11:29.350] - Steph Blake\
I would say Okay, look at your big goal. I would say for the year, honestly, think about what it's going to take to reach that goal and then hire people to fill those roles before you get there. Because if that is going to allow you, having people in those roles will allow you to reach that so much more quickly than if you try to just do it on your own because you're just going to be at the same place year after year after year, wondering why you're not hitting that goal when you are one person and you can only do so much.\
\
[00:11:59.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely. Okay, so when you are deciding to automate, and there's obviously so many different tools out there that help you automate, how do you decide what to automate and what you should keep hands on? Is there something that you're like, This is always going to be hands-on for me?\
\
[00:12:15.130] - Steph Blake\
Yeah. So the things that I like to keep hands on are things where I know it requires a personal touch for me. So for example, the bundles are a good example. So I host bundles once a quarter, at least at the time of recording this. We may be doing more. But when Whenever those emails go out to our contributors, I like to write those because I'll do a daily recap of everything. So that is not something that can be automated because I need to take time to review the things that happened the day before, put all the stats in, add my personal touch. I would say anything that requires a personalized touch from you should not be automated. Now, things like your welcome sequence, obviously, that should be automated. You do not need to be sending that out. Things like booking calls with you, that should be automated. When it comes to... I don't know, I'm trying to come up with some examples off the top of my head right now. Really, anything that requires a personal touch from you should not be automated. Anything else can be automated. You'll see very quickly that 95% of things in your business do not require a personal touch from you.\
\
[00:13:23.640] - Steph Blake\
They don't.\
\
[00:13:25.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I like that. Yeah, once you've created it, that was your personal touch. You don't need to continue.\
\
[00:13:35.560] - Steph Blake\
Create it one time, leave it.\
\
[00:13:39.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
When it comes to measuring the success of everything, what metrics do you think are essential for tracking growth and efficiency without overcomplicating the process?\
\
[00:13:52.310] - Steph Blake\
I'm going to be honest with you. Numbers are not my favorite thing. They are very hard for my brain to understand. They always have been. I I don't know why. But I have come to learn over the years that it is so crucial, especially as you're scaling, because you have to see what's working, you have to see what's not working. I like to track, obviously, on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis. I always like to go back and refer to the data from that previous time period. For example, when we host a bundle, I'll keep track of all of the stats, and then I'll go back and reference the previous bundle to see, Okay, how did this perform compared to that? That could be anything like sales for the day, overall sales, clicks for the page, abandoned checkouts, What else? Clicks on emails. So again, that's something that's very specific to the... If you're launching something, it's going to be very specific to that. On an ongoing basis, though, bare minimum, everybody needs to be tracking your revenue, your total revenue, the total amount of cash, the amount of cash that you're keeping, the amount of cash that you're spending, your expenses on your team, your tools, all of that.\
\
[00:15:13.850] - Steph Blake\
And then I also, again, along the same lines of simplicity, tell people to focus on one free resource. One free resource aligned with that one free offer until you reach your goals. So you should constantly be tracking the data for that free resource. So How many clicks is it getting? What's your conversion rate? How many sales is that getting you? And just putting that out in tons of different areas. The other piece of that is the collaboration that you do. For example, for this event, I'm going to be tracking whether or not it brought me leads, whether or not it brought me clients. Spoiler alert, all of Liz's do. That's what I love participating in them. I know that was a big list, so I don't know. Was that helpful? Do you need me to clarify anything?\
\
[00:16:02.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I think that's great. I love numbers, actually, so I'm a little different than you. But I struggle to set... I don't want to have to go dig up the data every single time, but I struggle to set up and create a dashboard in data studio or something. I just, finally, hopefully set it up properly, a data overview of how Black Friday stuff is going for me. We'll see. But it is. We all have our little blocks and struggles What else with that?\
\
[00:16:31.230] - Steph Blake\
For all of our sales, I do have an Airtable database set up that does all of that for me on autopilot. So I just look and I say, Okay, how much should we make this month? All of that, like what were the best sellers? All of that, because I don't want to think about that.\
\
[00:16:44.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. Okay, final question. Looking back on your own journey, what are some things you would have done differently to scale more smoothly?\
\
[00:16:52.600] - Steph Blake\
My goodness. How long do you have?. Thank Okay, so really the biggest thing, and this is probably going to sound hilarious coming from me, but simplifying sooner. Because my first year in business, I had eight different businesses because I had undiagnosed ADHD, and I was just so excited about this new beautiful online world I found. So that is really one of the most important things I would do. And then also remember, and this is going to sound so cheesy, so cheesy, but it's true, to remember that It's you are on your own journey. You are not comparing yourself to anybody else because I got stuck in that trap for years, years, and years, and years of looking at people who I thought were on the same path as me. We started business together. This person was here. I was here. I was like, What's going on? Why are they surpassing me? I'm so much smarter. Blah, blah, blah, blah, all of these things, right? Not taking into account all of the other things in my life, not taking account their background, their experience, right? There's all these different things that we don't think about.\
\
[00:18:03.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:18:05.040] - Steph Blake\
you be you.\
\
[00:18:06.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. The other website is that. It's chase after your own version of success. Exactly. That's something that I got stuck doing more than once because if you don't learn your lesson the first time, life will make sure you get to learn the lesson again. You're like, Oh, I want that. And you go get it because you take that course and you get there and you're like, That's actually not what I want. So make sure you're taking a step back and evaluating what the business is like you want and then be on your own.\
\
[00:18:33.260] - Steph Blake\
Yeah, and literally build your business around the life that you want. That's the most important thing.\
\
[00:18:39.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, I like that. Okay, is there anything else you last minute, if you want to share with them before we talk about all the things they can get from you.\
\
[00:18:48.050] - Steph Blake\
I mean, I have so many different things to share, but like I said, my biggest piece of advice is just keep things really, really simple. And that just means reducing the number of things that you're selling until you reach your goals. That's really my biggest piece of advice, because the more simple that you can be, the more quickly that you will be able to scale.\
\
[00:19:09.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right. So why don't you go ahead and tell everyone what they can grab the link below? I'm pretty I think it's a pretty awesome offer.\
\
[00:19:17.230] - Steph Blake\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:10.020] - Sylvia Inks, smifinancialcoaching.com\
Hi, my name is Sylvia Inks and I'm the founder of SMI Financial Coaching. I'm so excited that you are here. I've worked with and seen many entrepreneurs who were great at what they do. They've got a great product. They've got a great service, but they're secretly struggling with the finances in their business. Today, I want to share with you the biggest financial mistakes to watch out for as an entrepreneur.\
\
[00:00:41.590] - Sylvia\
A few key things to keep in mind. Being great with your personal finances does not automatically mean that you were great with business finances. I've seen both new and experienced entrepreneurs make some or all of these mistakes. And I've also worked with six figure business owners who have made some of these mistakes. So, let's get started.\
\
[00:01:07.830] - Sylvia\
Here's a quick overview of what I will be covering. One introduction. Two common goals of small business owners versus the reality. Next, I'll do the seven financial mistakes. Then I'll do a recap, including a list of action items, if you find that you were making one or more of these mistakes and then I have a bonus for you if you stick with me until the end. So, let's get started.\
\
[00:01:37.360] - Sylvia\
So, who am I? Again, my name is Sylvia Inks. I am a coach for coaches, consultants and service based business owners and the author of the book "Small Business Finance for the Busy Entrepreneur". And I help entrepreneurs save and make more money by creating additional income streams in their business.\
\
[00:02:01.950] - Sylvia\
Three common goals that I see, almost all small business owners have, one, make money, otherwise it's called a hobby. To save time. And three, reduce stress. However, the reality is most small business owners are not making the money that they need or want in their business.\
\
[00:02:27.980] - Sylvia\
They're not saving time, they're actually working more hours than they ever expected. And they're not reducing stress, they're actually more stressed than ever before.\
\
[00:02:39.990] - Sylvia\
So, now let's dive into the seven biggest mistakes and how avoiding these mistakes will actually help you reach one or all three of these goals to make more money, save time and reduce stress.\
\
[00:02:56.150] - Sylvia\
Mistake number one, co-mingling your personal business money when you worked in corporate America, did you ever loan your boss or the company money? Assuming the answer is no, if you would never do that in your corporate job, then why are you doing that in your own small business? Remember that the business in you and your personal life, these should be kept separate. Now, if you've been making this mistake and you've been co-mingling your funds and if you are ever audited by the IRS, you could one day lose the legal protection on your business and to get fined and have to pay a penalty and interest fees if any of the expenses had been incorrectly flagged as a business expense but was actually a personal expense.\
\
[00:03:48.720] - Sylvia\
So, I'm actually going to share a couple realized stories with you. I had one six figure business owner tell me that she used the personal family checking account for her business when she was starting out because it was just a part time business. A couple of years later, she felt extremely guilty when she realized that she had accidentally spent more money on the business than the business had brought in. That meant she accidentally spent the family vacation money and money that was actually supposed to be set aside for the kids sports and activity.\
\
[00:04:29.290] - Sylvia\
Another example, I had a business owner tell me that every December her husband would hand her a highlighter and a physical printout of all their credit card statements for the year and asked her to highlight one by one which ones were business expenses so he could claim it on their taxes. Yikes! So, keep in mind, make sure that you have a business checking account and a separate business credit card or debit card to run your business, and having a business checking account does not mean that you have not accidentally been co-mingling your personal and business finances.\
\
[00:05:07.260] - Sylvia\
For example, if you have a business credit card and you are using it to pay for personal expenses as a form of paycheck to yourself, then that's actually co-mingling. And so this becomes a major issue if you are ever audited by the IRS. So just make sure that you don't do it.\
\
[00:05:27.870] - Sylvia\
Mistake number two, not having an emergency fund or savings fund for the business. Most people hear about having a emergency fund for their personal finances. So, they do this for their personal money and shop around for the best rates and the best accounts. But for their business, I find that many small business owners keep all of their money in one checking account. So, by keeping the money separate and having a separate account, it just gives you that mental permission to spend or invest when you know that you have enough money set aside for emergencies and by keeping it in a separate account, you can't accidentally spend it on non emergencies.\
\
[00:06:13.380] - Sylvia\
So, I want to share with you a couple real life examples. So, I had a client who was consistently keeping around $70,000 in her one checking account. She didn't feel like she had enough money to open multiple accounts. But after working together, she opened a savings account just for the business emergency and she made $35 in the first month. And she also shared that it did it allowed her to easily see how much money she had to invest in business opportunities when they came up.\
\
[00:06:44.530] - Sylvia\
I also know another business owner who ran a pretty lean business, she didn't have a lot of monthly operating expenses, but then her father suddenly passed away and she decided to step away from the business for about two months to grieve and be there for her family. So, even though she wasn't working, she still had monthly bills to pay, including all her monthly subscriptions. And she also had to cancel a workshop that she had already collected money for and had already spent the money.\
\
[00:07:15.490] - Sylvia\
And so when she offered to reschedule the workshop in the future, some of those clients and customers asked for a refund. And that was money that she did not have.\
\
[00:07:30.650] - Sylvia\
Mistake number three, not having tax money automatically taken out. So, if you worked in corporate America, the company does this for you. When you start a job at your hands, you form a tax form to complete. And so the company does this for you and takes the taxes out before it gives you your paycheck. And so when you start and have your own business, remember that you are the company. You need to make sure that you take taxes out before you pay the rest of your bills and yourself because you don't want to be empty handed when it comes time to pay your quarterly taxes or your monthly sales tax, because this can cause a lot of stress. If you realize too late that there isn't enough money in the checking account to pay the taxes.\
\
[00:08:22.670] - Sylvia\
Mistake number four, willing to work for free, a.k.a. not having a paycheck. A lot of small business owners tell me that they haven't paid themselves yet. They gave me lots of reasons, including the business isn't making enough money yet or sales fluctuate. So, I don't know how much I can pay myself. Or they pay them so sporadically throughout the year and say whenever I look in the checking account, if there's enough money, I'll pay myself a paycheck. But having this money mindset can actually hold you back even if your business is doing better and making six figures. Because I've known small business owners who do have a six figure business, but they haven't paid themselves a steady paycheck for owners drop and it's for not for lack of money coming in. So, let me ask you, would you work for another company without the promise of a paycheck? I'm assuming the answer is no, but even if you had a sales job that was 100% commission, you would be expected to be paid based on your results, right? If that's the case, when you start your own business, why wouldn't you treat yourself the same way? So, essentially think of yourself as employee number one of your small business.\
\
[00:09:44.850] - Sylvia\
Mistake number five, lowering your prices and discounting on the fly. Just don't do it. It is harder to increase your prices afterwards. If you were in corporate America, you wouldn't lower your asking salary when applying for a new job. Right. Because you know what you're worth and you know how much money that you need to be making in order to pay your mortgage, utilities, food and other bills. However, I find many small business owners do not know how much it costs to keep the lights on in their business. They don't know how much they need to be making in order to be able to pay their bills and themselves. So, then when they get into sales conversations, they start getting nervous talking about money, especially if money hasn't been coming in and they tend to lower their prices or even give discounts on the fly.\
\
[00:10:42.450] - Sylvia\
Mistake number six, trying to do it all. Well, you may feel like you can't afford help and you just can bootstrap the business at the beginning, trying to run the entire business by yourself can actually cost you more money, either an actual cost or opportunity cost. For example, I had a client who was behind in managing her inventory system. She didn't want to pay anyone to help her. But then she found herself in situations where a customer would purchase a product on her website and be given a delivery date. But then she realized that she was out of stock of some of the materials that she needed to complete the product. Then she would have to pay for rush shipping fees to get the material sent to her house so she could make the product and then she would have to pay rush shipping fees in order to get it to the customer on time and buy the promised delivery date. And when we calculated this, we found that she often paid around twenty five to upwards of fifty dollars in these rush shipping fees. So, in the end, she actually didn't make money and sometimes lost money on these shipping fees. So, all she needed to do was hire some temporary help to get her up to speed so that she didn't get herself in these situations.\
\
[00:12:05.470] - Sylvia\
So, here are a few recommendations for how you can buy back more time for yourself and the business, outsource work if you are getting behind or you're doing tasks that aren't in your line of genius.\
\
[00:12:20.320] - Sylvia\
A great resource is a site called Upwork. I've hired people that are, you know, website developers as well as a graphic designer marketing person. You can post a job description or a description of the project that you need help with and then you can just wait for people to apply. Also, use a scheduling tool to book your meetings with prospects, clients and colleagues.\
\
[00:12:48.270] - Sylvia\
How many of you have ever had to trade three to five emails or even more to try to find a date and time that worked for both of you? Right. I've actually had that happen to me once where I lost a prospect. I lost a sale because it took way too long to find a date and time to meet. On the last email exchange, she said, "Thank you for your time, but already found somebody that I could meet with sooner and I've already hired them." So, you may be losing out on sales that you're not even aware of. My favorite tool- scheduling tool is "Book Like a Boss".\
\
[00:13:26.440] - Sylvia\
Next, make sure you budget for a virtual assistant sooner than you think in your business. You know, you may be doing some administrative tasks, you know, that are ten dollars, or maybe you could find somebody for ten dollars an hour to do. And by outsourcing that, you can make even more money in your business because it buys you back that extra hour to go spend on your business and get in front of clients and make a sale.\
\
[00:13:53.000] - Sylvia\
Also, use a social media scheduling tool. Everyone knows that you need to be on social media, but find a tool that will help you automate a share evergreen content. So, that way you're not spending your time or paying for a social media manager to only create and post content once.\
\
[00:14:12.500] - Sylvia\
My favorite tool is called Meet Edgar, you can load in content once, especially if it's evergreen and it can share it. And basically like a jukebox, it will go through the content and will randomly go through and repost the ones app that runs out.\
\
[00:14:31.440] - Sylvia\
Mistake number seven, only accepting cash or checks. So, I am not a fan of requiring customers and clients to pay only by cash or checks just so that you can avoid the credit card fees.\
\
[00:14:45.900] - Sylvia\
A few main reasons why I do not like cash or checks: One, other business owners that they hire you, they will have to send you a ten ninety nine every January if they pay you over a certain threshold in one calendar year. Two, bad checks, I've seen business owners who have received bad checks from clients, and so when the checks balance, there are return check fees that you have to pay. So, essentially, you have to pay the penalty for cashing a bad check. And while you can always follow up with a customer to pay you, you do run the risk of never getting that money, especially for work that you've already delivered. And three, it typically just takes longer to get paid if you don't accept credit cards, because requiring cash or checks is just inconvenient for your customers. You are now asking them to find a physical check, put a stamp on an envelope and mail it to you. So, if they get your invoice when they're on vacation, you're not getting paid until they get back. And so if it takes you longer to get paid, you do run the risk that you aren't able to pay your own bills on time and you may end up incurring a late fee or interest fee.\
\
[00:16:07.010] - Sylvia\
Given that I don't like cash or checks, I do want to share a few tools that do make it easy for customers to pay. One is PayPal almost everyone knows and has PayPal these days. Two, Square. Three, Fresh Books, and this is an alternative to what a lot of people know is quick books.\
\
[00:16:31.810] - Sylvia\
So, PayPal and Square are great for point of sale. So, if you've got a line of, say, 30 people that are standing in line to buy your book at the end of a presentation. Square is great because you can use a device to swipe a credit card and be able to quickly take money. You can't easily do that with a tool like Fresh Books. Fresh Books you would have to create a customer in the system first, then be able to attach an invoice to that customer and have them pay. So, having Fresh Books only wouldn't be good if you do have those point of sale type transactions.\
\
[00:17:05.080] - Sylvia\
Now, the great thing about having a tool like fresh books are books over. Just having PayPal or Square is that these accounting tools do have system reports that they can generate like your profit and loss statement. Your P&L statement is what your CPA needs to do your taxes every year until you can also get reports in these accounting tools to help you figure out where, let's say, outstanding invoices. How much do you have? An outstanding invoices may be able to quickly resend those invoices so you can set up- I personally use Fresh Books and I have a system generate reminders. So, I will say, "You know, send a reminder to the customer three days, one day, you know, before the invoices do." And, "Hey, send a reminder, three days after the invoice is past due." Then you can also my favorite feature is to tack on an automatic late fee. You can say that invoices so many days pass due, the system automatically generates either a percentage or flat fee, late fee to the customer.\
\
[00:18:14.480] - Sylvia\
So, here's a recap of the biggest mistakes. One, comingling personal and business money. Two, not having an emergency fund or savings fund for the business. Three, not having tax money automatically being taken out. Four, being willing to work for free a.k.a no paycheck. Five, lowering your prices and discounting on the fly. Six, trying to do it all. And seven, only accepting cash or checks.\
\
[00:18:53.180] - Sylvia\
So, if you've been making any these mistakes, then here are your action items to avoid these expensive financial mistakes:\
\
[00:19:01.730] - Sylvia\
One opened a separate business bank account for your operating expenses.\
\
[00:19:07.700] - Sylvia\
Open one business, bank account for your business emergency fund.\
\
[00:19:13.620] - Sylvia\
Next, open a separate business bank account for your taxes and then create a system to regularly transfer money into this account, and you'll want to check with your CPA on that amount four set up, an automatic payment or transfer at least one time a month for your owners, draw or paycheck.\
\
[00:19:35.610] - Sylvia\
Next, calculate your cost of goods sold and the time involved so that you know what your minimum asking price should be for all your products and services to ensure a profit. Outsource tasks that you can hire someone to do cheaper and faster. And then allow customers to pay by credit cards and then account for those processing fees when you do your pricing.\
\
[00:20:05.440] - Sylvia\
As a bonus, here's a free mini course on the five top tools to help you save time and money in your small business, you can go to SMI financial coaching.com/tools/Summit.\
\
[00:20:20.890] - Sylvia\
So, what questions do you have? Have you been making any of these financial mistakes? Let's take a look at some of the common questions that I often get, which may be the same as some of your questions.\
\
[00:20:33.940] - Sylvia\
Question number one on co-mingling. Can I just use my business credit card to pay for personal expenses and claim that as an org draw? That's still co-mingling and it gets messy because there's a higher chance that you will forget that that expense was for personal reasons and then you or your accountant will accidentally count that towards business expenses for tax deductions. Then if you were ever audited by the IRS, you will have to pay a penalty as well as late interest fees. So, just don't co-mingle.\
\
[00:21:10.610] - Sylvia\
Question number two, emergency fund, can I just use my personal emergency fund if there are unexpected emergencies in the business? Remember, you want to treat the business as a completely separate entity from you and your personal life, because if both of you have emergency, who wins? Who gets to spend the money?\
\
[00:21:34.350] - Sylvia\
Question number three, tax fun, does this separate account for taxes need to be a checking account or savings account? So, the IRS and I believe most, if not all the states will allow you to pay your taxes directly from a checking or savings account; so it can be either. Just keep in mind that most savings accounts, they do have a maximum number of withdrawals per month. So, as long as you don't think you're going to go over that amount, then you can go with a savings account so you can earn that higher interest.\
\
[00:22:10.330] - Sylvia\
Question number four, paying yourself. What if I'm not sure I can pay myself the same amount every month? We have two options. Number one, treat yourself like any other expense in the business and you can just start off small. You could even go with fifty to one hundred dollars a month and then you can start to increase that as you start to feel more confident and have more money coming in. Option number two, you can always choose to pay yourself a set percentage of last month's profits, for example, 25% of last month's profit. So, then every month you would calculate all of the prior month's profit and then just cut yourself a 25%. owners draw check.\
\
[00:22:56.740] - Sylvia\
Question number five, discounting. What should I do with existing clients if I've been discounting too much for my services? I have two recommendations there. Number one, tell your existing clients that your prices will be going up effective X date, and then just give them plenty of notice. Number two, stop discounting and focus on how you can add more value to the services that you offer to justify those higher prices.\
\
[00:23:29.000] - Sylvia\
Question number six, outsourcing, how do I know what I can afford to hire someone to help me? I recommend that you calculate your yield per hour, essentially, if you spend one hour on the business, how much money could you earn and then compare that to all the tasks that you were doing in the business and look at those tasks that you're currently good doing that you aren't good at or don't like to do. And then next, find out how much it cost to hire someone to do those tasks, and if you could hire someone to do the task for significantly lower than your yield per hour, then you can't afford to not hire someone. That's when you have to outsource so, you could spend that extra hour on your business and make more money.\
\
[00:24:17.550] - Sylvia\
Question number seven, cash or checks, what invoicing and accounting system do you recommend? I recommend Fresh Books because it's easy to learn and it doesn't require you to pay an accountant or CPA to help you set it up unlike Quick Books. And Fresh Books, was a specifically designed for freelancers and service based business owners. In my business, I use Fresh Books for my coaching services and then I do. You square for people purchasing my books at networking events and then I just connect Square to my Facebook account.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.410] - Liz\
I'm really excited for this session because we're going to be talking about something that I've never even thought to do with my websites or even considered. Our wonderful speaker is a world travel seasoned linguist based in Seattle. She has worked in private corporate government agencies, linguist, a language consultant, translator, interpreter, and translation director for 20 years. She's currently working as an interpreter for international conferences and consults businesses and individuals on how to communicate clearly with international audience. She's also the author of the book Translate Your Blog and Website to expand in international markets. A big warm welcome to the Thei Zervaki. I said your name was right?\
\
[00:00:51.230] - Thei\
Thank you. Yes, that's it.\
\
[00:00:52.720] - Liz\
Fantastic.\
\
[00:00:53.380] - Thei\
Thank you so much for inviting me.\
\
[00:00:55.990] - Liz\
Yes, I'm so excited to have you because I literally, this has never crossed my mind and now I've got lots of questions.\
\
[00:01:02.210] - Thei\
Oh, yeah, I'm excited. I want to answer them all if I can.\
\
[00:01:05.460] - Liz\
Yeah. So, basically, the idea is that you translate your blog, so that you can reach other audiences.\
\
[00:01:12.090] - Thei\
Yes.\
\
[00:01:14.070] - Liz\
Beyond just reaching out the audience is what sort of the benefit? How much of a benefit is it to go through this process? Like can you?\
\
[00:01:23.930] - Thei\
Yes, I want to talk about that, yes, directly. The idea is this idea from my book and this project is to help people who have like, you know, established blogs and websites with some, ideally some products, although you don't have to have products and to translate them to expand international. Right. To translate the content and maybe the products as well. It's a process. It's not something that happens overnight. And if you decide to go about it, to start this project is to see it as another kind of, as an expansion of your business.\
\
[00:02:02.660] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:02:05.830] - Thei\
Yeah. There are a lot of things to talk about. The first thing is to talk about the translation of the content, then the URL, then the multilingual SEO. It's a lot of things, you know, that's going on if you decide to go. But before I get into that, the blogs that I found so far that they do that and establish websites, except for the big corporation, right? I mean Microsoft, Apple, Google, all those companies, I mean like other things, they translate the Microsoft Office more than 100 languages. I mean in Apple, I guess the same in Google and all those. The other ones are lifestyle blogs, travel, food, wellness, and even fashion. I found some bilingual blogs in fashion too. Okay. For example, this is what I wanted to tell people, that if you have a website, it's not necessarily a good idea to translate it. If you don't think you have an audience in another country, let's say, for example, you're a dentist and you have a website, does it make sense to translate it in German or in, I don't think so. You have to have like an online presence that is pretty big and then you take it from there and you do what you do.\
\
[00:03:20.590] - Thei\
Ideally, I would start with your Google Analytics and see what people come from. If they come from other countries, and which countries?\
\
[00:03:28.220] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:03:29.060] - Thei\
That's a good start. Yeah.\
\
[00:03:30.630] - Liz\
So that would help you determine what language or languages to work on translating it into, like, hey, these are the best ones to do. It just depends on where your audience is going.\
\
[00:03:40.140] - Thei\
Yeah, that's the first start. Of course, the fact that people come to your website from Germany or Japan doesn't mean necessarily that they want to see the content in English. But it's a good start, though.\
\
[00:03:52.410] - Liz\
Sure.\
\
[00:03:53.260] - Thei\
Yeah.\
\
[00:03:54.120] - Liz\
Okay, so say, you know, you figured out, okay, I have a lot of people coming from, like, Germany, whatever, so I want to create a German version of my site because it is a process. What is the timeline to potentially get that done? Like how long of a process is that?\
\
[00:04:15.570] - Thei\
That depends on how much content you have.\
\
[00:04:17.970] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:04:18.740] - Thei\
You know in translation, you have to know that the projects are based and assessed and evaluated money wise based on the amount of rewards that you have. So, it's not just that I have 20 articles and 50 articles or 50 recipes or 50 how to articles, how to travel in the US or in Germany. It's how many words you have. If you have like, 10,000, 20,000, million, that depends. If you have 50,000 words, you can do it in a month.\
\
[00:04:43.400] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:04:44.220] - Thei\
But if you have 1 million words, probably a year or something six months. That depends also how you go about translation. If you go machine translation, human translation, a combination of the two. Yeah, it's a process. It's a process. Let's say, for example, that you have like, ten blog posts that you want to translate because you think these are your top blog posts in the US. Right? And there are thousand words each. So, you have 20,000 words, and you say, I'm going to do that in German. Let's talk about German. What options do you have? Option number one is to find a human translator. Like, you know, does recruit a translator, freelance translator.\
\
[00:05:27.140] - Thei\
You can get them online from directories, from sites like upwork.com. I don't know Fiverr had translators there. I don't know. I'm not sure. Or do machine translation, like go to Google Translate, DPL Translate. Then after that, you have to recruit someone to edit because ideally, you don't publish something that comes out through a machine. I think Google Penalized, used to penalize people for that. I don't know what they're going to do now with artificial intelligence. Everything is getting into that. And then the third option is to have both, to have a human machine translation product and a human. There is also, if you are on WordPress, the WordPress plugins for translation, they're about 10, 15. I haven't really tested them all. I don't know how well they work. The most famous one and the best one is called the WordPress multilingual plugin. It's not free. Plugins from WordPress is not free for translation. I mean, the free version doesn't give you much, really. You have to pay an annual fee or a monthly fee. And then what they do, you install them and then they kind of duplicate your content, the menu and everything else. And then the translation either is machine translation done through the plugin because they use either Google Translate or any other device too.\
\
[00:06:58.710] - Thei\
And then you, again, you have to do the editing yourself. So, far, from the people I met, the people I didn't really meet, the research I did online, the bilingual blogs are written by bilingual bloggers. It is there from Spain, from Mexico, from Germany, from Japan, from China. So, they do the translation themselves with the aid of machine translation, too. That's how it works so far. I haven't really met someone or seen anything who [crosstalk 00:07:29], yeah, exactly. Except for the big companies, like corporation.\
\
[00:07:34.360] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so you go through th effort. Let's say you go through the effort of translating. You have your blog basically set up, and I want to talk more about the tech. But let's step back. What is the potential like reach or you know like what is the like, hey, I've done this. I now get this many more page views and ad revenue or whatever. What is that big, hey, this is worth doing it? You know what's that potential?\
\
[00:08:02.750] - Thei\
You know, some people, they started day one. They have a bilingual blog from day one, which is something I don't really recommend because it's something I didn't say. Probably you get it. It's additional work. I think that will add to your workflow about 20, 30% more, because you have to do everything, not everything. The content is the same. The blog is the same. It's identical. You don't change it, really. But the work to do that, it's additional work because you have to think a little bit about your SEO, for example, in a different language. Now, what do you do about that if you don't speak the language, if you don't know the language, you have to recruit someone to help you. Right? I would say, ideally, I wouldn't say to be on the 50,000 to have like the ad revenue maybe a little bit alien, but that you can do.\
\
[00:08:57.480] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:08:59.050] - Thei\
But not too early. If you don't have enough traffic for the US. Market, I don't think you should do it in foreign language.\
\
[00:09:05.150] - Liz\
Okay. I like that.\
\
[00:09:06.350] - Thei\
I don't recommend that. just get your traffic in the US. And then you expand.\
\
[00:09:11.210] - Liz\
Okay. So, I want to talk more about the tech side of things because we've touched on it a little bit with plug in. But then does someone that views the English version also see the other language? You know how does that work? Do you use a separate URL?\
\
[00:09:27.350] - Thei\
Okay, basically you have two options. The option one is to have the same domain name and under the domain name to do both languages. The thing is that the plugin or yourself or your developer is going to put two flags on top, the American flag or the, you know, and the Spanish flag. Or you can even say, EN ES, English, Espanol, or whatever. And then if you want to read the Spanish version, you click on the Spanish flag or the Spanish word. Right? It's the same domain name. There are bloggers though who did two versions of the same blog. Let's say you have a blog, I love coffee, and then they created a blog in spanish@cafemegusta.com or MX, Mexico, whatever it is. So, you have two identical blogs that then you start from English, I think, and then you translate into Spanish, and then you duplicate your content, and they use actually the exact images too. It's amazing. Okay, so I think there's been a while that I was reading about this woman. I think she's Mexican, she's based in Texas, and she does that. She has a food blog, and she said that it's identical, basically everything. She does the translation herself with the aid of machine translation.\
\
[00:10:50.750] - Thei\
She has two blogs. Basically, she says as if she has two blocks, even if they are the same, because they're two different languages. Okay.\
\
[00:10:58.290] - Liz\
I would think that going either route, it's about the same amount of work. Is that okay? So, it doesn't matter if you choose to do it under a single domain or two domains. Yeah, you might have a little more tech to deal with on the single domain so that people can switch between.\
\
[00:11:13.930] - Thei\
Yeah, I think maybe it's a bit easier too, because you have both versions on the same page and you can switch. If you do two different domain names, people don't really know that you have two. If you go to the English version, you don't know that there is the Spanish version. But this particular blogger, she was saying in her article that I was reading that the Spanish version gives her the traffic from all the speaking countries, like Mexico, Argentina, Colombia. That's how she gets her traffic from. She doesn't get traffic from all those countries to the American blog from the american blog. The English version of the blog.\
\
[00:11:56.450] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah.\
\
[00:11:57.020] - Thei\
So, it makes things a little bit confusing. So, you have to be clear of your objectives, too. What do you want to get out of the two, right? Now the other thing I have to mention that people have to think about, too, it's seasonality for lifestyle blogs, like recipes, for example. Do you publish the same recipe that you make in Thanksgiving in the US for the Spanish version of your blog that they don't have Thanksgiving, right?\
\
[00:12:25.040] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:12:25.580] - Thei\
Or the summer recipe...\
\
[00:12:28.750] - Liz\
When it's winter in Australia.\
\
[00:12:30.550] - Thei\
Yeah, exactly. That's the thing. Then also, you can even expand that if you sell products, if you sell like guides or fashion. You have to think a little bit about that, too. That particular blog, she said that she does everything identical. She doesn't change it. If it's a Thanksgiving meal in English, she's going to do it in Spanish too. That makes things simple, easier.\
\
[00:12:57.130] - Liz\
I would say you're trying to create higher conversions by making sure you're targeting based on where they're located and what, you know, season is for them. Summer, spring, fall.\
\
[00:13:06.400] - Thei\
Yeah. That's very good that you said the Australian example, if you have like, a fashion blog and you focus on hats, gloves and coats, the winter in Australia, it's not going to have, like, bikinis. You have to decide. Yes, probably you should, but I don't know what you do. You have to think about those.\
\
[00:13:24.380] - Liz\
You might have identical content, but publishing at different times [crosstalk 00:13:27].\
\
[00:13:28.050] - Thei\
That also very technical too, have to organize the tech. And then another thing is social media. Why would you do that? Where you promote, which countries? And the social media language thing is another beast because some, like Facebook, has machine translation to on Facebook. I don't think Instagram does. Pinterest is multilingual. You can have the same Pin in different languages on the same account.\
\
[00:13:55.440] - Liz\
[inaudible 00:13:55] it's probably not as big of a deal. Whereas Facebook and Instagram, like those.\
\
[00:14:00.950] - Thei\
They disappear. Exactly. Yeah.\
\
[00:14:02.100] - Liz\
Flash in the pan.\
\
[00:14:03.080] - Thei\
In ten minutes. I didn't know that. Just speaking about that. That some people, they post the same images for lifestyle blogs again on Facebook three times a day. I didn't know they can do that. I thought they penalize you, but they don't because they say, oh, different people see the same image at different times.\
\
[00:14:23.730] - Liz\
Yes. I am not a social media expert. It is something I try to make more time to do. But this is also why I'm very grateful for our other wonderful speakers who share their knowledge. So, I only take.\
\
[00:14:37.210] - Thei\
What do they do? Yeah, I know. I know.\
\
[00:14:39.130] - Thei\
So that's the other thing. You have to think of the seasonality of the other country that you translate to.\
\
[00:14:48.140] - Liz\
Yeah. And it might not be a single country. Like you said, Spanish is spoken.\
\
[00:14:52.900] - Thei\
I all countries. Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:14:54.270] - Liz\
I mean, there's different dialects, though, right? Mexican Spanish is very different from Chile Spanish.\
\
[00:14:59.370] - Thei\
Yeah. And also European Spanish is very different than us.\
\
[00:15:02.620] - Liz\
Which is different from Spain. Yeah, I learned that when I started [inaudible 00:15:07] in Chile.\
\
[00:15:10.290] - Thei\
Yeah. I think it's really, yeah, we have to think about all the cultural, seasonality aspect of everything.\
\
[00:15:18.230] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay, I like that point. All right, any final tips you want to give someone who wants to consider expanding in this way to help them scale?\
\
[00:15:30.810] - Thei\
I think that's the basics. Now it's entirely up to the blogger or website owner what they're going to do. You can start only with five articles if you want to. You don't have to do the whole site and see how people respond. I think I met a travel blogger a few years ago in a conference and she had a big massive travel blog for ten years. So, she had she had millions of words, she told me. Oh, yeah, definitely millions of words. And she said she had a lot of requests because the travel blog was about traveling in the US with family and kids. She had requests from Mexico and China. So, she said, okay, people ask me, they wanted their language, right, because they didn't get the American English. So, she said, I'm going to start with the ten articles first and then see what happens. You pick your most top articles in the US. And then you translate that in Spanish and Maldarino, Cantonese in this case, if you're going to do China and see what happens. Then you expand after that, another ten, and another ten. And that's also more manageable time wise and money wise and everything.\
\
[00:16:36.930] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:16:37.380] - Thei\
I mean, there is an additional cost to all that. Even the plugins cost money. You probably have to recruit someone to translate or edit translation, not an all or nothing thing.\
\
[00:16:48.050] - Liz\
You can sort of test the waters before you have to.\
\
[00:16:50.950] - Thei\
You have to test the waters, so you have to test the water. Yeah. You have to see how you do money wise, time wise, and what you get back, you know.\
\
[00:16:58.710] - Liz\
Yes. Yes. Okay. And I know you have some resources for our wonderful attendees. Do you want to tell them about that?\
\
[00:17:08.560] - Thei\
Yes. The freebie I give out is the eight step guide to translate your blog or your website. So, it's kind of an easy I think it's ten pages, twelve pages guide that it works you around the different steps you have to follow to start translating your blog or website if you want to. So, if you follow that process, things will become much easier. First, you have to know what translation is, how to find a translator, how you approach that project. You have to have clear objectives about that, what you want to get out of it.\
\
[00:17:48.710] - Liz\
So, if you're thinking of testing the waters with translation, start with this freebie to learn more about that process.\
\
[00:17:54.870] - Thei\
Exactly. I think that will give you an idea that you...\
\
[00:17:58.090] - Liz\
Yes or no? Yeah.\
\
[00:18:01.290] - Thei\
You have to know how much time you have, how much money you have, if it's worth it for you, and see if it works, you know. Some people, they say that actually all the multilingual blogs or bloggers that I am familiar with, they're all happy to do that. They say it's more work, 20-30% more, but they're quite happy about it, so you know.\
\
[00:18:23.070] - Liz\
It might be 20% to 30% more work, but a 50 or 100% return, right? So, it depends.\
\
[00:18:29.550] - Thei\
Yeah, we definitely have more traffic. And also they built a different community, too, you know, in a different country or different countries, you know. They have a different community, different funds in other countries.\
\
[00:18:41.070] - Liz\
Yes. All right. And then you also have something for those that have gotten the all access pass or are considering.\
\
[00:18:47.580] - Thei\
Oh, yeah, it's my book. I put a lot of time to do that book. It's about 100 pages. It's in PDF. This one. Translate your blog and website to expand it in international markets. That gives you everything. The research. How many people read in English, how many people read in different languages, how many people shop the expansion of the blogs in the future, there is some stats that is very useful to know and then all the things you need to know to go about the translation process with some resources at the end. Awesome.\
\
[00:19:19.060] - Liz\
So, definitely, if you haven't gotten the all access pass and that is of interest to you, definitely go grab the all access pass. Again, Thei, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. Super helpful. I have a couple of things to think about now. I appreciate it.\
\
[00:19:33.600] - Thei\
You have to think about your website too.\
\
[00:19:36.890] - Liz\
Yes. All right, thanks.\
\
[00:19:38.490] - Thei\
Thank you.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.250] - Liz, Host\
Hey, guys, I'm really excited for this next session with our speaker. She is a project manager and just all around sort of back in business genius. And I'm excited to ask her some questions because I know there's some things I've struggled with as I've grown, so let's give a big, warm welcome to Tressa Behiem. Tressa, thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:32.630] - Tressa\
No problem. I'm excited to chat with you today.\
\
[00:00:35.730] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Because it's funny when I hired my first VA, it was almost like I need her to train me on how to work with a VA. Right.\
\
[00:00:45.790] - Tressa\
I hear that a lot. Yeah.\
\
[00:00:47.870] - Liz, Host\
Because business owners were always, like, doing everything. And so when we get to the point where we can actually outsource, it's a struggle. I guess the first question I have is, what do you see as business owners biggest struggle as they're growing and scaling and trying to work with others?\
\
[00:01:03.990] - Tressa\
So, I would say one of the biggest struggles is so many of us started a business, not necessarily to have a team. Right. We started a business because we wanted the flexibility or we wanted to kind of be able to do our own thing. And then as the business grows, you realize, oh, wait a second. I can't actually do all of this myself. And I need people to help me. But how do I find those people? And how do I train those people? And how do I manage those people? And you know you might be really good at blogging or creating products or coaching. But managing people and managing projects is a very different thing. And so, you kind of get into this spot where you're like, I need to focus on doing the things I'm really good at. But I also need these people to help me, and I don't really know how to get them to help me. Right. So, that tends to be one of the biggest struggles that I noticed. And people just don't know where to start, and then they don't know how to continue once they kind of get started.\
\
[00:02:07.180] - Liz, Host\
Sure. So where would you recommend people start?\
\
[00:02:10.530] - Tressa\
So, it really depends on your business, and it depends on what it is you're deciding to outsource. So, you know some people will start with a VA. Some people will start with an OVM like me, and then some people will start with someone who can do the same type of work that they do because they have too much client work or something like that. And so, it really depends on what the biggest need in your business is. But what I always recommend when people ask me this question is, what is going to help you grow your revenue as efficiently as possible? Right. So if you're drowning in admin and you need more time to work on revenue generating activities in the business, you're probably going to be best served by hiring a VA who can help you with some of that admin. If you're more sort of drowning in, I have way too much client work to do and not enough time to do it, or I have way too much writing to do, you might want to hire somebody who can help with that particular skill set. And then when people tend to need an OVM like me, it tends to be more that they have a lot of I don't want to say arms of their business, but they might have a lot of different things.\
\
[00:03:35.500] - Liz, Host\
Like maybe they have courses and they have products and they have coaching and they have several different, yeah. So, it's like you have to manage different revenue streams, and that means typically you need to have different types of marketing. You need to have all these things. And so that's where a project manager and OVM will come in because they can take a lot of that off your plate.\
\
[00:04:03.730] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, how do you look at the overwhelming amount of stuff that many bloggers business owners have and decide? Okay. What do I want to maintain ownership over and what can I delegate.\
\
[00:04:17.050] - Tressa\
So, again, it kind of depends.\
\
[00:04:20.190] - Liz, Host\
Sure. That's always going to be the answer.\
\
[00:04:21.640] - Tressa\
But yeah, you're going to hear me say that a lot. But again, typically the best thing to do is start with a plan. Right. Look at all the different things that you have currently on your plate. One of my favorite exercises to do with clients is using the Eisenhower matrix, so we can kind of look at what's important but you know not urgent, what's urgent but not important. All that four squares. Right. Because when we put everything in those four squares, you can start to see a pattern of, oh, my inbox, my customer, all my people that are messaging me and comments and things like that, like that is important because that's what helps grow my traffic. But it's not urgent. Right. And so, that tends to sometimes go by the wayside because we get a little too busy. And so, looking at what are the things that are going to help move the business forward? And what are the things that need to be done but not necessarily done by me. Right. So, a lot of times, things like responding to customer emails or responding to comments or posting your social media that doesn't necessarily have to be done by the business owner.\
\
[00:05:42.650] - Liz, Host\
It needs to be done by someone, but not necessarily the business owner or the blogger. They can create some SOPs and kind of teach somebody how to do that. So, if you start by looking at what are the things that I could explain to someone else, I could teach someone else. And that don't require my level of expertise to do, that's where you start, right. And then once you get those kinds of things off your plate, you typically have a little bit more capacity to think about some of the other things and start to be more strategic about, you know, maybe I could have a writer help me create some of my content. Or maybe I could have somebody help me with my social media. But typically, when you're first getting started, you're so overwhelmed that you know even thinking about those more.\
\
[00:06:31.780] - Liz, Host\
It's taking on something else trying to find somebody.\
\
[00:06:34.930] - Tressa\
Exactly. It feels like this is just another thing I have to do. Right. And so, starting with the sort of easiest thing to outsource is typically the best way to go.\
\
[00:06:46.660] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, a couple of follow up questions from that and a comment. One of the best things I've ever heard was if you could find someone that can do what you do at least 80% as well, let it go. Like you don't need to be a perfectionist.\
\
[00:07:01.060] - Tressa\
Yes. Absolutely.\
\
[00:07:02.830] - Liz, Host\
But then the other thing is, you said SOP. And I feel like there's a lot of sort of corporate lingo that applies to businesses, businesses that don't really translate. They don't think about it or they're not familiar with it. And SOP is one of them. So, if you wouldn't mind explaining what an SOP is and how you go about creating them.\
\
[00:07:22.540] - Tressa\
Yeah. SOPs actually have a bunch of different names. You may have heard them referred to as SOPs, which is just short for standard operating procedure. You may have heard them referred to as a system. Right. That's another way that people will often refer to them. And basically what it is is a documented way that you do something, right. So, for bloggers, it could just be, a good example is this is how I post my blog on my website. And these are the things that follow after the blog is posted. Right. And a lot of times, you just do it because you've done it so many times, you don't even think about it. But when you try to ask someone else to do it, they sit down and they do it, you know they don't do it wrong. Right? Because typically, if you're hiring someone, they know how to post a blog, so they're going to post it. But they might not write the alt text image the way that you want them to, or they might not know that it's also supposed to be shared to Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest and LinkedIn, or wherever you share it. Right. So, if you create that system or that process, you can document everything that you want to happen so that you could hand it to someone else to do it.\
\
[00:08:39.410] - Tressa\
And it would be 80%, ideally, hopefully 100%. But the first time someone does it, they're more likely to get that 80% if they have some instructions to follow, as opposed to just I'm going to do it the way I've kind of always done it. And hopefully that's okay.\
\
[00:08:56.830] - Liz, Host\
Quick tip. As I've learned as I've created more, SOPs in my business, don't just be like, oh, I need to create an write it out, write it as you're doing it because you will otherwise definitely forget so many steps that you don't even realize are steps, like just click here or whatever you want it to be like pretending they aren't familiar with what the back end of your site looks like. They don't know where to click or whatever. That's something I've learned.\
\
[00:09:23.110] - Tressa\
Absolutely. And if you already have a VA, this is actually something that you can have them do for you. So, one of the things that clients will often do for me and for my team is we'll ask them, just turn on Zoom, turn on Zoom. Whatever you use that will record your screen and just do the task. Walk us through verbally with it on your screen, what you're doing, it'll take you a couple extra minutes, right. Because you're kind of talking through you're going a little slower, but then give us the video. We can type it up for you. And then once it's all typed up with instructions, you can just take a quick look and make sure that nothing got missed. But often that's like ten times faster for the business owner than actually sitting there and trying to type it up. If creating systems is a skill and you kind of have to know how to provide those instructions. And so, people will sometimes get really stressed about it. Like, am I doing this right? Am I giving the right details? So, just record it and then let your team be the one to actually type it up for you.\
\
[00:10:24.750] - Liz, Host\
Sure. So, let's dive into kind of the system side a little bit more because it's great to have all those SOPs. But if you can't find them or, you know, they're not all in one place, or whatever. So, what sort of systems do you recommend? Business owners have to stay organized. Stay on top of things. Things are falling through the cracks. Like, what do you?\
\
[00:10:49.570] - Tressa\
Yeah. So, this is somewhat going to be dependent on your personal preferences. Some people like to keep it really simple and you can really keep your systems organized with something as simple as a Google spreadsheet. Right. What I typically recommend is whatever you're going to do, start with having that first before you create any of the systems, because then you can train yourself to get in the habit of every time you create it, you just add it to that place, so that they never get lost. Right. So, it can be something as simple as a spreadsheet where you just maybe have a couple of tabs that have, like, marketing, you know admins, operations, whatever sort of major categories you're working on, documenting and then everything that you create just automatically automatically make sure that it gets added there. There's also lots of software, like one that's really popular is called Train you all, and they actually help you create SOPs they've got lots of templates. It kind of is a repository where you can save everything and it also gives you some guidance on how to create them. But a lot of people, you know they don't want to pay for another tool.\
\
[00:12:00.690] - Tressa\
They don't want to learn how to use another tool, and so, you know keep it simple, google spreadsheet, if you use Notion, that can also be a really great way to house them. But really, you just want to think about how does your brain work. And if spreadsheets are not your thing, then maybe don't do a spreadsheet and try something like Notion or even your project management tool, if you use one, can be set up to kind of organize them that way. Yeah.\
\
[00:12:29.880] - Liz, Host\
All my stuff can cook up all my SOPs.\
\
[00:12:31.760] - Tressa\
Exactly.\
\
[00:12:31.960] - Liz, Host\
They're like document with sub pages. And yeah. Exactly. Okay. Now we talk about systems and everything. You've mentioned finding someone. How do you find someone to help you?\
\
[00:12:46.690] - Tressa\
So, there's lots of different options. And it really depends on your comfort level, and it depends on how long term you think you want to keep this person. So, I would say the most common three ways are you can go through a service. Right. So, you can use an agency where you're hiring someone specifically from an agency that specializes in providing VA's, or social media, or something like that. You can use something like Upwork, or Fiverr, or you can post a job description somewhere and hope that your network will help you find someone. Right. Yeah. And you know all three are valid. All three have their pros and cons. But when we're talking about kind of an agency or Fiverr, Fiverr/Upwork, a lot of times, you're going to get a lot of variety in what you get. Right. You might find someone who is absolutely fantastic, and you might find someone who looks really good on paper, but then ends up not being so great. So, whenever possible, I always tell people, ask around, right. If you're in a community with a lot of bloggers, ask them, who do you know? Have you worked with anybody that's really good?\
\
[00:14:03.700] - Tressa\
Or do you know of any agencies that are really good? That's always your best place to start, because if you can find somebody who a colleague has worked with, that is really good, you're much more likely to get someone who knows what they're doing for what you need quicker.\
\
[00:14:23.290] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. And I think in my experience, Fiverr and Upwork, those are more kind of not necessarily long term.\
\
[00:14:30.670] - Tressa\
Exactly. Exactly.\
\
[00:14:32.410] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. I use them to help me with transcriptions for the summit, which for a small portion of the year is a lot. But then isn't really much of anything. And I always have them do a paid, but like a test project like here.\
\
[00:14:45.000] - Tressa\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:14:45.820] - Liz, Host\
Try you with one, and I will pay you for it, because I don't believe in having to do free work, but that way I can see what's on paper matches with the results.\
\
[00:14:57.160] - Tressa\
And that's really the easiest, fastest way to test somebody out is just give them a task that you know exactly how it should be done and roughly how long it should take to do it. And then when you get it back, you can evaluate the quality and look at it. And of course, we have to take into consideration if this is the first time they've done something for you, we don't expect it to be perfect, and we don't expect it to take exactly as long as it would take you within reason, right.\
\
[00:15:25.250] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. Yeah. Can they follow the directions?\
\
[00:15:27.920] - Tressa\
Exactly.\
\
[00:15:28.550] - Liz, Host\
Are they listening to the feedback you provide them? Are they asking questions?\
\
[00:15:34.030] - Tressa\
How painful was it to get the task done? Right?\
\
[00:15:39.710] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. And sometimes they make it through the first round, and then later it's real painful.\
\
[00:15:46.130] - Tressa\
Yes. Absolutely.\
\
[00:15:48.650] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, I think one of the things that scares people a lot in terms of trying to bring on someone to help them is the cost. And obviously, it's going to vary widely based on the tasks and the level of experience, and you know how can people sort of prepare their mindset to figure out, okay, what am I willing to pay and what kind of results is that going to get me in return?\
\
[00:16:15.030] - Tressa\
Yeah. So, I think the first thing to do is really to look at your budget and determine how much flex room do I have? How much do I actually have to work with? And then also to ask yourself, what kind of person am I looking for? Am I looking for someone who can do this without any direction, without any management? I just need them to do the thing, right? That type of person you're probably going to have to pay a bit more because they're going to need to have more experience. They're going to need to know what they're doing, right. Whereas if you're willing to train somebody, you're willing to manage them, you're willing to support them, you might be able to hire at a, you know less experienced level. And you know typically, that means it can be a bit cheaper. And then I would also look at what is this money, this amount that I'm spending going to allow me to do? Right? For some people, that means I'm going to be able to scale my business and for other people, they're not even worried about scaling their business, they're worried about. I want to be able to take Fridays off.\
\
[00:17:26.120] - Tressa\
I want to be able to spend the weekend with my kids. I don't want to have to worry about posting or commenting or doing any of these things. And so, sometimes it's not cut and dry, like if I pay this much, I'm going to make this much. But if I pay this much, I'm going to have you know XYZ possible. Right. So, just getting really clear on how much can I afford and what are my goals? What am I trying to accomplish by hiring this person? I find to be really helpful.\
\
[00:17:58.290] - Liz, Host\
Sure. No. I think that's a great point. Because it's not always a direct ROI on what you're paying out. Your sanity is worth something. Absolutely. Okay. So, I wonder if you could give some examples of things you've seen your clients or whoever delegating that or maybe some of the easiest things to delegate and some of the more difficult things.\
\
[00:18:25.690] - Tressa\
Yeah. So, starting with some of the easiest things, scheduling your social media is pretty easy, right? It doesn't require a whole lot of skill. It doesn't require a whole lot of experience. It's just, I need you to schedule this content that I've already created, and you can hand somebody follow this schedule, right.\
\
[00:18:45.930] - Tressa\
So, something like that is usually pretty easy. Even setting up blog posts is pretty simple, right. Because we're not asking them to actually create any content. We're just asking them to take the content that's already been created and put it somewhere. Right. So, things that are repetitive, things that are done exactly the same way every single time tend to be a bit easier to delegate, especially if there's no nuance. Right. So, sometimes people will start with, oh, I need somebody to help me with my scheduling. I need somebody to help me with my calendar. And in some ways, calendar can be easy because you can kind of create structure and you can have some rules. But there's often a lot of nuance when it comes to calendar because it's like, well, I might be willing to break my rule if it's a person who got a lot of potential. Right. Or you know, oh, my kid doesn't actually have school every Thursday afternoon, it's only every other Thursday afternoon. Right. So, people often start with that, and then they get really frustrated because it's not effective. But it's because there's typically so much nuance in your schedule. It just doesn't feel that way.\
\

It feels very cut and dry to you. Something else that I find often people struggle to delegate is bigger projects. Sometimes, that's because they don't always have a clear sense of what that project is going to look like. So, they might want somebody to help them set up a webinar or a summit. Right. And they might say, oh, well, you can just help me with this, right. But if you don't necessarily know everything that needs to be done, it's very hard to have someone help you with that.\
\
[00:20:44.830] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. My VA is like, hey, I've got some time for you. What do you need? And I'm like, oh, I've got like, mindless tasks coming out of my ears where you just got to click things before me. Yes.\
\
[00:20:53.570] - Tressa\
Exactly. Exactly.\
\
[00:20:56.290] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, we talked about, like, scheduling social media stuff. Some of these things can actually be automated with tools as opposed to people. So, at what point do you kind of make the decision to go with a tool versus a person and the cost difference, and yeah?\
\
[00:21:11.890] - Tressa\
Even scheduling your social media typically has to be someone has to go into the tool, right? And add the post I typically think about, with automation, if it's something again, that is very simple, very cut and dry, I post something on Instagram. And I automatically want it to go to all these other places, and there's no nuance. It doesn't make sense to have somebody manually scheduling on all those different platforms. Right. We would have them schedule it for us once, and then the tool would be the one to post it in all those places. But if we're talking about something again, that's a little bit more complex, a little bit more nuanced. Tools tend to be a bit more challenging, and the more complex they get, the more expensive they get. And so it starts to add up to where suddenly you have $2,000 a month in recurring charges from all the things, and you don't even know where they all came from. So, really, just thinking about what is this going to help me do? And is this actually going to save time, are typically the two things that I like to look at?\
\
[00:22:28.440] - Liz, Host\
Okay. No, I like that because I'm definitely a tool junkie. I have to restrict myself from going to [inaudible 00:22:35] sometimes.\
\
[00:22:39.810] - Tressa\
Yes. For sure.\
\
[00:22:40.070] - Liz, Host\
Alright. So, do you have any kind of final words of advice for people that are, you know trying to step up their game, potentially working with the team, just, any final words?\
\
[00:22:52.050] - Tressa\
Being really clear on what you need. And also, what are your deal breakers, right? What are the things that just aren't going to work for you and for your business? Getting really, really clear on those before you hire is absolutely helpful, because then you know what you're looking for and you know what is not okay with you before you're in the moment. If you're in the moment trying to figure those things out, it's a lot more stressful than if, you know, X is not okay with me. So, if it happens, I've already made the decision that that's not going to work. And I want this particular characteristic or I want this particular value. And so that is really important to me when I'm looking to hire somebody.\
\
[00:23:44.130] - Liz, Host\
Yeah, that's fantastic. It's so much harder to look at it when you're in it.\
\
[00:23:50.010] - Liz, Host\
Alright.\
\
[00:23:50.420] - Liz, Host\
And I think people should follow you on Instagram. You want to drop your handle?\
\
[00:23:54.820] - Tressa\
Yeah, absolutely. It's just Tressy Behiem, so, it's just my name. If you just search that, I'm sure the spelling is going to be in the description.\
\
[00:24:05.010] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Yes. I believe the link as well will be somewhere on the page, I forget where. But yeah. Tressa, thank you so much for sharing this information. It was super helpful. I made lots of notes myself, and yeah, thank you so much.\
\
[00:24:19.860] - Liz, Host\
You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day.\
