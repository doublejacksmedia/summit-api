Hi everyone. Welcome to today's session. My name is Anca and I'm a social media strategist here at SocialBee. Over the past 10 years, I've had the pleasure of working with businesses to help them maximize their online presence and stay ahead of social media trends. Today, I'm excited to have to be here and discuss with you some of the potential 2025 social media trends that you won't be able to ignore. So let's dive right in. These are a few of the trends that we're going to go over in today's talk, but before we do that, let me know which trends do you think will move on into 2025. So I'm gonna go ahead and start with the first trend that we have on our roster today, and that is the rise of niche social media networks.

Anca Pop [00:01:10]:
We're actually seeing a significant shift towards niche networks, and you can think of these as communities built around specific interests or specific demographics. For instance, you can look at Cara. That is a social media platform that caters to artists. This shift is driven by the growing desire for more more of a personalized experience, and it looks for data transparency as well. So unlike mainstream platforms which are more general looking, these niche networks will offer tighter knit communities and more relevant content for that targeted audience. So this trend presents a unique opportunity for brands and if you're targeting a specific, a specific industry, a specific audience, things like that, it's worth exploring, these smaller, more targeted platforms, where users might be more highly engaged. You can look at platforms, as I mentioned, like Cara who's, a catering to artists. You can look at platforms like, Caffeine, which is a similar one, but for gaming and gamers or even Goodreads, which is a platform that is dedicated to readers, to book readers.

Anca Pop [00:02:35]:
And you can connect with authors and leave reviews on the books and things like that. So these are very, niched, very industry forward platforms that will be, generating more interest and more authenticity from your followers as well. The second trend that we're looking at is social media acting as a search engine. Over the past few years, we've already seen this happen with platforms like Instagram, like TikTok, like Pinterest, platforms that have been evolving into search engines. You heard that right. As a matter of fact, over 40% of Gen Zers are reportedly using TikTok instead of Google when it comes to their searches. So they are TikToking more than they are Googling. This will be the new verb, I tell you.

Anca Pop [00:03:31]:
A significant number of these users now rely on platforms that are social to find relevant products that they might need to solve issues, to explore trends, or to discover new ideas. So to capitalize on this shift, you as a brand must strategically think about the search visibility of your content. So, essentially, what I'm trying to say is that incorporating natural keywords into your social media posts, into your captions, hashtags, alt text, and everything included, will help you make your content more findable or more searchable or more SEO friendly, if you will. Additionally, it will help you leverage, features like the alt text that I just mentioned or TikTok's SEO options and help you with optimizing your content in that direction. So in here, I guess there's there's a shift that's happening from traditional SEO into, into the social media world and how content now is becoming very SEO friendly in a more natural way than traditional SEO would, would make it. The 3rd big trend that we have over here is the decline of intrusive advertising. So in the recent years, we've seen users become increasingly wary of ads that are intrusive or disruptive in nature. We've noticed that people tend to prefer ads that are relevant, ads that are contextual, that are personalized to their experience, and to the platform that they are currently using.

Anca Pop [00:05:25]:
This is why you'll find that TikTok, will have more natively integrated ads than other platforms that you might be seeing. With TikTok, it's a whole experience that can be very easily disruptive and distraught if you are just scrolling and you just find a different ad that takes you out of that scrolling phase. So, users tend to prefer ads that are seamlessly integrated in their in their social media experience, in their feed. As a matter of fact, there's a recent survey that showed that around, 70% ish of users skip the ads if they find them disruptive or if they find them irrelevant. So it's very important to target the right audience and to make sure that you're integrating the ad as natively as possible. What does this mean for a brand? Well, you'll need to get creative, first of all. You'll need to make sure that you collaborate with influencers, with content creators, that you're leveraging native ad trends and that you're blending this within your content strategy. So instead of using traditional ads, you might want to consider sponsored posts or, telling stories or, video ads that just provide the value upfront.

Anca Pop [00:06:56]:
So these are the types of of ads that we're seeing might work better moving forward as opposed to more intrusive advertising tactics. We're moving on to the 4th, trend and that is the best social media strategies are just that, they are social. This is one of the most fundamental principles of social media and it's something that's not necessarily a trend more so than a reminder. So, if you're only broadcasting messages without engaging with your audience, without making sure that you, create a community and and an an an a a level of interaction with your socials and your audience, you might be missing the point. It's crucial, as a brand on social media, to actively comment on posts, to reply to any mentions, to any comments, to any DMs, to participate in conversations that are relevant to your brand. So one tip that I have in this sense is to create a community building strategy. This will have, will involve, you interacting with your audience on a more deeper level so that you create that sense of community. So my advice to you would be to maybe start discussions, to conduct polls, to encourage user generated content, to encourage your audience to talk to you as much as possible.

Anca Pop [00:08:33]:
So what you'll see is that, the more you do it, the more of a success you you get. And there's different ways to do this as well. So you can go the helpful approach or you can do a more funny, and humorous approach like Wendy's does for for instance, which is an excellent way to engage with your community by responding with humor instead of of helpfulness, so to speak, and making making sure that followers are part of a community in this sense. The 5th trend is talking a little more about a shift from viral content into more of a quality content. So the days of prioritizing viral content for the sake of just fame that's fleeting away are gone. They're gone. Instead, we're seeing a shift towards more meaningful engagement as I was saying in the previous one and more audience connection, more of this instead of just virality. Not to say that virality is not important, but it's not important in every single post that you have.

Anca Pop [00:09:57]:
So it's no longer about creating the next viral meme or, about being overnight famous and getting a lot of followers and things like that. But rather, it's about reaching the right people with the content that they resonate with deeply. So you can look at this and figure out how you can avoid getting caught in maybe chasing viral success and just create the content that you feel is authentic to you and that you feel will be relevant and authentic to your particular audience. That's all that matters. The 6th trend that we're talking about is social media for customer service. So in this case, we're talking about how social media is not just for marketing these days, but actually, it's a powerful tool that you can use for customer service, for customer success, and so on. Actually, by engaging with your customers in real time and making sure that you address their concerns, publicly, you can make sure that you're giving transparency, that you're giving commitment to your audience. Brands like JetBlue, for instance, have turned social media into a customer service channel by making sure that they respond quickly and proactively to any particular problem that their audience might be having.

Anca Pop [00:11:33]:
So in this case, it's important to monitor brand mentions to make sure that you always do, kind of a sentiment analysis on your social media and make sure that you stay ahead of potential problems. It's also important to resolve any issues that come up in a prompt manner as well as professional manner so that, the overall sentiment is a happy one, a positive note for your brand. And this will help with make sure with making sure that your content and your your presence online, stays top of mind to your audience whenever they need you. It's as simple as that. I'm gonna drink some water and then we continue with the 7th, trend. Okay. So trend number 7. This is the rise of de influencing.

Anca Pop [00:12:38]:
Influencing. If you're familiar with influencing, and influencers in general, it's, a a type of content creator that will, cause users to maybe purchase more of specific products, in, in favor of of specific brands. So with de influencing, This trend is the exact opposite of that. So it's it's actually a fascinating trend where you see influencers and users of all kind, content creators, actively discourage people from purchasing overhyped or ineffective products. This is a trend that kind of is needed, because there has always been and and I think in most recent years more so than in the past, there's been a desire for authenticity and accountability that brands seem to have a lower concern for in the previous years. So to align with this shift, you must focus on transparency, on honest marketing, making sure that you say when things are great and when things are not as great. It's also important to say and be honest about things that maybe are not as great as anyone would think. So you can look about de influencing, products that might no longer be helpful to you or your community and replacing them with something else that, will build your consumer trust.

Anca Pop [00:14:29]:
So so, yeah, build genuine relationships with brands, with bloggers, with communities, and make sure that you work towards building that trust that will allow you to influence and deinfluence at the same time. That's, my prediction for this particular, trend. Now we're moving into the 8th and final trend, which is integrating multiple marketing channels. So in 2025, we're seeing more brands move towards more integrated marketing campaigns. Social media is no longer a standalone channel, but a vital piece in a broader spectrum puzzle. You can look at brands to ensure consistency across all of these touchpoints, whether it's email marketing, websites, in store experiences, online with social media, and so much more. These are more integrated and unified in what brands have as a marketing strategy and not different strategies for different purposes. So, in this case, you can think of it, the social media channels.

Anca Pop [00:15:41]:
You can think of them as kind of like the glue that, binds all of these efforts together And you can think of examples, like the one on the screen. Instead of simply directing users to an article, engage with them through interactive content and conversations that lead to deeper engagement. This is one simple way to take a blog article, which is a separate type of marketing, introduce it into your social media scene, and work with it together to create conversation within your social media channels while also driving traffic to your blog so that people can read, that article in more depth. So that's just one option. These are all of the trends that I have for 2025. I'm curious to see how many of these, you had on your list. So let me know, if you had them or not. I do have some additional help and additional tips and tricks that I wanna share with you next.

Anca Pop [00:16:53]:
So just kind of to wrap it up, I wanna leave you with this particular thought. Social media management is a battle, that's fought on multiple fields. It is constantly evolving and it it's and it's very important for you to stay ahead of trends in order to remain relevant. By making sure that you embrace these trends, so niche networks, search engine optimization, centric approach, by making sure your ads are contextual, by making sure that you're prioritizing genuine connections, by making sure that you're aligning yourself with the right people online, I think that you'll be ready to thrive in 2025 when it comes to social media marketing. And the best part is that you can do all of this a lot easier by having a tool, in your toolkit. A tool like SocialBee, for instance, which can take you through the entire flow starting with connecting your profiles. In SocialBee, you can connect all of the profiles that you, need starting from the entire meta suite. So Facebook, Instagram, threads, going further into X, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and all of these other good platforms that will allow you to stay relevant on social media.

Anca Pop [00:18:20]:
These are the general ones, but if you're interested in using the niche platforms, you can also connect those to SocialBee with something called universal posting, which is a little more of a semi automated way of posting. So it actually gives you a mobile notification when it's time to post on platforms that don't currently have any scheduling options that are direct. Once you have your profiles connected in SocialBee, you can move on to the second step, which is creating content categories or content pillars or types of content or buckets of content or however you wanna call them. Essentially, this is a way for you to organize your content so that you are always aware of the types of content that you need to create content for in order to stay on top of your social media strategy. So if you have content that's promotional, content that's educational, content that's entertaining, content that's curated from other sources. Now you have a place to organize these into pillars and make it a lot easier for you to balance out that content mix. Speaking about balancing out a content mix, the third thing that you can do in SocialBee is create that content schedule based on your categories. So instead of having to go in and add a specific posting date to every blog post that you wanna schedule on Wednesday, you can just go ahead and schedule the blog post category for Wednesdays at 9.

Anca Pop [00:19:51]:
And that will help you make sure that you're being consistent, that you're not missing a date, that you are saving time and not doing the tedious and repetitive task of having to schedule each individual post because it is a lot easier to just schedule the category and queue up that post in the category itself. But adding the post is not enough, so the next thing that you need to do is publish the post. Right? Once they're published, you'll be able to do 2 different things. 1, reply to comments, to mentions, to DMs, which is something that you should do on a daily basis. And you can do that even, in SocialBee, by using the engage feature, which will allow you to monitor and reply to these comments, mentions, DMs directly in the platform across all of your channels, making it easier for you to to interact with your audience. But, also, you'll be able to track your analytics and export the necessary data in order to make sure that you're working your best content out there, that you are changing and evolving your content according to what your audience needs.
