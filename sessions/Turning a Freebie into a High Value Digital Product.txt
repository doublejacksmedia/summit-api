[00:00:14.040] - Sasha
Hello, everyone. My name is Sasha Hutchison aka, your frugal friend, and I'm very excited today to talk to you about turning a freebie into a high-value digital product. So, if you don't know me, my name is Sasha, and I am a top one person seller over at Etsy. My etsy shop is yourfrugalfriend.etsy.com. I have over 14,000 sells, and I love creating digital products that add value to business owners and also just regular consumers who love to consume digital products.

[00:00:46.990] - Sasha
I've also created courses that help sellers in the digital product space level up their products and marketing strategies. I'm also an Etsy coach who is passionate about helping people just like you make more money with your digital products business. I coach bloggers who want to sell their stuff on Etsy. I coach Etsy people who want to sell stuff on their blog. Digital products are a huge, huge, huge path to making lots of passive income and money for your business.

[00:01:16.060] - Sasha
And also, digital products are a great way to get optins to your email list. People love digital products. Okay, so what are we going to learn about today? Well, we're going to talk about what are typical freebies, how you can turn a freebie into a paid product, and how easy is it to do. So, freebies are usually digital products like printables that you give away for an email optin.

[00:01:42.760] - Sasha
You probably have a ton yourself or you've been told that you have to do these freebies to get email optins, stuff like that. And they can be anything, really. I think a lot of people default to printables because it's simple, but you can do things like ou know ebooks that are with fillable form fills. You can do canva templates, you can do spreadsheets. There's so many things that you can turn into a freebie.

[00:02:08.620] - Sasha
So, how can you turn your freebie into a paid product? You can create an editable template that's like a canva template. You can create fillable forms that would be with fillable form fillups that you make in a program such as like, Adobe DC. Digital planner products, you can make those in tons of platforms. Or you can actually turn existing products to a spreadsheet. I think people, they think spreadsheets are something that can only be used for financial products, but really, you can turn anything into a spreadsheet.

[00:02:34.920] - Sasha
Like, people love to buy grocery list spreadsheets, habit tracker spreadsheets. I mean, it's endless. So, how easy is this to do? Well, retooling your freebie into a high value product is a lot easier than you think. Everything on the market now is so easy to use now.

[00:02:51.710] - Sasha
So, the myth, I need to be tech savvy to be able to create high-value digital products. Well, no, that's not true. All you need is a desire to learn to be successful creating these types of products. When I started creating digital products in 2019 as a side hustle, they were just printables. And I learned how to use Canva in the weekend and I launched my shop and by three months, I had made $100 and had sold like a 100 products.

[00:03:15.630] - Sasha
And I was selling low-value products. But I also wanted to start a blog and put these single-page printable products I was selling in my Etsy shop on my blog and get subscribers. And I was able to do this really quickly and easily, teach myself almost everything. And it was super simple. So, you don't need to be super tech savvy to do this, to create high-value freebies.

[00:03:41.960] - Sasha
Another myth, the programs that you need to create these types of products are too expensive. No, they're not. So creating high-value digital products can be done for free or for a small fee. I did everything for free until I hit 500 sales in my Etsy shop. It was kind of my benchmark to pay for products.

[00:03:57.760] - Sasha
And now, in hindsight, I regret not spending a little bit of money to save myself time making these amazing high-value digital products. Because I was able to scale so much more quickly and create products that people really wanted once I paid for a couple of programs that are super cheap to use.

[00:04:19.010] - Sasha
Okay. So, let's cover first what is an editable template, because I think some people get this confused, but also people use the terms fillable and editable interchangeably. So, if you're thinking about a fillable form or something for like Adobe that you'd use in Adobe Reader, like printable with fillable form fields. That's actually a fillable PDF but people sometimes call editable, I will use the term editable for SEO because that is something that people think of and they're using as a term. But actually, an editable template is something like a Canva template that you create and then you share the template link. And someone can edit that design on their own computer and customize it for their own needs, for whatever they want to do with it. So, how much do these editable programs cost?

[00:05:10.920] - Sasha
Well, Canva is free to use and you can create editable templates on it now. You didn't use to, you had to have Canva pro, but now Canva free is an option. Just know that with Canva, you have to create your own template to share to give us a freebie. Or if you're going to eventually sell it or whatever, you can't use the canned templates in Canva to do this. You have to create your own design, but it's very simple to do.

[00:05:36.410] - Sasha
It's super quick to learn. So that's something to keep in the back of your mind when you're doing these things on Canva. Corjl is another program. It's super popular in like, the wedding space. So, let's say you're a wedding blogger and you want to give away a customizable or editable wedding sign that people can customize because you want to eventually upsell them on like your invitations that you have as a digital product or something.

[00:06:04.030] - Sasha
Well, Corjl is a program that they can go in and the biggest, the biggest thing about Corjl that is a huge selling point for people is they can get a demo link with Corjl to test out the product before they buy it, have a watermark on it, they can demo it, and then they can convert. So, if you're giving that away as a freebie, you may be able to convert people that way because they're able to see how awesome it is and then they can potentially buy like whatever wedding package you have. It does have a much higher cost to using the program. It has tiers like 799 is if you sell one to fifty products a month, and then it goes up in price, and plus they charge you a fee for every template you sell. So, if you're doing it for freebies, you might think about maybe doing a Canva template to start and then Corjl or something, whatever you want to do.

[00:06:53.520] - Sasha
Templett is another editable template program. It's cheaper than Cordial and people use it for the same purposes as Corjl. It's very similar, it just has a different pricing scheme, but it's pretty cheap to start. So, those are things that you can look into to creating an editable template for your freebie and not just giving them like a PDF printable or something. Okay. So, what is a fillable product?

[00:07:17.980] - Sasha
So, a fillable product is a document with syllable form fields or calculated fields. And that would be like a fillable form field. If you don't know what this is, you may have gotten a W nine to fill out or W two, and you type in your information and then you save it and you send it back. Those would be fillable form fields. Other things that you can do with these programs that create fillable form fields is you can have it do drop down to dates, you can do checkboxes, you can allow them to customize the font and the font size, font type, and you can also add calculated fields.

[00:07:57.460] - Sasha
So, the programs that are most popular to do this in is, number one is PDF Escape. It's free to use. The downside to PDF Escape is that it's very laborous and tedious to use. They don't make it easy to use it for free. And you can only do fillable form fields that are text fields and you can do checkboxes and not much else.

[00:08:18.120] - Sasha
You can do a simple checklist in this and it's great for that. But if you want to do anything a little more sophisticated to make your freebie more high-value, you might want to opt for something that is a paid program. So, I'll jump down to Foxit. So, Foxit $79 a year, has similar limitations to PDF escape, but it is a lot easier to use. But yet again, it can't do calculated fills or anything with a lot of pizzazz.

[00:08:43.810] - Sasha
So, then Adobe DC, this is my favorite. It is the gold standard when it comes to creating syllable products and fillable freebies and stuff like that. If you opt for the annual plan, it's $19.99 a month. And then what I did in the beginning, because I am a super cheap and frugal person through and through, I decided to get the seven-day free trial. After I made a bunch of printables, I wanted to make fillable. And then once I got through my seven-day free trial, I'll turn on the subscription for 29.99 a month, make all my fillables with documents, with, like, calculated fields and like customizable font and all that stuff, and then I'll just turn it off.

[00:09:31.260] - Sasha
So, you'd be spending a small amount of money to earn a lot more money, so it's a great investment. And that's what I was saying in the beginning. I spent a lot of time with, like, PDF escape. It was very tedious.

[00:09:43.420] - Sasha
It was so hard to use. And then when I went over to Adobe DC, I was like, oh, my god, I can create ten products for every one product in this program. Same with Foxit. It's a little more tedious, but at least, it's an option if you wanted to create a little bit more polished forms, but not with a lot of functionality.

[00:10:01.760] - Sasha
So, the next, what is a digital planner? If you don't know, a digital planner is a digital version of a traditional paper planner, and it can include hyperlinks. So, these are really great. You can actually market your freebie optin to be used in a digital planner. So, for example, I sell, like, savings trackers in my etsy shop.

[00:10:25.780] - Sasha
I've also given away this little saving star with the balls in it that people can color in, and people will grab that, and they'll upload it into their digital planner, and then they'll color it in with their apple pen on their tablet. And I didn't even market it to do that. And knowing now what I didn't know then is that you can market every single PDF product you have to be uploaded into a digital planner to be used as a digital planner insert. That's the word for it, an insert.

[00:10:58.680] - Sasha
So, definitely, if you feel like you have products like mood trackers or bullet journal inserts, or even, like, recipe templates or anything that you feel like would be used really well on a note annotation app, that's an app like good notes that people use for their digital planner. That's a, it's a note annotation app because you upload your digital planner and you write on top of it. So, it's like a template, you write on top of it. So, if you feel like you have a freebie that you can market that way, that would be a really, really good way to get optins on to your list for subscribers.

[00:11:32.980] - Sasha
And even then, you're not necessarily having to create a digital planner, but you're just marketing it to be used in one. And that in itself is assigning a higher value to your freebie printable. If you have a workbook or something, tell people they can upload it onto their iPad and write onto it in good notes or something. Okay, so let's say you wanted to create your own digital planner products to give away to your audience. Well, you can create them in keynote, and that is a free to use program, but it's only for people who use Mac computers.

[00:12:09.100] - Sasha
All are apple products. So, then there's Adobe InDesign, and that's what I use for my digital planners that I've created. And that's $35.99 a month. And yet again, I turn it on and then I turn it off, and that creates really great hyperlinked products. And Keynote does that too.

[00:12:26.920] - Sasha
Keynote is like the slide. It's a slide version of, it's a slide program, like PowerPoint in Microsoft products. It's the same thing. You can also create these digital planners in Microsoft too, so just know that. But I like Adobe InDesign because you can design everything in there, and you can also make it look really sharp and it looks really good.

[00:12:57.270] - Sasha
Same thing with Keynote. You can do that too, but you have to be someone who has a Mac or Apple product. So, Canva is another thing I think people overlook for creating digital planners, too. You can actually assign hyperlinks in Canva. The only limitation to Canva is that you can only do like 100 pages, I think.

[00:13:19.780] - Sasha
And so, if you're creating just like a simple notepad or workbook or something, think about using Canva to create your digital planner, or like, turning your workbook into a digital planner with hyperlinks. Because that's all a digital planner is, just a document hyperlinks that people can click on. And so, think about using Canva to create your digital planners. And it's a great way to retool your freebie into a product that can be used within the digital planner niche, because that is definitely a niche of people.

[00:13:58.090] - Sasha
Okay. So, spreadsheets, so spreadsheets are another option. And people are more familiar with spreadsheets than ever. So, Google Sheets, I feel like, has really opened up the opportunity to sell spreadsheets or give them away to freebies to people. Because all people need to use a spreadsheet nowadays, is a Google, a Gmail account. Most people have a Gmail email, and then they can use Google Sheets, and it can be used on a PC or a Mac.

[00:14:28.500] - Sasha
And that's great because sometimes I've noticed when I sell spreadsheets or I give them away, that people who try to use it on like, numbers, which you see there is an option for spreadsheets that has a limitation of what it can see with graphs. So, then you would just tell that user who has a Mac, like, just download this into your Gmail account and then open it in Google sheets and then use it. And they love that. They're like, wow, I didn't even know I could do that. And so if you wanted to make a spreadsheet, you can make one for free in Google Sheets.

[00:14:58.930] - Sasha
The only thing is it doesn't have as many bells and whistles and it won't look as pretty is something that you would create in Microsoft Excel. And Microsoft Excel now is so cheap, 9.99 a month. For personal use, super cheap. I use it, obviously, for my business, but it just creates these beautiful spreadsheets with lots of functionality. And like I said earlier in the presentation, you can turn anything, any kind of freebie into a higher-value product by turning it into a spreadsheet like that.

[00:15:29.490] - Sasha
Wedding planner, habit tracker, I've seen people do like grocery list, master cleaning lists, they've done recipe books. I mean, it's incredible what you can do with spreadsheets now. And people are more comfortable than ever using them. And it's a great way to get optins or to turn your optins into higher value products or whatever you want to do with it.

[00:15:53.790] - Sasha
But definitely, consider looking into turning a product you have that you didn't think you could turn into a spreadsheet into a spreadsheet because people love it. Because the spreadsheet, especially on Google Sheets, it can live in the cloud, and so they can access it from anywhere. Like, I look on my phone, at my budget, I have on my Google Sheets account. So, you can really create a freebie that people, high-value freebie that people use everywhere they go on their phone, at home. And then they're constantly seeing the thing that you created and becoming like a huge, raving fan of yours because of spreadsheets. All right. So, let's dive in.

[00:16:32.580] - Sasha
So, I'm going to give you three tips for creating high value digital products. Tip number one, decide which products that you already have created that you can make more valuable. All right, so have you created these? Printable planners, a printable guide of some kind, maybe some kind of keepsake printable, printable binder product, or ebooks, or workbooks.

[00:17:00.410] - Sasha
All of these can be made more valuable. So, with your principal planner, you can turn it into a digital planner, or you can put fillable form fields on it and make it something that people can type into and save in the cloud. You can also turn your principal guide into a higher-value product by maybe making it a canva template that your audience can use to make for their, to customize for their own business. And so that's a great thing you can do with that. So, keepsake printables so, like on handprint or footprint crafts or something like that, where you print it out and people can put their handprints on.

[00:17:35.170] - Sasha
You can put a fillable form filled on that for people to type in, like to grandpa from Timmy. And so that's another thing you do with keepsake printables. Printable binder products, this would be like in case of emergency binder products which are super popular right now. Putting fillable form fields in that makes it such a high-value product. People want to buy it because you know, if you want to be able to read your own handwriting or someone else's handwriting in the case of emergency, you definitely want to have it typed out and not handwritten.

[00:18:08.460] - Sasha
I have terrible handwriting, so when I use it in case of emergency binder, I'm definitely using one with fillable form fields, so people can read my handwriting. And that's definitely a higher-value product. If you give away maybe like an emergency contact list, it could be a one-page printable. And that could be like great for a mom blog or something to give for a babysitter or like an emergency information form for a pet sitter. If you add fillable form fields onto that then people are going to, they're going to want to grab it, they're going to want it, they're going to become an email subscriber for you. So, then we have ebooks or workbooks.

[00:18:45.880] - Sasha
These are great for people who are like coaches or if you are someone that has a food blog and you give people customizable recipe books. Then you can give them a Canva template or something or even like create a Corjl template with it, so they can create like a really highly valued keepsake family recipe book or something. So, you can do so much with your basic freebie printable products or something by turning them into higher-value products using different programs. All right.

[00:19:16.540] - Sasha
Tip number two, know the subscriber you are serving and what kind of program they would feel comfortable using. This is so important. So, questions to ask yourself do my potential subscribers want a high-value product?

[00:19:32.100] - Sasha
So, you may have something like just like a, a keto cheat sheet that's just a printable that they put out on their fridge or food that they can buy, and that they can buy the grocery store that meets their dietary needs. Well, I don't know necessarily if they need a high-value product for that. Would they want a canva template? Does that make sense for this type of freebie optin? Maybe you can add some fillable lines on the end, they can type in and then print it out.

[00:20:01.350] - Sasha
But you have to think about the person you're serving, the person you're trying to get optin and what their needs are. And if you're creating more work for them and if they are assigning the perception of having to do work when they get their optin to get the value from it. So, the number two, how much buying will I have to get from my subscribers to opt in for the high value product? And this is really important depending on the audience that you are serving. So, let's say that you are a business to consumer person serving that audience. So, for example, I am a person who sells Etsy products.

[00:20:43.150] - Sasha
My etsy shop. I serve many, many niches in my shop. It's kind of an emporium at this poin. But for someone who wants to buy, you know like a mom bucks or reward cards, you know little reward coupons for their kid, if I was to sell that as a Canva template, I probably have to get a lot of buying from that customer to buy it because they're going, what's Canva? Do I have to do all this work to get this product to be usable for my situation, for my intended uses. But if I was selling a workbook to a person who is another business owner, they probably are familiar with Canva and they feel comfortable buying that because they understand, I'm going to take this, I'm going to transform it, and I'm going to sell it or do whatever I want with that.

[00:21:30.840] - Sasha
So, you have to understand your audience and what they're buying is for the, for the freebie, or whatever you're trying to give them. So then, number three, well, the idea of getting this high-value product excite them. So, when I see a freebie that's just a picture of you know basic workbook, I'm like, I don't really care. It's not really exciting to me. What transformation is it going to give me?

[00:21:56.770] - Sasha
It's going to be something I can just pop up on my computer and type into and save with fillable form fields. I remember I was gifted by another business owner once. She was wanting to thank me for something, and she gave me this like 200 page planner. And I was like, wow, this is super exciting to get. It was like a content planner, but I noticed that it was just like twelve months printed out, so that's twelve pages, and then 52 weeks printed out with hardly any lines.

[00:22:29.250] - Sasha
And then, you get the point. It was just all these pages printed out of the same thing. And after I got it, I was way less excited about it because it didn't really provide me any extra value. It wasn't high value to me, and it didn't give me like, fillable form fields with like some stuff filled in for me to get me started thinking about my content creation. It was just so basic, wasn't exciting.

[00:22:53.550] - Sasha
So, definitely, think about how to excite them about your high-value products. All right, tip number three. You can sell your high-value product or upsell other products. And I think that this is a trap that a lot of bloggers get into. I know this because I coached them and they will say, I have all these freebies and I'm not getting subscribers.

[00:23:17.340] - Sasha
And I say to them, okay, well, have you thought about selling your freebie, you know? Because they'll usually have an Etsy shop and they're like, no, I never thought of selling my freebie. Well, I sell so many of the freebies, I give away on my blog, and I sell them 100 to one of how much I actually give them away on my Etsy shop. So, this is a freebie I gave away that's high value.

[00:23:42.060] - Sasha
And you have to think about you know exactly like, who am I serving, what entices them, what's going to make them excited. And so for this freebie, it's a freebie optin guide, 30 fillable, printable product ideas to sell. I got 767 subscribers in 90 days, and I made $632 in additional sales of Canva templates. It was twelve Canva templates to make fillable. And it's a complimentary product because I'm giving you all these keyword ideas.

[00:24:14.530] - Sasha
I do extensive SEO keyword research is why I've been so successful with my Etsy shop. And I just know SEO really well for selling things and creating things that have value. And I give people this list. It was free to optin, tons of subscribers, and I sold this complimentary product for people to make fillable.

[00:24:34.530] - Sasha
And then also I upsell my fillable PDF course to go along with it. And I understood how this was a super valuable freebie opt in. I know my audience. I also had affiliates promote this to their list because they know the value of fillable products.

[00:24:52.060] - Sasha
And then I promoted that complimentary products make more money. So, don't discount being able to sell your freebies, your high-value freebies as actual profitable products. I think that people overlook doing that and try doing that. Think about ways you can sell your freebie or sell complementary products to that freebie that adds a ton of value to your potential subscriber. All right. So, get more optins.

[00:25:21.580] - Sasha
Do market research to see what products you have created that you can make higher value. So, just write this information down, you know, see, brainstorm, think about what do I have that can turn into maybe a spreadsheet or a Canva template or whatever. So, research high-value opted ideas to get more subscribers. So, maybe see what other people are doing. See what other bloggers in your niche are doing to get what high-value optins are they doing?

[00:25:48.940] - Sasha
Is there something similar that you can do with your own existing freebies? And then also sell a complimentary product with your optin, or sell your optin online, such as on Etsy. So, like I said earlier, I sell every single optin I have as a product in my Etsy shop. And sometimes people don't want to give away that email address for a freebie.

[00:26:08.880] - Sasha
Sometimes they just want to give you their money. So, definitely, think of different ways you can use your freebie to make money, because you took time making that. So, you need to get something in return. And people want these high-value optins. All right, so what's my high-value product strategy?

[00:26:24.630] - Sasha
And it's to create fillable products through and through. Fillable products are extremely popular. Why? Because people are comfortable with these products. Almost everyone has Adobe Reader on their computer, or they can easily download it for free.

[00:26:38.800] - Sasha
This is on a Mac or on a PC. You can add fillable form fields to transform simple products. So, you can turn a simple budget, printable, one-page printable into a document with calculated fields that give people the power of spreadsheets at their fingertips. They can save it, they can put it in the cloud. You can do so much.

[00:26:58.330] - Sasha
You can create customizable bingo games. You can create extremely high-value checklists, workbooks, I mean, there's so much that you can do. It's what I did to blow away the competition on Etsy and make over 14,000 sales and become a top 1% seller. That's all I did is I added fillable form fields to basic products and with calculated fields and I destroyed the competition.

[00:27:24.460] - Sasha
It's totally worth it. Alright. So, I have a course on how to learn how to make fillable PDFs in one weekend. So, learn how to make fillable PDF documents easily and quickly. I go through a series of steps. So the beginner step would be to create just a basic menu planner.

[00:27:44.860] - Sasha
Because creating that high-value product with a menu planner is something people want to type it in. They share it with someone via email or in the cloud, or they print it out and fill in the fridge. People love that. And then also I teach you how to make simple, calculated filled on a carb counter. So, if you're in the fitness weight loss niche or whatever, you can actually create these calculated fields for carb counters.

[00:28:06.210] - Sasha
And it's super awesome. It's super fun to do. And then I take you up to creating a paycheck budget and that's with more complex, just calculate fields, tying things together. You get a really good deep dive of everything you can do with Adobe DC. And also, then I teach you how to make a customizable game because customizable games are huge and super popular right now.

[00:28:30.040] - Sasha
People love being able to customize games for like bachelorette parties. You know, like, who knows the birthday girl best, they can type in their own questions. People love that stuff. And I teach you how to do this with a free trial of Adobe DC.

[00:28:42.930] - Sasha
You can do it in one week. And then, like I said before, you can turn on subscription, turn more fillables, your printable products into fillable products, and then turn off the subscription, and just start creating higher value products. This is my favorite way to do it. Takes the least amount of tech. It's super fun to do.

[00:29:01.690] - Sasha
I've been doing it for years now and I've made a lot of money doing it. And I've gotten a lot of freebie options because of it. All right, so let's keep in touch, and I want to thank you for watching this presentation. I hope you learned some stuff. And definitely, reach out to me.
