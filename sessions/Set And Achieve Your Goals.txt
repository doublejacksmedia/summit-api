Hey, and welcome to today's presentation on how to set and achieve your goals. Here's what you're going to learn today. You're going to learn what success actually is and you're going to learn how to set achievable goals. My goal is that you won't leave here today knowing exactly how to set and achieve goals that support your unique vision of success. Now, before we start, please get out a piece of paper and a pen because we are going to work as we go and feel free to screenshot any of these slides.

[00:00:41.570] - Erin
If I'm moving too fast. I'm going to have a lot of stuff going on here today and I want you to get the most out of this presentation. So, screenshot away if that you know helps you out and get out the paper and pen so that you can jot down notes as we go. Now I'm Erin Flynn, if we haven't met before. And I believe that business can be simple and still successful, I've been running my own business since 2012, so coming up on ten years here, so pretty long time in the online world.

[00:01:10.980] - Erin
I'm a web designer and an educator. I mostly teach now.

[00:01:14.150] - Erin
I'm the founder of Successfully Simple, which is a website where you can go and learn how to simplify your business. I'm queen of the two hour work day, sometimes even less actually, very often, even less, now that I have a kid. And if you would like to connect with me outside of this, you can find me at Successfully Simple on Instagram or Erin Three Flynn on Twitter. So, enough about me. Let's get started.

[00:01:40.590] - Erin
What is success anyway?

[00:01:45.190] - Erin
All of our lives, we are told by others what success is. Our parents tell us to be successful by getting good grades, going to College and then getting a good job. Society tells us that success looks like a white picket fence and two and a half kids. The online entrepreneur world tells that success looks like six. No way.

[00:02:04.320] - Erin
Seven figures, a private jet and luxury vacations. On the surface, all of these things are really great, but in reality, they may not be what we want at all. Sorry, mom and dad, but doing well on standardized tests and even going to college doesn't necessarily lead to getting a good job. And even if it does, a regular eight to five isn't for everyone. I know that I'm not the only one who made myself miserable throughout high school and college obsessing over getting A's only to graduate, get a job, and discover that I hated working for someone else.

[00:02:39.730] - Erin
The whole white picket fence thing is great for some, but not for all of us. Maybe you want a penthouse condo, and instead of human babies, you want fur babies or plant babies or no babies at all. There's nothing wrong with that. And they're ridiculously extravagant lifestyle portrayed by online entrepreneurs. Besides the fact it's mostly just for show and fake to get you to buy whatever expensive program they're selling.

[00:03:03.100] - Erin
The focus on making money above all else, can lead to severe burnout and never feeling fulfilled. Why? Because there will always be the potential for more. You'll never be doing enough. Now, I do want to make it really clear that if you want any of the standard markers of success, that is 100%.

[00:03:23.860] - Erin
Okay. I'm pretty close to the white picket fence thing myself. But if the standard doesn't make you happy, then that is not what success is for you, and that's not what you should be chasing. Now, the problem when we don't meet the so called standard of success, whether it's making a certain amount of money or getting married by a certain age or even looking a certain way, we feel as if we have failed and we continue to feel that way unless we define our own unique vision of success.

[00:03:54.670] - Erin
If you are constantly trying to reach what other people consider success, you will never feel successful. There will always be something that someone thinks you should do better, or instead you have lost before you even started.

[00:04:10.190] - Erin
Success is what makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and it doesn't matter if it looks impressive to others. It doesn't matter if it makes your parents happy. Success is personal, and it looks different to all of us. When we define success for ourselves, we are able to set aside the standard and create our own path to feeling fulfilled and successful. It no longer matters what internet gurus are telling us how much money we need to make to be happy, because we have discovered our own numbers that support the life we truly want.

[00:04:39.090] - Erin
It no longer matters that we don't have a traditional eight to five because we're confident in the business that we've created. No one else's standard of success matters because we know what success means to us. By redefining success, we are taking control of our businesses and our lives instead of feeling like we're feeling for not living up to what someone else cares about. We're able to feel fulfilled and happy. Success isn't what others think of you.

[00:05:03.450] - Erin
It's what you think of yourself. So I want you to take action. What does success mean to you? I've got some questions for you to think about. Question number one, what did your parents tell you about success?

[00:05:18.520] - Erin
Do you feel as if their vision of success is right for you? Why or why not? Question two, what messages about success is society telling you? Do you feel as if this vision of success is right for you?

[00:05:31.710] - Erin
Why or why not? Question three, what are online entrepreneurs telling you about success? Do you feel as if their vision of success is right for you? Why or why not?

[00:05:43.250] - Erin
Having considered what others considered successful summarize what you confidently feel success is and isn't for you. Going to pause here for a second. Feel free to take a screenshot, dot down some notes. And if you feel comfortable, share in the chat, have you figured out what success means to you and if so, what does it look like?

[00:06:01.780] - Erin
You just give us a little sentence about it. I'm going to pause here real quick. Let you take some time to think about this.

[00:06:17.550] - Erin
Okay, now let's talk about how to set achievable goals. Now that we know what our own visions of success look like, it's time to create goals that will get us there. It's important to understand that goals are not the same as dreams. A dream is just an idea, something floating around in our imagination that we would love to have. A goal is something achievable because we are going to make a plan to get there.

[00:06:43.830] - Erin
Now that said, you also have to understand that no one wakes up one day with the goal to going Mount Everest, packs a bag, books a flight and calls that planning. You don't go from zero to dream that easily. Instead, there are months, if not years of preparation, smaller hikes, learning about equipment, testing gear and freezing weather, and lots and lots of body conditioning. Likewise, we can't wake up one day with the idea that we're going to earn $250,000 in the next month without first setting the proper foundations for success.

[00:07:16.950] - Erin
We're going to talk about smart goals because not all goals are created equal. In fact, some goals are worthless because you can't track them and you never know when you reach them. These vague goals must be avoided at all costs. Instead, we want to establish smart goals, and you've probably heard of these before. They're you know all over the place.

[00:07:38.410] - Erin
The first reference that I can find goes back to Peter Drucker in 19 55, but this idea has been shared and adapted throughout the years. But this is really important because they are so key to creating achievable goals. Smart is an acronym that stands for Specific Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time bound. And we're going to go into each of these. So, specific is the first letter in the acronym and you have to be specific about what it is you're trying to accomplish. If you're not, it's going to be hard, if not impossible, to accomplish your goal.

[00:08:17.110] - Erin
One of the best ways to be sure your goal is specific is by asking the six Ws. Now you might want to screenshot this one because there's kind of a lot on this slide, but to make sure that your goal is specific, you will ask yourself these questions, who is needed? Is it just you or will others be involved? What do I want to do? What exactly are you trying to accomplish?

[00:08:42.690] - Erin
Where does it happen now? This may not be necessary for all goals, but if there's a specific location, it needs to be written down. And online, this could even be someplace like Instagram or Facebook or TikTok or wherever. When does it happen. Each goal needs a time limit.

[00:08:59.670] - Erin
Why is it important? What does this goal mean to you? Why are you doing it? And by the way, because some internet guru told you to do it is not a good reason. Which requirements are involved? Do you need to learn a new skill or hire someone?

[00:09:15.710] - Erin
Are there legal requirements or any additional resources that are needed going through all of these questions will ensure that each goal you set is really specific.

[00:09:27.070] - Erin
Alright, the next one is M for measurable. Goals have to be measurable. Otherwise, how will you know when you've reached them? How will you know you're on the right track? When your goals are measurable, they help you stay focused and motivated. To make sure your goal is measurable, you should be able to answer how much or how many as well as how you will know when you've reached it. So, for example, how many clients, how much revenue? Right.

[00:09:55.590] - Erin
The A is for achievable. Goals should stretch you, but not be impossible. Hiking Mount Everest this coming weekend, for example, is going to be impossible for pretty much everybody. Hiking a ten mile trail when you've previously only done a five mile might be a bit of a stretch, but it's likely achievable. So, when setting your goals, ask yourself, how can you accomplish this goal and how realistic is it based on where you are now? Another example of this might be if you're making $50,000 a year, and you want to make 100,000 or you want to make $500,000, that's a really big jump. But making 100,000 could be your next step on your way to $500,000.

[00:10:34.470] - Erin
The R is for relevant.

[00:10:38.850] - Erin
Why does this goal matter to you? Does it take you closer to your vision of success? And if it doesn't? If it doesn't lead you on that path, it is not relevant. But if it does, this is a relevant goal that you are setting towards what your vision of success looks like.

[00:10:55.030] - Erin
It will help keep you motivated.

[00:10:59.790] - Erin
So, to determine if your goal is relevant, you can ask yourself these questions. Does this support my vision of success? If not, don't do it. Is this the right time to work on this goal? Sometimes goals are really great, but the timing can be really off.

[00:11:16.860] - Erin
So, for example, if you have a goal to launch a new service, but you're heading off on a family vacation, it might not be the right time. Maybe you want to wait until you get back. Am I the right person to work on this goal? Some goals are better left to others. Maybe you want a new website design.

[00:11:34.670] - Erin
That's part of you know your vision of success. But you know nothing about making a website. In that case, it might be better to hire someone else. So, make sure your goals are relevant. Sometimes we set goals based on what we see others doing, but in reality you're relevant to us.

[00:11:52.870] - Erin
And our visions of success.

[00:11:56.730] - Erin
Alright, the T is for time bound. Goals needed the time limit, will be hard to stay motivated and get them done. Having a time limit on your goals ensures that they remain a priority and they don't get pushed aside by other things. For example, if you have a goal of getting three new clients by the end of the quarter, that's going to motivate you to do the steps, take the actions that you need to get those clients.

[00:12:22.200] - Erin
If, on the other hand, you just have three new clients sometime, then you're not going to be very likely to be motivated to achieve that goal and it's going to get pushed to the back. Most of us make goals that are not smart and therefore we don't achieve them. They're just way too vague. Most of us will make a goal at something like get more clients. But that is not a good goal because it's lacking many major components of being smart.

[00:12:53.670] - Erin
So, why is that a really bad goal? Well, I kind of just mentioned it. Let's go into why. First of all, it's not very specific. More clients could really mean just about anything, any number at any time you know gotten by anyone.

[00:13:08.080] - Erin
It's also not measurable. What does more mean? Does it mean one? Does it mean twelve? You will not be able to know when this goal is achieved because it's not you know  specific enough. Is it achievable?

[00:13:22.410] - Erin
Not really, because we don't know what more means and we don't know where we're starting from. Now it probably is relevant, at least somewhat. No one wants clients for no reason, but we're lacking a big why on this goal, why do we need more clients? Is it so that we can you know make enough money to go on family vacation? And it's definitely not time bound because no time was set.

[00:13:45.790] - Erin
More clients could happen today or it could happen 20 years from now. So, how can we make this goal achievable? I find the easiest way to create a smart goal out of a vague goal, is by writing it out in a full sentence. That means a goal to get more clients becomes I want to get three clients in the next 30 days so that I can take two months off this summer. See how that works?

[00:14:15.370] - Erin
This works because the goal is specific. We say exactly what we want. It's measurable. Three clients will know when we've reached it. It's achievable, but you can't tell here.

[00:14:24.810] - Erin
This is you know kind of based on past experience. Okay, we could get three clients. That makes sense. Maybe ten doesn't make sense in that time frame, but three seems doable. It's relevant. The why is that.

[00:14:36.720] - Erin
We can take time off without needing to work, which is supporting our vision of success. And it's time bound. We're going to do it in the next 30 days. It's easy to see how setting goals this way helps us stay motivated and focused on what we're trying to accomplish. If you run all of your goals through the smart filter, you'll be sure to choose good ones because you'll know that they support your success.

[00:15:02.290] - Erin
So, I want you to take action and start using the smart filter on all of your goals. Run them through. Are they smart? Are they too big? If in doubt, write them out as a question. Now I would love it.

[00:15:15.140] - Erin
If in the chat, you would share a smart goal with me that you have for your business that supports your vision of success. I'm going to give you a little pause. So, you have time to do that.

[00:15:36.570] - Erin
Okay, so here's what you learned today. You learned what success actually is and you learned how to set achievable goals. Success is what is important to you. Your unique vision of success, not what is set by other people.
