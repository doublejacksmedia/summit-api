Aisha Preece [00:00:12]:
Hello, everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming to my presentation, how to overcome procrastination and self doubt with your blog. My name is Aisha Preece, and I just want to apologize in advance if I sound stuffy. I've got a bit of a flu, a cold, so you might hear a bit of a bit of, coughing, but we'll we'll we'll we'll roll with it. Okay.

Aisha Preece [00:00:34]:
So welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Your time is so valuable. Let's get to it. So let me just quickly explain who I am because many of you may not know. You might be new to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I've I've, presented on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit of the last 3 years, and this is my 4th year.

Aisha Preece [00:00:51]:
It's a truly a privilege and an honor. I love Liz's summit. She adds value to so many of you. So thank you for having me, Liz. Thank you all for being here. So for those that don't know me, unfortunately, in October 2019, my best friend passed away suddenly. And it was a real wake up call for me because she was so young, so beautiful, so talented. And I decided that, you know, life's too short as we all have these realizations.

Aisha Preece [00:01:17]:
And I decided to change chase my dream of making an actual income from blogging. Because everyone talks about, I'm gonna be a blogger. I'm gonna be a blogger. But actually, can I actually earn from this blog? And I wanted to make that into a reality. But the truth is, and I know many of you will face this, it took me ages to have a breakthrough. You know, I went through the pain of I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm I'm taking all this action. I'm not taking action.

Aisha Preece [00:01:41]:
I'm procrastinating, but even the action I'm taking, I don't know if it's right. And it took me a lifetime and a half to have a breakthrough, but I did have a breakthrough. And I'll share in a moment how you can have a breakthrough. And once I had that breakthrough, I qualified for Mediavine, the lucrative advertising network, and I scaled my my, traffic on my my first blog to over 200,000 pages a month. So that's 2 of 2 of visitors. That's quite a lot. And, on top after that, I had a momentum, and I just decided to set up, so, 5 5 additional blogs, so 6 in total. And I hired a team.

Aisha Preece [00:02:18]:
I I I scaled, and my income grew to a point where it was more than my wildest dreams. So I grew I didn't grow up with much money. And so to me, it was a total different lifestyle change. Obviously, I didn't wanna get into lifestyle inflation, but I had more money than I ever ever dreamed of, and it was so, so exhilarating. And, you know, when you know, we think that the high is gonna be high forever. Right? But, unfortunately, I hit a slump after growing and saving and all this income and, you know, getting the success of blogging, getting interviewed on multiple podcasts. I hit a slump because in life, what goes up will go down, will go what goes down will come up. Life is cyclical.

Aisha Preece [00:02:57]:
Okay? And, unfortunately, as some of you will will know, the Google you know, there were Google updates that hit my site and that really knocked my confidence. And, unfortunately, someone who I really trusted, there was a friend in the blogging industry who also copied my courses. That was really tough on me. I lost my confidence, and I started to feel imposter syndrome again. I know I felt it at the beginning. I overcame it, and then I felt it again. And I just had no energy and motivation, to work on my blogs, and they began to drop. Quite honestly, I wanted to give up, and I thought that maybe blogging wasn't for me.

Aisha Preece [00:03:32]:
I wasn't cut out for it. And I just thought I don't deserve to teach. I I don't I'm not I'm not worthy of it. Anyway, after a full year of this going through going going through this, I got my head back into the right place, thankfully. And I'm gonna share a few actionable strategies that have really helped me, get my head right so I could continue blogging. And so, also, you can continue blogging too. Now having a strong mindset, we're gonna need it in many parts of our life, but when we're talking about blogging, you're gonna need it especially at the beginning. Because there's no university of blogging.

Aisha Preece [00:04:09]:
Right? You wanna study law, you go to a law school. You wanna study medicine, there's a guide, there's a path. There is a university of blogging, so it's very confusing and overwhelming. And this is when your mind needs to be the strongest. Number 2 is when things go right and then suddenly they go wrong, that's when you also need a strong mindset to get you through the bad times, to get you through the bad times, to go through the good times again. And so transforming my mindset has changed my life and allowed me to blog now for many, many years and, hopefully, for many years more. And, hopefully, it's gonna change yours too. Now if I keep looking right, it's kind of looking at the watch.

Aisha Preece [00:04:44]:
I don't wanna waste your time. I wanna make sure that this presentation is succinct and, it's in the time, you know, within the time duration. So quickly before I begin, I know that there's so many things that take up your time 24 hours a day. For one moment, I'm gonna ask you just put your phone, turn it around, get dedicate yourself. You got 5, 25 minutes left. Give yourself the gift of 25 minutes of just learning. Okay? Don't get distracted. Put your phone away.

Aisha Preece [00:05:12]:
Tell yourself, I'm gonna give myself 25 minutes a day to focus and really get my head right. You've got have you done that yet? Put your phone away, turn it around, put it on mute. Done? Cool. Let's move on. Now first things first, I want you to ask yourself, because you're at this Blogger Breakthrough Summit, what is the real reason your blog is not successful? What is the real reason that you're here today? Because I actually never understood the importance of a strong well trained mindset. I used to think, like, it was 0, like, eat, pray, love. Like, I didn't have time. I was like, give me the strategy.

Aisha Preece [00:05:44]:
Give me the strategy. I wanna know. Tell me what to do. I was like, I don't have time to sit around and journal and think of my thoughts. I don't have that luxury because time equals money. And that genuinely is the thought the the thought process I had before I changed the way I think. Because but here's the reality. Your blogging isn't successful generally due to two reasons.

Aisha Preece [00:06:08]:
1, you don't have the right strategy, and you'll learn that strategy. I know there's so many courses and trainings in this Blogger Breakthrough Summit that teaches you strategy. And I've taught strategy the last 3 years in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but I realized often we could have all the strategy on the course in the world, but we don't implement. Why? Because of our mindset. We think, oh, I don't have time. I procrastinate. I don't have motivation. I have impostor syndrome, and that's where the execution, the lack of execution comes in.

Aisha Preece [00:06:39]:
People think it's because of strategy and not the right strategy. You I'm sure many of you have bought expensive courses, but they haven't been implemented. Why? Because of your mind. I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think my writing's good enough. No one's gonna read my blog. I'm not getting the results, so this must mean I'm a failure. Execution is a hugely overlooked reason as to why your blog isn't succeeding.

Aisha Preece [00:07:00]:
And I'm saying this as somebody that has been blogging for a long time that runs 6 blogs. Okay? Now, unfortunately, we don't understand the cost of a of a weak mindset of not working on our mind. We say, I have time, I have money. I have time, I have money to work on my mind. If you do not, if you have all the strategy in the world, it won't make a difference if you second guess yourself. Oh, should I write this or should I write that? Should I do this strategy? Should I do that strategy? If you don't have any time or energy to work on your blog, that's all also to do with mindset. That's also to do with how you manage your mind. If you just don't have the motivation, oh, I don't feel like doing it.

Aisha Preece [00:07:37]:
You know, you could have the best strategy in the world, but if you don't feel like implementing it, nothing will happen. You could spend days working on one blog, trying to perfect it, overanalyzing, getting overwhelmed. Again, this has to do with mindset. This has nothing to do with strategy. And, also, a huge thing I know, bloggers, beginner, advanced, meet in, you know, intermediate, all of us face this feeling of comparisonitis. There's always someone out there who seems to be better than you, Okay? Who is doing better than you? And that stops us in our tracks. We're like, why do I even bother when everything I do is just not good enough? Okay? So if we didn't have any of this, then we will be able to be so much further with our blogs, and our blogs will be able to succeed. Right? Now I just wanna make sure the sound is on.

Aisha Preece [00:08:23]:
Okay? Yeah. The sound's on. Alright. So now if we move on to the next slide So the real reason so here's the thing. Right? The thoughts that we have in our mind become our actions, and so the thoughts you have are gonna actually change your life. And you've probably heard this again and again that sometimes we need reminders. Right? Like, you're gonna be going through so many courses and trainings today and tomorrow and on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but allow one of them to be about how to implement and execute with your mind. Okay? How can you have better, more productive, empowering thoughts? How can you have that? You train your mind.

Aisha Preece [00:09:06]:
You know, when we wanna we wanna lose weight, we wanna get 6 packs, we wanna go have abs, we go to the gym, we get a personal trainer. So why don't you get a personal trainer for your mind? Why don't we get training to improve the health of our minds? And I watched a documentary on f 1, Formula 1, and a lot of them, a lot of professional sports sportsmen and sportswomen, they have personal trainers for the mind because they understand how important they could have all the stress in the world physically, but mentally, if you're blocked, you will not get anywhere. Okay? So that's what I'm gonna teach you today. So let's talk about procrastination. So today, we're gonna talk about procrastination and self doubt. Now what are you gonna do if you feel like you're procrastinating? Again, let me just check the time to see how much time we have. Okay? So yeah. Okay.

Aisha Preece [00:09:53]:
So I'm just 10 minutes in. So first of all, let's just say you're procrastinating today. You're like, right. I'm procrastinating. I'm just taking so long. I want you to write down on your little notepad now. Why are you why are you procrastinating? There's a root reason, and we may not realize what it is. Is it that the thing that you're trying to do is actually really tough and you don't know how to do it? Because if that's the problem, then strategy will help you.

Aisha Preece [00:10:17]:
Like, it's it's the fact that it scares you and it overwhelms you because you're like, man, I don't know how to do this. It's too tough. That is what is procrastinating you. Okay. We've got ran to got to the root issue. Isn't you procrastinating because you think, man, I should do this, but, actually, I don't really wanna do it? Are you procrastinating because you're so worried that, oh, man, if I try this, if I feel a little dumb. So I I give the example of my YouTube channel. Right? I have procrastinated my YouTube channel from the beginning of time.

Aisha Preece [00:10:48]:
I run 6 blogs, social media channels, email marketing, email list for all of them. But the one thing I keep on procrastinating is my YouTube channel. Even though I know that it would you know, I think it would do well. I could help support my audience in a in a more long form content way. But I realized I was procrastinating, 1, because I didn't have the skill, like, the video editing skills. Number 2, I was procrastinating because I felt like I ought to have a YouTube channel, but, actually, the other things that I enjoyed and were bringing me more value were my Instagram, my email list, my actual blogs. And so write down what is the reason you're procrastinating. Let's get to the bottom of it.

Aisha Preece [00:11:27]:
You know, write it down. Number 2, here's a reality you may not wanna hear. I don't like to hear this reality. And someone told me this, and they said, if you procrastinate, it means that it's not as important as you think it is, and you are prioritizing something else that's more important. Because if you really wanted to make time, you would. I said, if you really wanted to make time, you would. And so for me, I had to ask myself, if I'm procrastinating my YouTube channel to work on my blogs, am I okay with that choice? If you're procrastinating something because you're on social media, because you're making time to go for trips with your friends, you're you're or you're making time for other things, if it's a conscious choice and you think that thing is more valuable, okay. Make peace with it.

Aisha Preece [00:12:16]:
But often, we are procrastinating mindlessly, not realizing that we are prioritizing other people, other things that don't fulfill our needs. Okay? And so are you okay with that? Are you okay with the fact that you are procrastinating on your goal because and you you can audit your time today. What have I done this whole day today? And instead of the thing that you wanna do, have you got on Instagram? Have you watched Netflix? Are you okay in 5, 10 years knowing you didn't achieve your goal with the fact that you decided to watch Netflix and go on on Instagram? Are you okay with that? And if you're okay with that, make peace with it. If you're not okay with it, it means that clearly Netflix and Instagram and social media are more important to you. And if so, why? Why are you making your boss more important than your personal goals? Why are you making other things more important? So the what is more important, if you truly think that thing you're procrastinating is a goal of yours, what is more important than that, and why is it more important? Ask yourself that because I had to ask myself, and I was really shocked by the answer. And number 3 is, let's just say you decided, alright. I've got I've got a mind mind flash. You know? News flash, I've decided that I don't wanna watch I'm not gonna watch Netflix every single night.

Aisha Preece [00:13:31]:
I'm gonna doomscroll. I'm gonna make I'm gonna make time. Cool. Okay. Let's let's go with that momentum and say, alright. The thing that you want to work on, don't be afraid to minimize the goal because I find I have too many goals and eventually end up getting nothing done. If you have 5, whittle it down to 2. If you have 2, whittle it down to 1.

Aisha Preece [00:13:54]:
Less is better when it comes to trying to execute because it prevents overwhelm. And then if you decide, okay. This is the goal I want. Break it down. Okay. I wanna get $2,000 for my blog. Okay. How is that gonna happen? I need to increase the traffic, and I need to monetize the traffic.

Aisha Preece [00:14:12]:
Okay. Step 1, how do I increase the traffic? What strategy? Am I gonna use Pinterest? Am I gonna use Google? Am I gonna use it? What are the strategies you're gonna use to increase traffic? Break it down further. Oh, I'm gonna use, Pinterest. Okay. What are the things I need to do to to ensure ensure that Pinterest gets traffic? Step 1, I need to write the blog post. Step 2, I need to create pin no. Step 1, I need to find you keyword research. Then I need to write the blog post, then I need to create pins.

Aisha Preece [00:14:40]:
See these break it down break it down. Okay. You broke it down. Now you've got the what, you've got the how, when are you gonna do it? Because if you do not allocate the thing, the task, and if you don't see those tasks in your schedule, they will not happen. Here's that is here's a relative. You say, oh, I'm gonna write a blog post. I'm gonna write a blog post. I'm gonna write a blog post.

Aisha Preece [00:15:02]:
But you do not see, I'm gonna write a blog post on Thursday after dinner. You if you don't visualize it and you don't see it, you don't carve out that time, it will not get done. And so for me, I have to I have, like, a calendar oh, you can't really see it. But I have a calendar Monday to Friday to Monday to Sunday, and I say, okay. Today, I'm gonna do this. So tomorrow, I'm gonna do that. You have to carve out the time to to work on the task that you've just broken down. So you say, alright, keyword research.

Aisha Preece [00:15:31]:
I'm gonna find 5 new topics for Pinterest. Okay. When are you gonna do that? So what you have right? When are you gonna do it? I'm gonna do it, after dinner tomorrow, and so I'm gonna maybe one day, I'm gonna skip the gym instead of going more often. I know it's not good for your health, but if it's a temporary thing, after dinner, I'm gonna give myself one hour, and I'm gonna do find find 5 new topics. Alright. Schedule that in. Boom. Done.

Aisha Preece [00:15:59]:
You hand in, you can tick it off. What are you doing? How are you doing it? When are you doing it? And when you when you already plan your every Sunday, I plan my week. Every Sunday, I look at the week ahead and say, what am I doing and when am I doing it? I write the list of things I need to do, then then I input those tasks in the week. So if I don't if I don't see it, it doesn't happen. If it's there so, you know, wake up in the morning and I straight away, boom, I need to work on this, this, and this. This is what I've allocated for the day. The tasks that I wanna do. Not the goal.

Aisha Preece [00:16:28]:
The tasks that are gonna bring me to the goal. So it makes it more actionable. Okay? So now let's just say you've you've another thing that's gonna help with procrastination is you know your distractions. Cut we know we know our distractions. For me, people distract me. I love I love chatting. Right? So I love talking to people. My family and my family live near, my husband.

Aisha Preece [00:16:51]:
I find the best way for me to get lots of lots of work done and focus on my tasks is I just have to get up earlier. I know it's not easy, but, like, I'll get up at 6 AM or sometimes 5:30. Not every day. I can't do that. And then some of you superwomen and supermen can do that, but I can't. And I know. Excuse me. On the days or the weeks that are pretty busy, I just get up early and say, no one disturb me.

Aisha Preece [00:17:15]:
It's quiet. Minimize distractions. You need to put yourself in a position where it's easy. If your phone is distracting you, put your phone in another room. If it's your kids that are distracting you. Okay? How are you going to plan for 1 hour, get your partner to look after 1 hour, get your family to look after 1 hour, book a babysitter if you can afford it. You need to minimize the distractions so you can really focus on that task. You know what those distractions are.

Aisha Preece [00:17:39]:
Okay? And so for me, people distract me. So what I do is I get up super early when when no one's up. Okay? Now another thing that really helps me with procrastination is accepting that 80% is better than nothing. For example, right, this presentation, I'm quite sick. I have a renovation going on, and I kept on procrastination. I said, I'll do it tomorrow because there'll be less noise. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll feel better.

Aisha Preece [00:18:06]:
And I said, you know what? I'd rather show up and teach something that's valuable, hopefully valuable for you. And it'll I show up coughing. I show up snotty with a bit of noise in the background. They're not show up at all. Sometimes you just gotta show up, and 80% is better than nothing at all. Okay? So if you wanna do some keyword research, hey. Listen. If you come up with 3 keywords instead of 5, no problem.

Aisha Preece [00:18:28]:
Something is better than nothing. Okay? So I want you to show up regardless of if if it's you show up ugly, show up lazy, show up snotty. 80% or even 20% is better than nothing. Okay? Now here's a reality that people don't talk about. Right? They think once you start, it's gonna you know, think you're gonna get in the state flow. Or is it what's it called? You guys know better. Put in the chat. It's called the flow, the state of flow or whatever.

Aisha Preece [00:18:55]:
Every single time I try something new or a task that's quite challenging, it is extremely painful. And I get angry. I'm like, this is painful. Like, even creating this presentation, I felt a bit of overwhelm and impostor syndrome. I was like, oh, I don't know if I'm teaching the right thing. It's painful to go through that, but I want you to work through those steps and have a tolerance to pain. If this feels painful, this feels uncomfortable, I'm doing it even if it feels uncomfortable. Okay? And so if you don't really know how to write a blog post, you feel like your blog post is a bit shitty, you feel, you know, you're you're it's it's like you're overwhelmed.

Aisha Preece [00:19:32]:
I want you to work through the painful stuff. It's painful. It's uncomfortable. We accept it, but we continue taking action. It's meant to feel like that. And then like a muscle, you know, when you work at the gym, the first few times are very painful. Right? Your muscles hurting. And after a while, your muscles get used to it.

Aisha Preece [00:19:49]:
You get into the flow of things. It's exactly the same with any task that you're working on. Now and the price that I told you, to make those break those tasks down as much as possible. So remember how we said, I you wanna earn $2,000 a month, so we're gonna break it down. Traffic times monetization equals income. Alright. We're gonna break it down further. Traffic.

Aisha Preece [00:20:09]:
Okay. How we're gonna get the traffic? Maybe Pinterest. How we're gonna get the Pinterest traffic? We move backwards. So let's just say you did 5 new keywords. Take that. Give us a pat on the back. Make these tasks small so you can reward yourself along the way. Don't just reward yourself for the result.

Aisha Preece [00:20:28]:
Reward yourself for taking action because the actions are gonna bring us results. Often, we measure ourselves with results, don't we? We're like, what how do I achieve this? I wanna achieve why. I don't measure myself with results. I measure myself with actions. How many actions have I taken today? When I look at my to do list at the end of the week, I don't say, did I achieve x? I say, did I do x? Did I finish the task that I said that I was set out to do? Because if you do the actions, the results will naturally come. And then what happen is you will get momentum. Once you've gone through the pain and you keep on going through, you will get momentum. And once you have momentum, it's really hard to stop you.

Aisha Preece [00:21:07]:
Okay? So now you're just at the point now you're procrastinating. I want you to I want you to work through it. I want you to work through the pain. I want you to break it down, and I want you to carve out time and work through the painful actions, and suddenly you'll get momentum. Okay? Now the second thing I'm gonna teach you today is self doubt and, self doubt. Okay? So what happens is another big thing that stops us from succeeding in our blogs is we feel imposter syndrome, and we feel, I don't feel I'm good enough to write this. I don't feel I'm good enough to teach this. I don't think I know enough to create this digital product.

Aisha Preece [00:21:45]:
I don't feel I know enough to write this top content. And this is basically imposter syndrome and self doubt. Now I've got the reality check for you guys and goals. Okay? You do not need to be the the most knowledgeable to teach. You just need to be 1 step ahead, and I'm gonna give you a practical example. Okay? Now I've said this before, and if you follow my Instagram, I've said I've said this before where I'm actually quite terrified to have children. I don't have children right now. I have I have a cat.

Aisha Preece [00:22:14]:
You know, she's my child. But the thought of having children actually terrifies me because I'm like, how am I gonna take care of a child when I can't even take care of myself? Okay? But the thing is, if I was to ever have a kid or want to have a kid, I might do, you know, I would rather learn from a mom who is just a new mom in the trenches learning and implementing there's somebody who's a doctor, who's got it all figured out, perfect life. I just I'm gonna learn from somebody who's just right ahead of me, who's in the trenches, learns, has actionable strategies. Similarly, for blogging, if I say, oh, I'm making $1,000,000 a month for my blogs. I have a huge team. You know, I I'm I wanna have it all figured out. I think I'd be quite unrelatable, but you know I'm running these 6 blogs. I'm in the trenches learning when Google updates are happening.

Aisha Preece [00:23:08]:
I'm learning new strategies, learning different email marketing, and I'm teaching them along the way. So I find my students find that more relatable. They can relate to me more. Similar with you, if you're like a pro gardener, I think it's a much less relatable if you're like, you know, on a cooking show compared to a mom who's, like, trying to cook with kids and, like, have nutritious meals. I think being able to be one step ahead actually is your competitive advantage. So you don't actually need to be perfect. You don't need to be 1 step ahead. You know, oh, I figured I had to make my kids sleep for 1 night.

Aisha Preece [00:23:43]:
I'm gonna teach that. It may not work every night, but I wanna learn that strategy. Right? I've learned how not to kill my basil plants. Share that tip. You know? So I think being one step ahead is is actually might way more valuable than being super, super experienced. Number 2, here's what I've realized. Right? You can make it click with your personality and your experience. How many times, right, we've heard a topic so many times, but then it takes one person to finally make it click.

Aisha Preece [00:24:13]:
It was like that for me with Google traffic and with Pinterest. I took so many courses, but it was one particular teacher that was, like, the way that he taught made it click for me. I was, like, oh. And then it implemented it. Same with you. Right? You might have a way of connecting with somebody that that in a way communicating in a way using your personal experience that can make it click for them. So whatever you're teaching, don't worry if someone is more experienced than you because you're gonna be able to connect connect with a person who is similar to you. So I'm at you know, for example, I might relate better to women.

Aisha Preece [00:24:51]:
I'm half Asian, half English. You know, maybe I can relate to a different part of the world too. Whereas, there are men that wanna learn from men, And, you know, I'm just saying that you can make a click with your personal experience. Okay? And that's very valuable. And number 3, and this is a big thing, and I'm really guilty of it. Right? Often, I think, I just wanna take one more course. One more course, and then I'm ready. One more training, one more bit of coaching, and then I can I can teach this? I can do this.

Aisha Preece [00:25:19]:
And to be honest, you could take all the courses in the world, but it's a bit like swimming. You could take all the courses you want about swimming, but unless you get in the swim and practice, you're not gonna be ready. Okay? So with your blog excuse me. Taking action on your blog, making mistakes, failing repeatedly is going to build up your skills so you learn what not to do and what to do, and you will feel ready. This this taking action is what's gonna help you overcome your self doubt. Okay? Not doing more courses. And I know you're here taking lots of courses, but I just wanna remind you, it's a bit like swimming. You need to get in there and swim.

Aisha Preece [00:25:54]:
Okay? Now another thing that really, really helps us. For the longest time, I could not understand why my Instagram works. My Instagram is, compared to, like, big influencers, quite small. Okay? But it's grown over time. And I said, why my Instagram is like, I look like I haven't combed my hair. There's no there's no rhyme or reason. There's no strategy. It looks pretty sporadic, but it works.

Aisha Preece [00:26:18]:
It makes me money. They're engaged. People in my community respond to my polls, get great feedback. I was like, why is it that this why does my Instagram work? And I realized because I'm not afraid to share the good and the bad. When things go wrong, when shit hits the fan, when I get Google updates, when I get troll comments, when I get bad experiences, when I fail, I share that on my Instagram and people relate to that. That vulnerability, that self doubt that you're feeling, it makes you human. It makes because everyone feels it whether they like to admit it or not. And when you make when you show up as a real human in this world of AI, that is what makes people connect with you.

Aisha Preece [00:26:58]:
So your self doubt in a way makes you human, and if you take action anyway and you share it, I think it really, really helps. And so finally, there's a saying shame hides in the dark. Right? If you come out and you admit your shame and you admit your self doubt, you are not giving you are you are you are removing the power that self doubt has over you. For example, right, for example, I've always said with my content and with my example, you look at my Instagram. Right? I am not the typical influencer. Like, half the days, I I don't wear makeup. I I don't comb my hair. I can look quite scruffy.

Aisha Preece [00:27:36]:
I try my best not to. I try to show up in a presentable way, but I say it. I say, listen. I am running a whole business. I have a whole husband, bought a house. I'm I'm just with countries. Life is life in right now. And to be honest, I don't look like I don't look all put together.

Aisha Preece [00:27:54]:
And I come out and I say it. So it's almost like, oh my god. Like, your hair is so messy. I'm like, yeah. I know that. I said it. I told you. I told you my hair looks messy.

Aisha Preece [00:28:03]:
Or if they say, oh my god. You look so disorganized. I know. I told you. I've got, like, I've got a lot of things in life going. So if you come out and talk about things that you're feeling embarrassed about, hey, guys. I feel like, you know, I wanna teach gardening, but sometimes my my sometimes my my my my my basil dies. Sometimes my my peas don't wanna pea.

Aisha Preece [00:28:26]:
They don't wanna come out. Talk about it. Come out and say it, and shame is like mold. You shine light on it, and it will it will cower away because then you own it and you stand up and say, I'm gonna show up regardless if I'm feeling like this, regardless if I'm showing up ugly. It's okay. It's okay to show up ugly and doubtful. Okay? I just want you to say, like, anything that you wanna teach it and you're feeling so bad, talk about it. Talk about it, and people will relate and have empathies towards it.

Aisha Preece [00:28:57]:
