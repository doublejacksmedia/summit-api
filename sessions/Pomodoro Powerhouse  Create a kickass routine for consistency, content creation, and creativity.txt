Welcome. This is Pomodoro Powerhouse. Create a kickass routine for consistency, content creation, and creativity. I'm Sage Grayson, and I'm super happy to be here today for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Get ready to learn how the Pomodoro Technique can make you a more consistent and powerful blogger. Let's go.

[00:00:34.180] - Sage Grayson
Who is this session for? This session is best for beginners who are new to blogging and content creation. You probably don't have a consistent schedule yet for completing your work, meeting deadlines, and implementing all the new strategies you're discovering. But this session will help you get on track so you can make steady progress without burning yourself out by using the Pomodoro Technique. Now, are you an intermediate or advanced blogger? Well, I want you to stick around anyway for my best tips to supercharge your time management and inject some fun into your work schedule. Who's Sage Grayson? That's me. I'm Sage. I'm a former book editor turned life and business coach. Since 2011, I've been helping ambitious women entrepreneurs edit their habits, routines, and mindsets to balance their happiness at work and home. I'm a life editor, and so are you. I'm a vegan, bi-sexual Buddhist who loves reading self-development books and quoting "The Simpsons" endlessly. I live for boosting productivity and streamlining systems to get stuff done. You can find me on YouTube for my business channel, also on YouTube for my reading channel, on Facebook, Pinterest, and of course, my blog, sagegrayson.com.

[00:01:53.520] - Sage Grayson
Now, before we get started, to get the most out of this session, please just take a minute to silence your phone, close any other open tabs, and grab a notebook or planner to capture the best strategies so you won't miss a thing. Here are our session objectives. First, we're going to talk about what is the Pomodoro Technique. Then I'm going to show you how you can use Pomodoro Sprint for content creation. Then I've got 30 fun ways to focus your Pomodoro Sprint. And of course, I'm going to give you your next steps and a special freebie if you stick around to the end. Now, what is the Pomodoro Technique? Well, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique's name, Pomodoro, which means tomato in Italian, was inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo initially used. Now, Cirillo was a university student struggling with productivity and time management.

[00:02:53.910] - Sage Grayson
We've all been there. He wanted to improve his focus and complete tasks more efficiently. After many experiments, he discovered that 25 minutes was an optimal duration to maintain concentration without causing burnout. We like that. Now here is the basic Pomodoro Technique, and I'm going to give you some examples for how you can edit this technique in just a little bit, so hang on.

[00:03:19.650] - Sage Grayson
Here's the basic technique. Number one, you're going to choose a task. Select a specific task to work on that can be completed in one Pomodoro. That's 25 minutes. Number two, set your timer. Set a timer for 25 minutes to work on only the chosen task, nothing else. Number three, work until the timer rings. During the Pomodoro, focus exclusively on the task at hand. Resist the urge to engage in distractions or to switch tasks. Number four, take a break. Once the timer rings, take a short five-minute break. This allows for a quick mental recharge. Oh, yeah. And, number five, of course, you're going to repeat. After completing four Pomodoro's, which is two hours, take a longer break of around 15 to 30 minutes. The Pomodoro technique continues to increase in popularity and has been adopted by individuals, professionals, and teams worldwide for its simplicity and effectiveness in combating procrastination and enhancing productivity.

[00:04:23.040] - Sage Grayson
Now, I got to ask you, have you tried the Pomodoro Technique? And if so, how did you alter it for your business, lifestyle, energy levels, etc.? I can't wait to hear your thoughts.

[00:04:35.460] - Sage Grayson
Here's how we do Pomodoro Sprint for content creation. First, do a brain dump and write down everything you want to get done. Just let your thoughts flow. Maybe it's writing, planning, uploading, photo and image creation, social media, scheduling, and more. Then you're going to choose your next most important projects. Maybe you have some deadlines coming up or you have something that has a really high return on investment, or the ones that must get done today or this week. You can choose your Pomodoro Sprint for just today, or you might do a week's worth of planning in advance. It's up to you. Then you're going to define your time budget. That is how much time you have to work during the day or the week to devote to your Pomodoros. So maybe you have two hours a day or five hours a day, or maybe you have four hours on two separate days. It really depends on what your specific schedule looks like.

[00:05:33.870] - Sage Grayson
If you want to learn more about creating an effective time budget, then you're going to want to stick around to the end where I share my freebie with you. Next, identify what you'll work on for each Pomodoro. You may work on a single project for the entire session or switch tasks with each Pomodoro. Plan what you'll do during your breaks. This is important, too. Maybe you'll stretch, use the bathroom, read a book, make a cup of tea. I found that having something to look forward to makes it much easier to focus during those 25-minute Pomodoros. Then you're going to set up your Timer for your Sprint. Now, you could use an app, and there are dozens of Pomodoro apps out there, or you could just simply use the timer on your phone. You'll set it up for 25 minutes of working, followed by a five-minute break and have it repeating. Finally, you're going to run your Sprint and focus only on the task for that Pomodoro. And don't stop until the timer goes off. All right, here's the best part. I've got 30 fun ways to focus your Pomodoro Sprint. Now, for this part, I want you to write down the ideas that you want to try next to help you maintain a consistent content creation schedule. Then you're going to circle or highlight your top five and start implementing those Pomodoros this week.

[00:06:54.910] - Sage Grayson
All right, let's go. Subject-based Sprint. You can focus on subjects, categories, or tasks during each Pomodoro session. For example, work on writing for one session, then switch to research for the next one, then switch to editing for the next one, and on and on.

[00:07:12.630] - Sage Grayson
Creative Writing Sprint. Set specific word count goals for each 25-minute session. Then try to beat that word count with each following session. Or choose a different writing prompt or topic for each session, such as blog categories.

[00:07:28.010] - Sage Grayson
Multitasking Sprint. Now, multitasking isn't all bad, really. You could alternate between two or more tasks within each 25-minute session to keep things fresh. For example, you might write social media posts for 15 minutes and then schedule them for 10 minutes, completing your 25-minute Pomodoro Sprint.

[00:07:49.610] - Sage Grayson
Content Creation Sprint. Use each Pomodoro session to create content for your website, blog, social media, and other platforms. See how many Pomodoros it takes to write a blog post versus a YouTube video script. This will help you for planning your time in the future.

[00:08:07.480] - Sage Grayson
Focused Distraction Time. Dedicate one Pomodoro session to handle all potential distractions. And I know there's a lot of them. Maybe your emails, your messages, your notifications, and then shut them off for the following sessions. This gives you a clean slate before you begin your most important work.

[00:08:27.090] - Sage Grayson
Brain Dump Sprint. Use one Pomodoro to brainstorm ideas for blog post, projects, digital products, social media posts, videos, or other creative endeavors. Get it all out of your head to reduce anxiety before you begin your focused work. This one really works for me.

[00:08:46.360] - Sage Grayson
Mindfulness Meditation. Insert a mindfulness exercise or meditation into one of your Pomodoro sessions to relax and rejuvenate your mind. So, determine when during that day you're most tired or unmotivated, and then plan to do a meditation then. For me, that's around two or three in the afternoon. That's when my energy starts tanking, and that's when I need a refresh.

[00:09:11.860] - Sage Grayson
Skills Enhancement Sprint. Spend at least one Pomodoro session each day learning or enhancing a new skill. I love it. You might watch a Skillshare class, or read a book in your field, or try a new software or app, or watch Summit videos to learn from the best.

[00:09:30.120] - Sage Grayson
Incremental Breaks. Gradually increase the length of your breaks starting with five minutes and adding a minute to each cycle. This is helpful for those of us who lose energy over the course of the day and need longer to recharge after a period of focused work.

[00:09:47.200] - Sage Grayson
Sprint and Reflect. After each Pomodoro session, spend a few minutes of your break reflecting on what you accomplished and planning for the next session. I like to keep a progress journal to remind myself of all the work I already completed, especially when I'm feeling unmotivated. This is very, very helpful.

[00:10:07.890] - Sage Grayson
Daily Journaling. Dedicate a Pomodoro session to journaling your thoughts, experiences, and goals. Now, you could follow a guided journal with specific prompts or just let your thoughts flow onto the page naturally. You might want to see the morning pages exercise in the book "The Artist's Way" by Julia Cameron.

[00:10:29.060] - Sage Grayson
Visualization and Goal Setting. Spend a session visualizing your goals and creating a plan to achieve them. You might make a list of people who have achieved the goals that you want and then figure out what steps they took that you can duplicate.

[00:10:44.630] - Sage Grayson
Mini Workshop Live Streams. Conduct mini workshops or training sessions for clients or social media followers during each Pomodoro session. This is so fun. This built-in time limit keeps you on topic and provides those short and sweet tips for your audience. You might consider TikTok videos or YouTube shorts.

[00:11:07.810] - Sage Grayson
Reading Sprint. Set a goal to read a specific number of pages or chapters in a book during each session. I do reading Sprints a lot. As a former book editor, of course I do. Time how long it takes you to read an average page and then multiply that by the number of pages to determine how many Sprints you'll need to finish the book. Here's a very basic example. Let's say you time yourself and it takes you about one minute to complete reading an average page. If you have a book that is 100 pages long and you read at one minute per page, then it will take you four Pomodoros, that's 25, 25, 25, 25 to complete the book or two hours. I use this all the time when I am considering what book I'm going to read next and how much time do I have to devote to it.

[00:12:01.220] - Sage Grayson
Skills Sharpening. Practice and refine specific skills related to your profession during each Pomodoro. For example, if you're a YouTuber, practice speaking clearly on camera and building your on-air confidence.

[00:12:15.490] - Sage Grayson
Mind Mapping. Use Pomodoro sessions to create mind maps for organizing thoughts, ideas, and projects. This is an excellent exercise for mapping out the main categories for your blog and then pulling out the topics for each category to see where things overlap and build on each other.

[00:12:33.720] - Sage Grayson
Visual Art Creation. Focus on creating sketches, digital art, or any form of visual art during each session. Do you have a shop to fill? Plan a specific number of Pomodoros each week for creating your art so you always have something to add to your portfolio or shop. This happens to many of my clients who sell physical products or their art is that they're working so much on their shop and their website and their blog that they're not actually making their art. Make sure you fit in a Pomodoro where you're actually creating your visual art.

[00:13:09.830] - Sage Grayson
Decluttering Sessions. Do you find it hard to get started when your room is messy? Me too! Dedicate a Pomodoro session to de-clutter and organize your workspace or living area, and then you won't be tempted to clean up while you're doing your focused work. Does anyone else do that? Oh, I've got to clean my desk first before I can work. Oh, I got to do the dishes first before I can work. No more. Do your de-cluttering session for one Pomodoro and then keep on moving.

[00:13:39.620] - Sage Grayson
Networking and Outreach. Spend a session reaching out to mentors, accountability partners, contacts, "super fans", or other people who could support you and your blog in some way. Reach out on social media or send those follow-up emails asking for specific guidance. I've always found that giving them a specific request gets a better result than just generally reaching out.

[00:14:05.580] - Sage Grayson
Digital Detox. You need a self-care session. We all do. Disconnect completely during your Pomodoro sessions to increase focus and minimize distractions. You might even use a non-digital timer, which you can find on Amazon, or write by hand in a notebook instead of typing on your laptop, or otherwise forego technology and screens.

[00:14:30.190] - Sage Grayson
Photography Challenges. Use each session to go out and capture specific themes or subjects through photography. Now, this is helpful if your blog is about travel, lifestyle, recipe, shopping, books, or something else. It's great for filling your social media accounts too.

[00:14:48.370] - Sage Grayson
Search Engine Optimization or SEO. Focus on optimizing your meta tags, descriptions, and keywords during each 25-minute session. Now, successful bloggers focus on more than just the writing. You could have the best content in the world, but without SEO, no one will read it.

[00:15:09.880] - Sage Grayson
Email Management. Allocate at least one Pomodoro session to respond to emails, clean out your inbox, and organize your email system. This "clearing the decks" exercise will help you feel less scattered and make sure you don't miss any important notices. For me, I often publish guest posts and sponsored posts, which means I need to check my emails to see if there's any new content. So give yourself one Pomodoro session to make sure you're not missing anything important in your inbox.

[00:15:40.790] - Sage Grayson
Product Development Sprints. Break down the process of creating a new product or service into Pomodoro sessions, focusing on the different stages. You might first search for old content you can repurpose, then edit it, then create slides, then upload it to your CRM, etc. Many of my clients have had success by going through their old blog post, pulling out similar themes, and then creating ebooks or workshops based on that old content. You might wonder, well, why would anyone buy something that they can find on your blog for free? The reason is nobody's got time to crawl through your archives trying to find the information they need. By gathering up similar pieces of content and repurposing it into a new product, you make it easier for your clients and customers. And, you can quickly fill your shop with new products without having to make something from scratch.

[00:16:35.510] - Sage Grayson
Analytics and Reporting. What's working for your blog and what's not? Use sessions to review website analytics, track conversion rates, and generate reports. I know this is the boring stuff, but it's so helpful. Determine your top 10 most viewed pieces of content and then optimize your images, opt-in boxes, interlinking, and more. I have many of my clients go through their old blog posts, find out which ones are most popular, then create new images to add to those blog posts so that they are pinnable on Pinterest. It's also good to check to make sure you don't have any outdated information or broken links.

[00:17:16.230] - Sage Grayson
Social Media Engagement. Engage with your audience. Respond to comments and schedule posts during each session. If you want people to read your blog, watch your videos, or listen to your podcast, you must do the marketing so they know you exist. You can't ignore social media as much as you might want to.

[00:17:35.590] - Sage Grayson
Market Research and Trends. Spend sessions researching industry trends, doing competitor analyses, and studying customer behavior. This helps your content be more topical and buzzworthy and prevents you from writing pieces your readers aren't interested in.

[00:17:53.130] - Sage Grayson
Affiliate Program Management. Make some moolah from your blog. Use Pomodoro sessions to review and manage your affiliate partnerships and marketing efforts. Now, this is your affiliate program for yourself and other people's affiliate programs that you support. Take one Pomodoro to research your top affiliates for your program. Is there a way that you can reward them in addition to the commission they're already getting? I know business owners who have contests once a month to see who is the top affiliate, and then they get an extra bonus prize. It's a nice way to remind people to keep sharing their links.

[00:18:31.560] - Sage Grayson
A/B testing and Optimization. Focus on testing different elements of your website or marketing campaigns during each session. Which opt-in boxes are getting the most signups on your blog? And which pinned image brings the most traffic to your blog or shop? I think you might be surprised if you actually look at the data.

[00:18:53.070] - Sage Grayson
And finally, Strategic Planning. Dedicate Pomodoro sessions to develop and refine your business strategy, set goals and plan for growth. No more winging it. No, you're not going to do that anymore. If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Make sure that you're working towards goals that matter to you. All it takes is dedicating some time to focus on your strategic plan.

[00:19:20.350] - Sage Grayson
That's it. Let's do a summary of everything that you learned during today's session. The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. Each Pomodoro consists of 25 minutes of working time, followed by a five-minute break and repeat it for at least two hours. Set up your Pomodoro Sprint for content creation so you can make steady, consistent progress on your blog. The most successful creators don't wing it. The technique can be adapted to fit your time budget, your business, your lifestyle, your energy levels, and more. Remember, have fun with it.

[00:19:57.540] - Sage Grayson
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to level up your content creation? Which strategies will you try to implement the Pomodoro Technique into your blogging schedule? Now, I hope you have a big list of Pomodoro ideas that you want to try. Now, I want you to circle or highlight at least five ideas that you can start implementing this week. Don't just listen to this session. I want you to really take some action and do your Pomodoro Sprint.
