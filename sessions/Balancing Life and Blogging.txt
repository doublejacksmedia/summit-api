Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Today, I'm really excited for the session with Kristine, from Blogging about Momming. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Kristine Beaves [00:00:09]:
Thank you for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:10]:
Yeah. So you're gonna be talking about sort of how to balance blogging with life. Right? You know? Especially I mean, it's especially difficult for, parents. But but in general, if you have a 9 to 5 and you're trying squeezing your blog, you're trying to have a life and actually sleep, you know, it can be Yeah. Exactly. You know, because sleep is important. I'm a big fan of sleep.

Kristine Beaves [00:00:34]:
I mentioned it. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:36]:
Can you can you tell us a little bit about your background and then just kind of the highlights of what you're gonna cover today?

Kristine Beaves [00:00:42]:
So as you said, I'm Kristine from bloggingaboutmomming.com. I also have another blog. I'm a virtual assistant. I'm a former project manager and I have 2 kids, ages 2 and 4. So I'm super busy and the reason I kinda got into all of this is 5 years ago I had my first child, and it was a lot. So I decided to start a blog and I had no idea what I was doing. I looked back at my old stuff and I just cringe And, you know, balance you know, figuring out how to make it all work together, you know, we have some really great speakers in this summit that are gonna tell you about email marketing and how to make money blogging or start a podcast. And the one thing that a lot of people don't really talk about is how challenging it is to actually find the time to do the do all this this huge amount of stuff you're supposed to do as a blogger.

Kristine Beaves [00:01:27]:
So that's kind of what I do is I I with client work or through my blog, I help, you know, usually moms, but also regular bloggers, figure out how to make it all work together.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:38]:
Alright. Awesome. And so you're gonna give us some, some tips and some actual advice, I take it?

Kristine Beaves [00:01:43]:
I am. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:44]:
Alright. Well, I'm looking forward to that because, I I've been in the same boat. Right? So it's always a it's a balancing act. It's a high wire act or whatnot. Yeah. So I'm excited to to get to your presentation. Let's dig in.

Kristine Beaves [00:01:58]:
Alright. Thank you. Hi, everybody. Today, I wanna talk about balancing your life and your blogging. And some of you may be thinking, why am I covering this topic? Well, there are a lot of amazing speakers in this summit, and I think one of the things that we really don't get into is how to actually find time to blog while you've got all this other crazy stuff going on in your life. You know, maybe you're a work at home mom. Maybe you have a day day job. There's a lot of different things that go into this, and, you know, you're gonna hear you're probably really interested in hearing the talks about how to make money blogging or how to help you with your email marketing or maybe you wanna start a podcast, but in order to do that, you really need to figure out how to find the time and the energy and the brain space to actually make that happen and accomplish your goals.

Kristine Beaves [00:02:48]:
So as you've heard, I am my name is Kristine, and I am a former project manager. I used to work on projects for mobile applications for companies like Nick Jr, Toys R Us, rest in peace, Microsoft, and a bunch of others. And I am now a work at home mom, and I have 2 blogs. 1 is to help bloggers and mom bloggers, and I'm also a virtual assistant that also helps bloggers, and I have a crazy busy life. I have 2 kids. They're ages 2 and 4, and my one of them is special needs. So my specialty is really about helping people find the time to do what they love and figure out how to make it all work together. To start things off, I am gonna talk about something that I don't even remember where I heard about this, but I always talk to my clients and my blogging buddies about the burner analogy.

Kristine Beaves [00:03:49]:
So this is like a glorified pie chart of your life. So there's basically 4 different areas in your life, and I know this is an oversimplification, but think of this like a pie chart. You have 4 different burners in your life that you want to grow, you want to have fulfillment within. Maybe you wanna be you know, you need to focus on your health. You obviously need to eat right. You wanna take care of your mental health. You wanna make sure you're working out if possible, even if it's just going for walks. And then you've got your work, and that's where you you're gonna make your money, and that's where your career focus is.

Kristine Beaves [00:04:22]:
You also have your family. Maybe you have kids. Maybe you're married or have a partner. You also have extended family that you probably wanna spend time with. And then you also have friends, so that's your social life. You know? Getting close with your friends is really important and having that support group around you. So where do you focus all your time when you have all of these different priorities in your life? And so I've I've put together a few examples, and these will change based on where you are in your life. You know? Maybe you have young kids right now.

Kristine Beaves [00:04:53]:
And so if you have young kids, maybe you can only spend 15% of your time you know, picture a pie chart here, 15% of your time with your kids and 30% on work. Yeah. I mean, when you have young kids, you don't have as much time as some people to work on your blog, And the last thing you wanna do is is actually neglect your sleep. You know, a lot of us moms have to stay up late to get our our tasks done for our blog. But this also goes into, you know, your health. You wanna make sure that you're getting enough sleep. So you have less time to work, you need to spend more time with your family, and you may not have the time you need you want, I should say, to spend with your friends. And then imagine, for those of you out there who are full time day job people who actually go to a day job 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and you're blogging.

Kristine Beaves [00:05:43]:
And and for those of you that have a day job, you blog, and you also have kids. Power to you. Holy moly. I can't even imagine. I'm a I am a work at home mom and that's hard enough. So you're gonna have a lot of time that you're gonna spend on working and you're gonna have a lot less time to focus on the other areas of your life that you actually care about. So maybe your main goal in all of this and in blogging is actually quitting that day job and becoming a full time Blogger. So your burners, your percentages, will actually change.

Kristine Beaves [00:06:15]:
And okay. So the next one I have is maybe your, you blog full time because you have school age kids. So while they're in school, you're actually working. So you have more time to work, but you need to do you have more time with your family because you have those kids that'll come home after school. So the reason that I mention this is that it's a good example of why you need to stop comparing yourself to other bloggers. Every blogger has a different circumstance. You are fighting against an entire spectrum of bloggers who can either have 8 hours a day to work on it, maybe it's 12, Maybe you're maybe you're a workaholic. But if you only have 2 hours a day that you can actually dedicate to your blog, you're gonna be have a hard time measuring yourself up and comparing yourself to other bloggers who have more time and energy to do this.

Kristine Beaves [00:07:07]:
And that's why I'm gonna get into, yes, yet another analogy. And this just bear with me here. Blogging is like conducting a symphony. It really is. If you think about it, think about all the different things you need to do as a blogger. And here, we'll get into it a little bit. So bear with me here because I am not a music person, but this is how I kind of visualize it in my head. So there's all these different instruments in the orchestra.

Kristine Beaves [00:07:37]:
They have their place. They have their their part to play within that symphony. There's you know, say the drums are like your blog content because that's what really matters. That's gonna set the tempo of your business. You have to have good content constantly going out there. And then you also have the horns or the brass. That's your email marketing, and that's gonna be announcing your presence to your audience. So those are the people that actively want to engage with you and are on your email list.

Kristine Beaves [00:08:02]:
And then you have flutes, the woodwinds. So that's your social media. You're you're supporting your melody by constantly updating social media. You have violins, which is really like a frenzied look. You know? All of us want to make money blogging, at least the the vast majority of us. And you can do it really slow if if you're in a down phase, if you're, say, you're coming out of Christmas. And then when you get to the that Christmas season where you're you're potentially gonna make a lot of sales, you know, you're you're you're really banging on that violin back and forth back and forth as fast as you can. The violins are going to really be if you really think about it, it's how that that's just for me, if you visualize it, that is how you're gonna make your money.

Kristine Beaves [00:08:44]:
And then, you know, I picture the cellos, the deep strings, as the backbone of your business. That is going to be your brand. That is what you're gonna that's your voice. That's your visuals. That's everything. And then, of course, there's the conductor, which is you, and you are the brand owner. And you are the one that is in charge of making sure that all of these different instruments are working together and making a melody that people actually want to listen to. But the orchestra is much more than just having the instruments.

Kristine Beaves [00:09:16]:
You know, you you when you first start blogging, if you're brand new to if you automatically jump in there as the conductor and try making a symphony with all of these instruments, it's gonna be a mess. So the pitch of your symphony is basically like forming those connections with your brand and your audience. You're also gonna have to figure out what key it's in. That's your written voice, being consistent with your brand. And then the chords, which are a grouping of pitches, is your partnership between your content types and communication, so your email marketing, your social updates, all tying into your content. And the crescendo Liz, you know, just like I talked about with those violins, you know, you're that's when the crescendo is when the the music gets really loud. It builds and builds and builds up to that climax. And there if you're launching a product, if you're gearing up for the holidays, you're gonna have your work and your presence is going to build up and up and up and hopefully make a lot of sales or at least get a lot of visitors on your blog.

Kristine Beaves [00:10:23]:
And then there's the melody. And this is really how you have a cohesive message with your audience, so how all the instruments are working together. And then there's the harmony, which is understanding and answering the questions of your audience in a way that attracts them to follow you. You want to have a symphony with a harmony that people actually want to follow. They want you to be consistent. They want you to be a real you're going to answer all the questions that they have, so you're going to hit all those right notes to make that symphony really work and make people be dedicated to your brand. And as I mentioned before, you want to master each instrument separately. You wanna make sure that, say, you wanna start off with you know, if you're a brand new blogger, you want your content to be the first thing that you you focus on and maybe email marketing because you wanna get that your dedicated audience right on your email list, and you want to keep them engaged with you.

Kristine Beaves [00:11:27]:
And the other thing is as a conductor, you have to take breaks. Your arms are gonna get tired conducting all of those instruments, so you want to take breaks. And you need to realize that whether you're new or you've been blogging for a long time, your audience is gonna grow as you master all of these just different instruments. You're gonna hit different parts of the audience. Some of them really wanna interact with you on social media. Some of them want to just go to your blog and see what's going on. Some of them really love your emails. There's different ways you're gonna communicate you and your brand to your audience.

Kristine Beaves [00:12:06]:
So as you start mastering all these different parts, you're gonna get more people, more readers on your blog. And so you have to take all of these different things. Just imagine frantically waving your arms around a a conductor Right to get all of these things lined up, have a symphony, and actually get paying people to sit in your audience to listen to it. And those paying, you know, obviously, that there's, you know, they're paying for their clicking on your affiliate links. They're, signing up for you as a client or they're buying your products or your courses. You want to be able to show that you are not only an expert, but you have a personality, you have a voice that people actually want to follow. Now why am I doing analogies? And we're done with analogies. Don't worry.

Kristine Beaves [00:13:01]:
Because we get so caught up in all of the different things on our checklist. And even if you don't like my analogy, that's okay. But I wanted to illustrate that there is so much that goes into being a blogger. And you know what? This analogy works for everything in your life as well. You can easily translate conducting an orchestra to being a parent or maintaining relationships with your friends. There's there's so many different things you need to do, and instead of having it being a checklist, sometimes getting out of your head, getting away from the data and the planning, is actually really good to actually really think about this in the big picture. So let's actually get into how you can balance your life and blogging. And the first thing that I always suggest to my clients and my readers is to define your pain points.

Kristine Beaves [00:14:04]:
What are you struggling with? What is stressing you out? What is challenging you on a day to day basis? And then what we'll get into is setting realistic and measurable goals. Then we'll think about ways that we can be creative about finding time to actually reach our goals, and then we'll actually talk about making those changes, actually making those changes in your life to have a more fulfilling day every single day. Okay. Now we're gonna get into actually planning. So you'll want to get down, get down into the nitty gritty and figure out a schedule that dedicates time to figuring out your priorities and creating goals. And I wanna at least stress that, you know, we do have all of these pain points, and they're not all we can't spend all of our time making our lives better. We can't spend all of our time fixing the things that we are struggling with because there's things every single day that we need to do even if they aren't a priority to make us a happier person. And, you know, going back to the analogy, say you personally really don't like the sound of the horns.

Kristine Beaves [00:15:20]:
You hate them. And that is your email marketing. You if you really, really hate trying to come up with content consistently to send to your email list, that's gonna be a pain point. But you really I mean, if that's a priority for you to have an email list, which for most bloggers should be, you're going to have to dig into those horns and learn how they work. And and for as an example, maybe you work full time, but you don't enjoy your job. But it's a priority to you because you need the money. So the first thing, as I talked about, what we wanna do is define your pain points. And so all of this all this is is looking at every aspect of your life, not just blogging, and figure out what is causing you stress.

Kristine Beaves [00:16:07]:
What is challenging you? What can you do to actually what what can you define as the root cause of what of your challenges right now? And that can be a whole spectrum of things. Maybe you don't have a great relationship with your family and you wanna make it better, or you wanna separate yourself a little farther from your family. Maybe you're having a challenging time finding time to vlog, or maybe you feel like you can't be present with your kids. And I know that I'm gonna talk about I know a lot of you don't have kids, and that that's perfectly fine, But that's kind of my focus, and having kids had its own kind of bucket of challenges that go along with it. And sorry. I know this is a lot of text, but I wanted to at least have a visual that you can quickly look at and take notes if you want. So the next thing you want to do is after you've defined your priorities, you'll want to prioritize those. So you you have your pain points, and you'll want to figure out which one is causing you the most stress.

Kristine Beaves [00:17:11]:
And then what you do is you take those priorities and you turn them into goals. Your goal is to reduce your amount of stress in whatever it is that's in your life. For example, say you're stressed that you don't have any time with your kids. You'll wanna turn that priority or that pain point into a goal that's like maybe you wanna spend 1 hour of dedicated time with your kids every single day. So it's measurable. You can tell that you you you know if you don't spend that 1 hour a day every single day with your kids. Or maybe you feel like you're not making enough money from your blog, and your goal will be make a $100 from my blog in the next 3 weeks. So you know that if you don't hit that goal, you're not gonna make a $100 in the next 3 weeks.

Kristine Beaves [00:17:57]:
Does that make sense? And then what you do is you take those goals and you create a plan to actually reach them. And what you'll do is actually take that goal, and think about the end result. So in 3 weeks, you will have made a $100, and you'll start at the end. So you have a $100 in 3 weeks. How are you gonna accomplish that? Start from the end and make your way backwards. So starting to say so at number 4, incentivize purchases with a freebie in week 2. So stepping back and back and back for this particular example. It's for your first step will be to join 2 more affiliate programs by x date.

Kristine Beaves [00:18:38]:
And then once that's done, you'll create blog posts around those programs that you joined with your affiliate link by a certain day. Then you'll promote on social media, whatever you decide, in your email marketing at least once a week. And then, like I mentioned, incentivize the purchase with a freebie in week 2. Define ways that you can actually reach that goal and make your way backwards, and make them measurable and actionable. And in order to actually get to your goals, I want you to start thinking creatively. Sometimes when it comes to actually reaching your goal, it's not about getting help on that goal. It's about getting help to find the time and the brain space to reach that goal. And this can be all sorts of things.

Kristine Beaves [00:19:29]:
For example, for Blogger. You know, I'm sure all of you or most of you are active or at least belong to Facebook groups or some sort of online community where you can get support for blogging. You can somewhere you can ask questions so you're not just constantly searching Google for answers, and you can also you know, there's things like find an accountability partner. Find someone that you can talk to that will help you be accountable towards your goals. Tell them what you wanna do, and you can do this vice versa so they they can actually tell you what their goals are, and you keep each other accountable for reaching those goals. You can also find blogging mentors, and these are a little hard because bloggers are incredibly busy. But this is basically making friends with other Blogger, hopefully within your niche or at least someone that has expertise in an area you wanna work on, and work with them. And in in in many cases, this is actually signing up for coaching, which is obviously paid.

Kristine Beaves [00:20:28]:
So if it's not within your budget, see if you can find another blogger who has an expertise or skills that you want to emulate or learn from and make that connection with them. Do your research and see who are you following right now. Who can you ask questions? You know, you want somebody that you can connect with on a regular basis. And the other one is obviously Blog courses. And you wanna make sure, you know, there's a lot of really great speakers in the summit. Take a look at their resources. See what kind of courses they offer. It's very, very helpful to find the right courses to take.

Kristine Beaves [00:21:04]:
There are free courses out there, but they're not gonna be as informative, at least in many cases, as a paid course because a paid course will have premium top tips and tutorials for you on mastering your blogging career. And the other one is hiring a VA, a virtual assistant. The amount that you'll pay to get a virtual assistant will depend on the virtual assistant, the skills there they have, and basically how much time you want. And the good thing about virtual assistants is they can do pretty much anything, anything. If you hate doing email marketing and you're wasting so much time and energy creating those emails, scheduling those emails, automating your workflows, Find a VA that's good at that, enjoys it, and can take it off your plate. That can be something that that's how you fix your pain point. Okay. So and then there's also things you can do every day that's not about blogging.

Kristine Beaves [00:21:59]:
Now maybe think about how much time you spend every week just going to the grocery store. The time it takes to actually drive there, to do your shopping, waiting in line to check out, and then driving home, unloading the groceries. It's all you would be amazed how much time you spend, especially if you go more than once a week to the grocery store, especially if you have kids. Think about grocery delivery. Order your groceries. Have them delivered. You can be home working on your blog while someone else is doing the shopping for you. I'm not kidding.

Kristine Beaves [00:22:31]:
I do this, and it saves me so much time. I don't have to take my kids with me and get them in and out of the car and stop them from grabbing things on the shelves. You know, I I save myself hours a week just having my groceries delivered. And the next one is housecleaning. If you don't have time to clean, get a house cleaner. You can actually find them fairly inexpensive. Hire a gardener if you if you just either don't enjoy gardening or if you just don't have the time to dedicate to it. Do meal prep.

Kristine Beaves [00:23:05]:
Sched do meal planning once a week once a week. Have your groceries delivered with all the items you need, and then do your meal prep once a week. Save you so much time. If you have a day job, try carpooling. If you carpool, you might be able to sit in the back seat and actually get some work done. Or maybe you don't carpool, maybe you can take the bus. There's so many ways that you can grab little bits of time that actually add up to a big payoff. Now if you are a work at home parent and you have kids, you can do working play dates.

Kristine Beaves [00:23:37]:
And that's where you actually join forces with other parents who have kids who hopefully are doing something at least similar to what you're doing. And you just take turns watching the kids while the other person works, and then you trade off. You can also do babysitter trades, which are a little bit harder to find. But if you don't have the money for babysitters, find another parent who also is a work at home parent or a stay at home parent. And say you watch their kids for 3 hours on one day, and on another day, you watch their kids for 3 hours. So they can work or they can go grocery shopping. They can go, I don't know, go to the spa. Who knows? And the next one is a mother's helper, which is just the the phrase, dad's helper, whatever you wanna call it.

Kristine Beaves [00:24:19]:
These are teenage people that you can come over and they can do your laundry. They can do your meal prep. They can do all sorts of things. They don't have to watch your kids. You can also you know? And and this one's a bigger one, is drop in day care. Maybe you wanna work out and you wanna work on that health burner. You find a gym that has a daycare, somewhere that you can drop your kids off while you work out. Then Summit obvious ones like after school programs, lessons, summer camps, some way to get your kids out and engaged so that they're not just sitting around while you're working.

Kristine Beaves [00:24:50]:
And on top of all of this, regardless if you have kids or not, if you have a partner or a spouse, if you have family members and friends, ask them for help. You know, they they don't have to help with your kids. They can help with laundry. They can help with dishes. They can do all of the little things around your house. Maybe maybe your mom wants to do grocery shopping for you. Fantastic. As an example of thinking creatively, in order to get this video done for the summit, I am currently recording this in my car.

Kristine Beaves [00:25:21]:
I have my Blue Yeti microphone on my steering wheel, and I'm talking to you guys. And why did I do this? Because I have kids, and even though I try very hard to find time to do what I need to do with my kids around, filming a long video and expecting my kids not to disturb me, Not really reality for me. So my husband is at home watching my kids while I sit in my car looking at a beautiful landscape where it's quiet and recording a video. Think outside the box. No. This is not glorious. This isn't this is not something that I picture when I picture successful bloggers doing their thing. And you know what? I enjoy working in my car.

Kristine Beaves [00:26:10]:
It's quiet. I can go anywhere that I want, but it's also unusual. And that's because I have challenges at home, so I do workarounds to make it work and get my job done. Think creatively. And, again, these are not things that you have to do to actually make progress on your goals. It's finding that time and that brain space to actually work on getting the time to do those goals. That was pretty long, so let's let's just move on. Now let's talk a little bit about time management.

Kristine Beaves [00:26:42]:
Now there's this amazing system called time blocks where you create a schedule and you block out your time throughout the day. And you can get down into the nitty gritty, and we'll get into that in a minute. But, basically, all you need to do is take your your daily schedule for every day of the week and figure out when you're gonna work on things. Now I won't go through this whole thing, but just for example, you maybe this is an example with someone who has a day job. So you you wake up, you do your breakfast, you have an hour to get ready and do your breakfast, and then you go to work. And then when you get home from work at 5 PM, you would spend 30 minutes with your partner. And then later on, after you've, you know, called a friend because you wanna do that social burner, you've cleaned because who wants to live in a dirty house, at 7:30 at night, you have 2 dedicated hours to work on your blog. And then, of course, you wanna take some time afterwards to take care of yourself.

Kristine Beaves [00:27:37]:
Some call it, quote, unquote, self care. I call it self respect. Respect yourself enough to take care of yourself. And then you go to sleep at 10. This is merely allowing yourself to have dedicated time to focus on one part of your life, one burner. And the next thing we're gonna get into is so you can do this very high level. You do not have to get into this nitty gritty. You know, I'm a data person.

Kristine Beaves [00:28:01]:
I love organization. So the next thing you can do is so you have your time blocks, which are like your buckets. But then what do you fill those buckets with? You can get down into time boxes, and this is setting a time limit on every task that you do. And this can get pretty laborious depending on how, in detail you get about this, but so you can say maybe you have 10 minutes or 20 minutes on your lunch break or maybe while your child naps, and you can break up, say, that hour. And say Right 10 minutes, I'm gonna work on social media updates. I'm gonna respond to blog comments. Or maybe you have 45 minutes. You can plan out a week of social media.

Kristine Beaves [00:28:42]:
You can write a blog post. Doing this and actually setting a timer is going to absolutely increase your productivity and your focus. You know when you go and, you know, a lot of you have this on your own blogs, but if there is a time limit say there's a countdown timer on a product offer on a website, and you have 10 minutes to decide whether or not you wanna take advantage of that deal. What does that do? It makes you focus on what the offer is to see if it's something you wanna take advantage of because you only have 10 minutes to decide. It focuses your mind and your energies on what is in front of you. So it's the same exact thing with a a timer. You get a little timer. Everyone has them on their smartphones, and you'd have a timer for how long you wanna spend on things.

Kristine Beaves [00:29:31]:
So if you only have 10 minutes to do social media updates, that means you get to avoid shiny syndrome. We all have this, especially as bloggers in the digital world. Shiny syndrome is a huge time management problem. As you're scrolling through your Facebook feed or trying to go to your social share threads, It's amazing how much time you can waste going down the rabbit hole of, oh, this is an amazing article. Oh, that's an amazing article. I wanna read that too. That's not what you're doing. You're supposed to be going in there and sharing your latest blog post on a share thread and then resharing whatever that share thread rules are.

Kristine Beaves [00:30:13]:
But is that what you're actually doing? A lot of the time it's not. So if you have that timer in your face saying you have 10 minutes to complete a share thread or your share your social updates, You are gonna focus 100% on completing that task. And this this is an amazing system, and you do not have to get into the nitty gritty of every single little detail. But setting that timer is really gonna help you balance everything, and this does not have to be blogging specific. This can be you know, we talked earlier about wanting to spend an hour of dedicated time with your kids. So you can set a timer for that. You'll know that for that 1 hour, you are 100% focused on your kids, or you have a half an hour to make a phone call with your friend. Now it might be kind of rude to have a conversation after 30 minutes when you hear a buzzer go off, but you get what I'm saying.

Kristine Beaves [00:31:04]:
Backtracking a little bit. So we've talked about your time management. We've talked about setting goals, but we all know that all of our tasks that we do every single day are completely beyond our pain points. Our pain points aren't the only thing that we have to work on every single day. So this is more about making your pain points your priority and to fix them to make a more fulfilling day to day, but there are gonna be those tasks that you need to work on that are not around your pain points. Basically, the easiest way to do this is, say, every Sunday. Right after you set your schedule with your for time management and you set your time blocks. Excuse me.

Kristine Beaves [00:31:44]:
Set aside some time, maybe on a Sunday, to plan out your week. Re-evaluate your priorities and your goals. Are they where they where they should be? Do you need to change any of them? Are there priorities or goals that you need to add that aren't related to your pain points? All I'm asking for you is to prioritize you as a whole person before focusing on anything else. Let's recap. You want to define your priorities based on your pain points, and then you can add more underneath that, because once you fix those pain points, that's when you're gonna be able to have clarity. You're gonna free yourself up to focus on the things that you think really matter. You know, you you need to send out your email updates. You need to spend time with your kids.

Kristine Beaves [00:32:28]:
But in order to do that, if you have these nagging thoughts in the back of your head of things that are really bothering you, that are challenging you, you're gonna be multitasking at all times, basically, in your head, stressing about things. So focus on your pain points and then work on other things. And of course, set goals from those priorities and make sure they're measurable, realistic, and actionable. And then, of course, create your plan around those goals. You're gonna wanna make sure that your goals are within your plan, those actionable items that we talked about, creating those steps to reach your goal. You know, the example was make $100 from your blog in 3 weeks. You wanna make sure that every step to reach there is within your plan. So within those time blocks, you can also use the time boxes, so the little nitty gritty ones.

Kristine Beaves [00:33:19]:
You can use those to define how long you have to work on each part to reach your goals. I am an organization nerd as I've mentioned, so I have a my blog workbook. It's completely free. You can either print it out or you can actually type in into the forms there. It's fillable, and it it covers pretty much everything that you could need. You can track all your affiliate programs. You can track your logins. There's checklists for SEO, checklists for posts.

Kristine Beaves [00:33:49]:
There's scheduling. It has pretty much everything you need to track your blog. And the reason why I think this is such a good tool for you to download is because getting things out of your head and onto paper, whether it's digital paper or physical paper, means you have a quick reference. Going back to the time management, constantly having to search for files on your computer or trying to remember what the hex values are for your colors. If you added up all the time you spent searching for things, you would be amazed. Use this workbook to track everything. I do mine in spreadsheets and within printables as well. I just realized how much time I was spending searching for my brand colors or you know, I changed my entire file structure.

Kristine Beaves [00:34:44]:
I I do sell an actual file structure that you can use so you don't lose a file. I sell those in my shop. Get organized, build a plan, and reach your goals. One thing that I do wanna stress is we've already gone through this, so you wanna define your pain points, focus on what truly matters, which is you. You are the one that matters, which why I tell you to focus on your pain points. What are you struggling with? What's stressing you out? Plan smart. Go find ways to develop a plan that eliminates or at least lessens those pain points so you can focus on the things that you need to actually grow your blog or have a a more fulfilling friendship with your friends or spend more time with your kids and actually make those changes. A lot of us have a very hard time making changes because we fear failure, and failure just means something doesn't work.

Kristine Beaves [00:35:43]:
Failures are amazing indicators of exactly what you need to change. See them as a positive thing. If you try some of these methods that I've just talked about and they don't work, try something else. What works for you is gonna be different for than what works for other people. Failures are golden. You if you send out an email blast and you wanna make sales and you don't make any, okay. You didn't make any sales. That sucks.

Kristine Beaves [00:36:15]:
But what can you change to make it happen next time? And the other thing I will mention is you can build all the plans that you can. You can schedule in time blocks all over the place, but I'm gonna stress this. Shit happens. You're going to fall behind. Things aren't going to happen, and you're not not gonna reach your goals. Now this isn't to discourage you. It's only to say that you're going to get sick. Your kids are gonna get sick.

Kristine Beaves [00:36:47]:
You're gonna have a family emergency. There's something is gonna come up. Your car breaks down. You blow a tire. You're you need to replace your fence. You know, there's gonna be financial things that come up. Shit is going to happen. Don't see those as a failure.

Kristine Beaves [00:37:06]:
Some of those it's it's not even a failure. It's basically just a a it's something that's causing you to derail for a minute. But get yourself back on course. Maybe you wanna double down the next week that you you maybe 1 week, your kids got sick, and you couldn't complete your the blog post you wanted. So the next week, you can maybe do 2 blog posts, but you make sure that one of them is maybe a roundup, which is super easy, and your other one is the your whole content blog post. Just move with it. Failure is good. Test out what works and move on.

Kristine Beaves [00:37:43]:
Alright. There was so much more that I wanted to talk to you guys about, but my time is limited, and I've tried to really make sure that the things that I talked about were actually related to my topic. I hope you enjoyed my fun little analogies. I hope they help you kinda get outside your head and really think about where you are in your life, and I hope you enjoy the summit.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:03]:
Right, Kristine. Thank you so much for all that amazing, advice and information. Definitely have a a lot to think about in terms of adjusting the way I do things, so thank you.

Kristine Beaves [00:38:14]:
Mhmm. You're welcome.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:15]:
So I know you do have a free resource for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?

Kristine Beaves [00:38:20]:
So like I said in the video, I have a free resource called the my blog workbook. And it's basically a way to get everything organized for your blogs from your, a list of your affiliates, your login details, it's got checklists if you're brand new to blogging, checklists for SEO, for your blog posts. It's really to help you because the reason that I gave this away as a as a resource and made it possible for everyone to download it is that to get all those details out of your head and onto paper, even if it's digital paper, is to get it out of your head and have less to worry about. You don't have to look for your values, for your colors, and all that. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted looking for things. So it's just a added benefit of getting extra organized so you can save even more time and be more efficient.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:07]:
Yes. I, I can relate so hard to looking at the hex codes. I used to Canva, then I, like, stopped using Canva. So now I have them as, like, a text short code, but past time, I forget that I have them as tech.

Kristine Beaves [00:39:18]:
I even have them on a little post it on my computer because I I hear them all the time.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:22]:
Yeah. Alright. Well, everyone should go grab that. Christine, thank you so much for for doing this. I really appreciate you taking the time, your generosity, so thank you.

Kristine Beaves [00:39:32]:
Of course. And if if anyone needs anything, I'll be in the Facebook group. So feel free to ask any questions and I'll be there.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:38]:
Alright. Awesome, guys. Definitely take advantage of that that generous offer. So thank you again and, we'll catch you at the next session. Alright.

Kristine Beaves [00:39:45]:
Thank you very much.
