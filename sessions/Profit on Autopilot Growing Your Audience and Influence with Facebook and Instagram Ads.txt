I'm super excited to welcome back, Monica Louie. Monica, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:39.480] - Monica Louie
Hey, thank you so much for having me. I'm honored to be asked to come back.

[00:00:43.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, and I'm always excited to I like to talk about ads because it's something that I've always dabbled it in the past, but I've never really successfully done. I've never kept doing, which is probably why it's never been successfully done for me. But it is such a great way to How to keep things going. So at what point, at what point should people start looking at ads, doing ads for themselves?

[00:01:08.820] - Monica Louie
Sure. Yeah. So there are a lot of things that we can accomplish with ads. It's main purpose is for driving traffic. And so that could mean to grow your email list, to offer your free lead magnet. It can mean to drive traffic to your paid offers. Or for us bloggers, it can just mean that we're driving traffic to get more eyes on our latest blog So whatever your goals are, you can find a way potentially to use ads to help get more eyes on your offers and your content. So when it comes to deciding if you're ready to run ads, it really is a matter of, do you have a small marketing budget that you can use consistently toward running ads? And so if you do and you have the bandwidth to dive in and learn how to create the ads, then I would recommend, if it aligns with your goals, to do any of those things that I mentioned, that you can explore it and see if it makes sense to do right now.

[00:02:04.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So eventually, I mean, ideally, ads shouldn't just be costing you money. They should be producing a result. Ideally, a result that pays for the ads. But obviously, it's not instantaneous. How long should it take to start seeing a potential profit from ads? Whether that's through your audience growth, I mean, it depends on your goal, I guess. But you can give us some examples of depending on how long it might take.

[00:02:32.280] - Monica Louie
Absolutely. Yeah. And so when it comes to ads, I mean, I have clients that come to me that we work with who their main goal is just brand awareness. They want to be the go to name. They're not necessarily, maybe through their business model, they don't have their own product to sell. But their goal with running ads is that they just want more brand awareness. They want their audience to think of them when it comes time to need their resource. So it could be anywhere from brand awareness all the way through getting that ROI, which that's where most of us think of, and that's a beautiful thing when we got that running. So if that is your goal, and for many people, that's the end goal when it comes to running ads, then we want to think through, Okay, am I ready to run ads? Will this actually give me an ROI? Do I have a funnel or a path to profit that converts. And then if you do and it's successful for you with your organic audience, then that means it's a good time to test running it with ads to both your warm audiences, also opening up to a larger cold audience that you can reach through the power of ads.

[00:03:35.410] - Monica Louie
So as far as how long it can take, it really depends on the conversion rate of your funnel that you have in place. And to see, we like to dive in when we're looking at, does it make sense for us to work with a potential client? What are the conversion rates of their funnel? What are the conversion rates of their landing pages, their sales pages? Looking at how many leads did they bring in through their funnel last month? And then how many sales did they make from that? And then does the math make sense with what we think where we can get their cost per lead ad and where we might be able to, over time, improve that conversion rate by dialing in on that ideal audience? So we like to look at the math and see it doesn't make sense. Do we think that our costs are low enough as far as the cost per lead and driving traffic into the funnel where it'll make sense to get that ROI and there's that ROI potential? So I would suggest that people look at those numbers, really understand what your numbers are, how many people join your email list last month, how many people ended up converting to your paid offer.

[00:04:40.410] - Monica Louie
If you have one core offer, how many sales did you make last month? Then Just seeing as a baseline what that conversion rate is, and then seeing if you can scale that up. It's always a good idea, though, for ads to be growing your email list. That's one of the evergreen strategies that I always think is a good idea for business owners to have going on in the background. You can do a low ad spend, just keep it going, bringing new people into your email list, into your world. You have the chance to build a relationship with them so that next time you have your big launch or your special sale or something, then you're growing that audience on a consistent basis and they're ready to buy.

[00:05:18.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that. So a couple of... I want to touch on a few things you mentioned. So you talked about as you zero in on your ideal audience. I will say when I've tried to... When I've set up ads in the past, that's been the biggest struggle is figuring out the audience for the ad. So do you have any tips on that and then tips on from where you start and how you hone in?

[00:05:39.940] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So thinking through the goal of the campaign and what the offer is. So if we have a flash sale where we have a limited time promotion, it's 20 % off our core offer, and we just want to make sure that our warm audience sees this. We're emailing and we're posting on social, but we also want to put some money behind getting those ads and that offer in front of our warm audience, then that's where I would say, let's just solely focus on the warm audience for that case. If it's like an evergreen strategy where we've got the evergreen funnel where we want to grow our email list and our audience at the same time as me getting that ROI and having sales come out at the end of the funnel. Then I like to test warm audiences and cold audiences together. The warm audiences will likely convert sooner, especially depending on the price point of the product. But the cold audiences can really open you up, and you can bring in a much lower cost per lead, usually, since the cold audiences are going to be here in the US, potentially millions of people that could be your ideal audience.

[00:06:49.790] - Monica Louie
And when it comes to testing the cold audiences, there are three total different types of audiences that we can target. So we have the warm audiences, which are the people that are already familiar with us. When you got the pixel placed on your website, then it's the website visitors. You can target your email list if it makes sense to your strategy. But then also your followers and people who engage with you on Facebook and Instagram, you can create audiences around those. So that would be the warm audience. For the cold audience, then we have the detail targeting option, which is where we can say, Here's some keywords and some interests that our audience is likely interested in. There's a bunch of different demographics and different things that you can drill down in when creating that audience. So definitely look and see what might be relevant to your core or audience. But then also my favorite type of audience is the lookalike audience. And that's where we can take any of our warm audiences. So let's say we've got a list of customers. So long as you have 100 people on that list and you say, Facebook, these are my ideal customers, and I want to find more people like them, then we can upload that list into the Ads Manager, into the Audience screen, and it'll match those profiles.

[00:08:03.660] - Monica Louie
And then we can say, Okay, find me more people like that. And that's called a lookalike audience. And so lookalike audiences, time and time again, are some of our best performing audiences. So when it comes to testing cold audiences, we like to test multiple different types of the lookalike audiences, and then also a couple of the detail targeting audiences where we're drilling down into those specific interests and demographics.

[00:08:25.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that. Then a couple more things. You mentioned, hopefully, you get it going, you have low ad spend in the background. What do you consider low ad spend? I feel like that could mean different amounts to different people.

[00:08:38.680] - Monica Louie
Yes. Yeah, no, that's a great question. So when just starting out with ads, and through my program, I teach getting started with ads at five or $10 per day per ad audience combination. So you have the multiple different audiences that you can test. And then there are many different ad formats and different types of ads that you can test as well. So for Each ad-audience combination, depending on your goal, I like to start those at five or $10 per day. So if your goal is to drive traffic to your blog post, you can get a lot of results, meaning clicks through to the landing page for very low amounts of money. So that's where I would say $5 is all you need per ad there. If your goal is to grow your email list or drive traffic to your paid product, then I like to have $10 per ad audience combination for those strategies. And that just means that you're going to give the algorithm and the ads manager enough money, enough budget to work with so that it's pushing out the ads and then starting to see those results come in so that it has information that it's getting through that feedback loop of seeing people actually opt in for your freebie or go and click and pay for your product.

[00:09:53.300] - Monica Louie
It gets that feedback loop. So then it's able over time to focus your ads, pushing them out to people who are more likely to either opt in, if that's the goal of the campaign, or purchase your product, if that's the goal of your campaign. So over time, you'll likely see your cost per lead or your cost per purchase decrease as the algorithm gets that data feedback loop.

[00:10:14.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So other thing off of that. So you're talking about opting in on your site and stuff. But I know Facebook has where you can actually do the opt-ins on Facebook, like an ad, so they don't have to leave Facebook. Do you like testing versus this website? Is that something that has worked really well that you've seen? What's your thoughts on that versus driving traffic to a specific place?

[00:10:39.820] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So typically we do like to control the experience of driving traffic to a landing page. And so we'll give our clients feedback on the setup of the landing page. We don't want any distractions on it. We want it to be really simple and straightforward for the freebie. If it's a sales page, obviously, we need more detail there. But for the freebie, if it's a free opt-in, we like to put the details in the ad itself so they know the benefits of the freebie, and then it's just a quick no-brainer, click, opt in on the landing page after they enter their name and email address. So that's typically what we recommend for the lead form that you're talking about. That can be a great, quick, easy way to get your lead ad going. And you can create really quickly and easily the lead form where it can capture the information. It'll autofill with their name and email and whatever information that Facebook has. It'll autofill. And what I've heard is that sometimes those are not as high a quality leads from the lead form as they are when they click and then have to type in their email address on your landing page.

[00:11:45.620] - Monica Louie
Just because it may not be the best email address for them to be reached at for the long term, that might just be their throw away all my spam email goes to that one thing that I use for my logins or whatever. Or they set up Facebook 15 years ago Exactly.

[00:11:59.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And that email address is definitely the case for me if it were. Absolutely.

[00:12:06.550] - Monica Louie
I've heard differing thoughts on this, but generally, I think the cost per lead could be lower for using the lead form. It could be quicker and easier to get that going than having to set up your own landing page. I'll always say it's worth the test. It may work great for you and for your offer and for your audience. It's always worth a test, but I would definitely see if you can notice and pay attention to the activity. Once they do opt in and fill out the lead form, then are they engaging? Are they opening your emails? Are they engaging with your emails at this similar rate to everybody else on your email list? Then you'll know If that's the case, then they're a good quality lead, and you can be happy with that potentially lower lead cost.

[00:12:51.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I want to talk more about testing in a second, but I vaguely recall the last time you were in the summit, you mentioning in terms of how many times someone should see an ad. That's a metric in the ad management and what that should be. And has that gone up? Because it seems like people need to see things like, it used to be seven times, and now it's like 30. So is there a certain point where it's like, well, they've seen it this many times and they still haven't clicked it, turn it off? Or what does that look like these days?

[00:13:25.490] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So that measurement, that metric is called frequency. So it's frequency rate. So when you hit go on your campaigns, you push your ads out, they start spending money, it'll start at one. So that means that the people who've seen the ad have likely seen it one time. Just know it starts at one. It's not going to start below that. So if it's already at one 5 a few days later, 1.3, don't think that it's out of the ordinary. But generally, you're right. So it depends, again, on the offer. So if it's a freebie, most people are like, yes, I want it or no, I don't. And so then it's a matter of audience size. So if you're just showing your freebie to your warm audience, and your warm audience is maybe 10,000 people based on your website visitors, then your frequency rate is going to climb much quicker. And again, also depending on your budget. If you've got a higher budget, then it's going to push the ads out more. Then you may see that you'll start to get the message from Facebook saying, creative fatigue, that people are seeing this ad, they're just not engaging like they used to.

[00:14:24.840] - Monica Louie
So it might be time for you to change it up. But if you're targeting those cold with potentially millions of people, then it's going to take a lot longer for that frequency rate to increase. It will also, again, depend on your budget. If you're doing a higher budget, you'll see it increase probably at a faster rate. But when it comes to going to the sale, when we are running campaigns for launches for our clients, and it's like, We've got five days, and we want everybody to know about the sale or the extra bonuses and all the things, then we'll set that frequency rate in those campaigns for three times a day just because they're We all know as we're scrolling on social media, there might be times where we're just scrolling and not really paying attention. We may have seen the ad. It may have been fed to us, but we didn't really pay attention with it. Then maybe it's like you see it and you're like, Okay, good to know. Then you see it again and you're like, That's interesting. Then you think about it and you're like, Okay, the sales going away. Let me actually see what's going on and make a decision.

[00:15:24.140] - Monica Louie
So yeah, it can take several times. So that's our rule of thumb is three times each day. It doesn't mean that everybody in the audience is going to see it three times per day, but that's the limit that we're saying because we don't want to overwhelm people and really annoy them that they're seeing these ads because I know I've seen, you can tell when people are doing big budgets because you just keep seeing the ads over and over. We don't really want to annoy people, but we also want to meet them where they're at and give them the opportunity to take advantage of the offer when the special offer is happening.

[00:15:53.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like that. I think that's definitely higher than what you said before because that was years ago. Okay, so talking about testing, because you mentioned it a few different times, we talked about testing lead forms on Facebook versus a landing page. How many rounds of testing do you typically see before you land on something that really works well?

[00:16:16.440] - Monica Louie
Yeah, so I love testing. I may have an inclination about, I think this will likely work better than this, but we don't know until we test. So it's always good to test. So I love testing every aspect of it. We'll take a look at the metrics of the landing page if we're promoting a freebie. What is the conversion rate of the landing page? Then we may work with our clients to change it up a little bit if we're seeing that the conversion rate is lower than we'd like it to be, and that could be affecting the cost per lead from our ads. As far as what we test with the ads and the campaigns, we'll test different audiences and then different ads, different versions of the ads, different ad copy, headlines, a graphic versus a video versus a carousel ad, different ad formats. What we'll see is when we start a new campaign, we have in our head where we think, based on working with the client and similar offers, where our cost per lead or cost per purchase should be, what our ROAS, a return on ad spend that we're shooting for. And if we come in lower than that after the first round of testing, then we're like, Okay, well, what are the best performers of this?

[00:17:25.570] - Monica Louie
So we'll test multiple audiences, multiple ads, and then we'll narrow it down. We give a good seven days. And after seven days of running, that gives the algorithm time to adjust and see who's engaging and see who's converting. Then we'll oftentimes have clear winners. So these ads are definitely outperforming these other ones. So We'll turn those off. Or maybe this audience is definitely our best performing audience. The other two, maybe not so much. So we'll pull back on the budget on those audiences a bit, maybe start to increase the budget on the better performer. And then we'll say, Okay, so with those adjustments, should we give a little bit longer or should we test new ads? And so that's where we go, and we just keep iterating for those evergreen campaigns. We will get to a point, though, if we're seeing like, Oh, my gosh, this lead cost or this ROAs is just incredible. We're like, Don't touch it, let it go, and then we'll just continue to slowly scale. And we like to do it slowly by increasing the budget when that happens because we don't want to throw the algorithm off.

[00:18:28.020] - Monica Louie
If we're getting 10 sales per day and we don't want to double the budget because then in order to have that same return, we need to have 20 sales for Facebook to help us find. We want to do it incrementally. Then as far as Evergreen, when we're continuing to test, we'll just consider the time of year. Sometimes we'll have an ad that will be performing great for a few months, and then just peters out a little bit. It's just not performing as great. We'll leave it In the Ads Manager, we have that data we can tap into to say, Well, that was a good performing ad, but maybe at the turn of the year or this next season, we might want to test it again because it did work great for a while, but then we'll test things in between and maybe bring it back and see if it comes to life again in the future.

[00:19:17.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like the seasonality of just everything else, so keeping that in mind. Any final things you want to tell people when it comes to getting started with ads and making them part of your business?

[00:19:32.930] - Monica Louie
Yeah. I think that when it comes to diving into the ads world, it is something that I know can be scary for people, can be intimidating. I know when I first started running ads for myself, I was hoping and praying that it was going to work, that I wasn't just letting my money on fire. And so I would say just start off small. If you're new to ads, start off small, start off with a budget that you can maintain and really focus on actually learning the platform, learning what you can do with ads, what the potential is there. And then I would just say start with one goal. Maybe your goal is to grow your email list. You just want to start there. You know that even if you're testing things and it doesn't work out as well as you want or it's more expensive than you think it should be, but you know that you're growing your email list, so you're getting a good return in that respect, no matter what happens, start with a budget that you can feel good about and not feel stressed about, and then go from there, and then continue to test and devote time to it.

[00:20:32.510] - Monica Louie
It's not set and forget it. But what I do love about ads, as opposed to an organic content strategy with social media, is that you don't have to be on pushing out new things every single day. You can set up your test, let it run, check in on it, and then decide next week, Okay, I'm going to test this thing. And maybe just test one thing at a time rather than testing four different things. Then you won't really know what actually moved the needle if your results are much better, the following week. So I would just say, take your time, but also don't give up too easily. So some people will get frustrated. They're like, okay, I'm all in on ads. And then a couple of weeks, then they're like, it's not working. And they just give up. So start slow, start small, and just go from there. But keep at it, because if you're focused on your goal, you can make it work.

[00:21:24.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, fantastic. And I know you have something for everyone watching. You want to tell us about

[00:21:30.060] - Monica Louie
Yes. So my free Facebook Ad Starter Kit, it's absolutely free, and it walks you through the six simple steps, many of which we've talked about today for planning your ad campaign. And so it starts with what is the goal and what is the strategy? What are the audiences? What is my ad going to look like? And it helps you walk through all of that so that you're ready to go in the Ads Manager. There's also a checklist. I'm a checklist girl. And so I've got a checklist there where you know, worksheet you can fill out where you're mapping all this out so that you're planning ahead of time before you go into the Ads Manager. Then you have it all ready to go, and then you go in and set it up. It also, if there's some of the terms that I've mentioned, you're like, I think I know what that is, but I'm not quite sure. I've got a glossary of key terms since Facebook ads and Instagram ads, the same platform, have language of their own. So I think it's a really helpful resource. I've gotten a lot of great feedback about it, but I think it's a great tool to help get you started with ads.

[00:22:30.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's fantastic. I mean, and clearly I didn't know the language. I was like that thing where they see it and you're like, frequency. So I think that'll be super helpful for people, especially like me. Okay, and I know you also have something for those that decide to upgrade. Can you tell us about that?

[00:22:45.660] - Monica Louie
Yes. Yeah, it's our flourishing ads guide. And so this walks you through the details of putting together a high converting ad. So it has the best tips from my great copywriter of how to write Ad Copy that converts for your different offers, how to draft those headlines, what element should be in the Ad Copy as you're thinking about putting it together. And then also my amazing graphic designer put together tips for how to create those amazing graphics that will catch the attention and help people stop the scroll and click through to see your great offers. And then we've got a lot of different ad examples for different things, different types of offers, lead magnets and paid products, both for or high converting ads. So you can see from my client what have worked well and actually got an amazing result. So lots of examples. If you're looking for some inspiration, you can find it in the Ads Guide.

[00:23:40.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. So definitely go check out that freebie she has for you guys to get started. That's definitely link below on the page. And if that getting started ad guide sounds like that, Hey, I want that, too, then make sure you upgrade. Monica, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and coming back. I know I learned a lot and sure everyone else watching did, too.

[00:24:00.010] - Monica Louie
Right. Thank you so much.
