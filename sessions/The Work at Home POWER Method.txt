Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright guys, today we're here with Brianna from Spiked Parenting. Thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.

Brianna Berner [00:00:05]:
Welcome, of course.

Brianna Berner [00:00:07]:
Thanks so much for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:09]:
Yeah, because you know, as bloggers, we always tend to, you know, we, we aim for that like full time blogging goal and I mean, I'm, I'm full time self employed now.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:21]:
I that happened, you know, you're a.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:24]:
Couple years after I started my blog, but it's a whole nother shift to working at home. I was fortunate that my nine to five actually was home based. So I had that kind of experience and figured out a lot of stuff, but I still had a learning curve in certain things. So I'm excited for your session.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:40]:
We're going to be talking about being.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:
More productive at home, is that correct?

Brianna Berner [00:00:44]:
Yeah, absolutely. And I find that that's one of the main things that so many people struggle with because we look at everything we want to do and then try to cram it all in without a game plan on how to actually get it done. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:59]:
And then you run into things of like, yes, I really want to get.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:03]:
This done, but it's kind of hard.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:06]:
So I'm going to procrastinate by doing the dishes or the laundry or like your house is never more clean than when you're procrastinating some form of work.

Brianna Berner [00:01:14]:
Absolutely. Procrastinate cleaning you're like, I'm being productive.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:22]:
Yeah, it makes a difference.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:24]:
So can you give us a little.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:25]:
Bit sort of about your background, how you got to helping people with this and then highlight what we're going to.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:30]:
Learn in your presentation?

Brianna Berner [00:01:32]:
Absolutely. So I am a professional organizer and a productivity coach. And a lot of the people that I've worked with over the past three years or so doing this are busy moms, stay at home moms, work at home moms, who are maybe they're trying to work with the kids still there, or they have 2 hours of free time and trying to figure out what they can do during that time period. So I've really just fine tuned everything that I do to accommodate that. One of the main things that we're going to be talking about in my presentation is always being intentional with that time, always knowing exactly what you're going to be working on every single time you sit down to work. Because you have an hour and a half to get something done. You spend half an hour of that figuring out what you're going to be working on. You've just lost so much time. So it just comes down to planning ahead and being prepared and planning for the different distractions and stuff that are going to be pulling you away and having a game plan so they don't interrupt your productivity day in, day out.

Brianna Berner [00:02:41]:
Over and over again so you can.

Brianna Berner [00:02:43]:
Get more done while you're working from home.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:45]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:45]:
And I can relate to this so hard because I live by myself. All my time was my own apart from my dog whining at me to go out.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:54]:
And then I moved to family.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:57]:
And now I'm like because my sister and brother in law work really early, so I do the kids in the morning. I pick my nephew up after preschool, so he's only gone I've got like 3 hours between dropping him off and him being home. And then there's the lawn guys and I'm watching him. And so I went from all the time in the world to like, this is the lessons I've had to learn this past year. So I'm really excited for your session.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:22]:
I'm sure I'm going to learn more.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:23]:
Because I've just been kind of fumbling figuring it out.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:26]:
So let's dig into this.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:28]:
I'm really excited.

Brianna Berner [00:03:29]:
All right, sounds great.

Brianna Berner [00:03:32]:
Okay, so today I'm going to walk you through the work at home Power method, which is my signature method to help you boost your productivity while working from home so you can truly unleash your potential onto the world. Because while working from home may be the dream, finding ways to stay productive can be challenging. I mean, if I don't feel like doing something, there's always something else that can easily distract me. Laundry, cleaning, Netflix, my cat. And I am absolutely a Procrastinative cleaner or Procrastinate napper when I have too.

Brianna Berner [00:04:06]:
Much on my plate.

Brianna Berner [00:04:07]:
And when that's the case, it's incredibly important to have some structure in place from allowing those things to take over your day. And even if you only have small pockets of time to work with, maybe your kids are home with you or you have other obligations throughout the day, it's still totally possible to get a lot done. My son was home with me during the day for about a year while I was building my business, which left me about 2 hours during the day to work while he napped, if he napped. And using just that time, I was able to create a massive 100 plus video online course in less than two months. On top of pushing out weekly blog posts, writing all of my emails, and all of the other stuff that I had to do to keep my business going. And I'm not telling you this to give myself a massive ego boost. I'm telling you this to prove that it's entirely possible to get a ridiculous amount of stuff done during the day, regardless of whether you have 2 hours.

Brianna Berner [00:05:07]:
Or eight, you just have to have.

Brianna Berner [00:05:09]:
A solid strategy in place. And today I'm going to give you the exact strategy that I use and the exact strategy that I teach my clients and students to really shoot their productivity through the roof. And it's my work at home Power method.

Brianna Berner [00:05:27]:
So my work at home Power method.

Brianna Berner [00:05:30]:
Is broken down into five parts.

Brianna Berner [00:05:32]:
So P is for planning ahead.

Brianna Berner [00:05:35]:
And this really is the most important part of the method and everything else builds off of this. Because if you only have 2 hours to work, you need to know exactly what you need to work on the minute you sit down. Even if you have 8 hours to work, you don't want to spend a.

Brianna Berner [00:05:52]:
Portion of that wasting time that you.

Brianna Berner [00:05:55]:
Could easily avoid in the first place. And planning ahead is how you get that done. O is for organization because let's face.

Brianna Berner [00:06:04]:
It, you're going to get so much.

Brianna Berner [00:06:06]:
More done each day if you're organized. And I'm not just talking about organizing your pens and paperclips so that they look pretty. I'm talking about setting up some systems in your home office to keep things moving and prevent wasted time. I'm also talking about organizing the different tasks that you need to get done, as well as everything on your to do list. So again, you always know exactly what you need to do when you sit down to work. W is for white space, then, because life's messy. And if you plan out every second of your day and then something happens, your entire day is going to be.

Brianna Berner [00:06:45]:
Thrown off no matter how organized you are.

Brianna Berner [00:06:48]:
And scheduling in plenty of white space throughout your day gives you the buffer you need to stay on track. And while I know that may sound counterintuitive, that flexibility is one of the key components to a highly productive day. E is for engagement because you have to be fully engaged with what you're working on. You can't split your attention between 50 different things and expect to get stuff done. You have to methodically and strategically work through things and you'll start seeing those little wins throughout the day. And I promise you, those feel so amazing. And then finally, R is for reflect and refine because no system will ever be perfect. And if you continuously improve what you're doing and refine it until it fits you and your lifestyle, you're only going to become more and more efficient over time. So let's take a look at each of these and how you can apply them to your life today to start seeing immediate results.

Brianna Berner [00:07:51]:
Okay, so the first step of the.

Brianna Berner [00:07:54]:
Work at home power method is planning ahead. You need to have a game plan for your day so that you can keep moving. Because Netflix and Cat snuggles are a lot more enticing when you don't really know what you should be doing in.

Brianna Berner [00:08:08]:
The first place, or when you look.

Brianna Berner [00:08:10]:
At everything you have to do and get totally overwhelmed.

Brianna Berner [00:08:14]:
So to start, you have to look.

Brianna Berner [00:08:16]:
At how much working time you have. Are you working from home from eight to five? Or maybe just from nine to twelve while your daughter's in preschool? Or maybe you just have that magical time from twelve to two while your son's napping to get stuff done. Whatever the case may be, write down what your working hours are.

Brianna Berner [00:08:35]:
Next, ask yourself when you have the.

Brianna Berner [00:08:38]:
Most energy during that time. Personally, I have the most energy during the morning, so I want to schedule in things that take the most brain power during that time. My low energy times are in the afternoon, so I schedule in things that don't take as much concentration during that time. And the reason you want to do this is so that you're working on the most difficult tasks while your brain is cooperating with you. This way, you're less likely to make mistakes which are more time consuming and.

Brianna Berner [00:09:09]:
Costly to fix after the fact.

Brianna Berner [00:09:11]:
And attacking those tedious and more difficult things on your to do list with full brain power makes it less likely that you'll make as many mistakes. It also makes it less likely that you'll do subpar work, which again, will just waste even more time when you have to go in and fix everything or completely redo it because it just wasn't up to your normal standards. It also prevents you from just scrapping the working time altogether because you're just not feeling it. Because those high energy tasks that you probably love doing are a lot less appealing when you're running on no energy. So you want to plan out your day with your energy in mind.

Brianna Berner [00:09:53]:
The next step then, is to create.

Brianna Berner [00:09:56]:
Time blocks during your working hours with your energy levels in mind. So, for example, since I have the most energy in the morning, I schedule two time blocks in the morning to work on my various high energy tasks. And I schedule them from nine to 1030 and eleven to 1230. Leaving time before and in between to take a break or deal with any small things that I need to knock off my to do list. Then I'll schedule two lower energy time blocks into my afternoon. The first is from one to 230.

Brianna Berner [00:10:30]:
The second from three to 430, and.

Brianna Berner [00:10:33]:
Then I pull whatever tasks I need to finish from my to do list and schedule them in during those times.

Brianna Berner [00:10:40]:
Now, if you have less time to.

Brianna Berner [00:10:42]:
Work during the day, time blocking is still totally possible. You'll just get fewer blocks of time.

Brianna Berner [00:10:47]:
To work on stuff.

Brianna Berner [00:10:49]:
For example, maybe you only have one time block in the morning and one.

Brianna Berner [00:10:54]:
Later at night once the kids are asleep.

Brianna Berner [00:10:56]:
For me personally, that morning time block would be my high energy time, and the one in the evening would be my low energy one. But I know myself well enough to only schedule in very low energy stuff that late in the day, because my brain just isn't working at that time. The important thing here, though, is that no matter how many time blocks you have, that it's still super important to physically schedule in what you're going to be working on so you don't waste.

Brianna Berner [00:11:25]:
Any time, and you do that by.

Brianna Berner [00:11:27]:
Getting yourself a little organized. So the next step to the work at home power method then is organization.

Brianna Berner [00:11:35]:
So in order to get the most.

Brianna Berner [00:11:38]:
Out of your day when you're working at home, you have to be organized and you have to have some killer systems in place.

Brianna Berner [00:11:44]:
So the first thing that you need.

Brianna Berner [00:11:46]:
To do is take some time to organize your space, because you don't want to waste 20 minutes cleaning off your desk or work area every time you.

Brianna Berner [00:11:54]:
Sit down to work.

Brianna Berner [00:11:56]:
So take a look at everything that tends to find its way to your desk. And then get rid of what you don't need and find a permanent home for everything else. Look at the stuff you're throwing away. Try to see if there's a way you can stop it from coming into your home in the first place.

Brianna Berner [00:12:12]:
For example, if it's a bunch of.

Brianna Berner [00:12:15]:
Junk mail that always takes over your desk, go to CatalogChoice.org and pull yourself off the different mailing list. Then set up a system for taking care of stuff as it comes in. Set up a shred zone that you always have access to and shred everything that you can the second that it comes into your space. Get a hanging file holder to organize the paperwork that you need regular access.

Brianna Berner [00:12:39]:
To and the stuff that you need.

Brianna Berner [00:12:41]:
To take care of, like bills and school forms. Go paperless if you can.

Brianna Berner [00:12:46]:
The point is to set up systems.

Brianna Berner [00:12:49]:
To prevent you and your family from just dumping stuff in your office by creating places for everything to go. Then get in the habit of putting stuff away rather than just tossing it wherever. Because it really only takes a couple of seconds to put something away if you have a place to put it. And if you catch yourself saying that you'll just do it later, then remind yourself that it only takes 2 seconds and it'll make your life so much easier. Stay on top of it and it will eventually just become second nature to put things away right away. Next, you need to organize your workflow and your to do list so that you always know exactly what you're going to be working on when you sit down to work. So the first thing that you need to do is trim the unnecessary things from your to do list. Because an overflowing to do list just leads to overwhelm and feeling inadequate when you never cross everything off. So set yourself up to win by only having stuff on there that you actually have to do. So take a look at your to do list. First, pinpoint the different things that you're constantly skipping over or ignoring. Think about the different things that always seem to be on your to do list that never get crossed off.

Brianna Berner [00:14:04]:
Now take a minute to ask yourself.

Brianna Berner [00:14:07]:
Why you keep skipping them. Is it something you don't like doing? Is it just not important? Or maybe it is important, you just haven't found the time to actually do it. If things are constantly getting skipped over, you need to either make time for it, have someone else do it, automate.

Brianna Berner [00:14:25]:
It, or just take it off your.

Brianna Berner [00:14:26]:
To do list altogether. If it is something important, then take a second and schedule in a day and time to actually get it done. Things that are important but not necessarily urgent, like they don't have a hard due date, can easily get skipped over, but it's important to get them done, so schedule them in. If it isn't important, you should probably take it off your list because you should only be focusing your time and energy on projects that are aligned with your values, your vision and your aspirations, and the normal day to day tasks that keep your family and your business going. So next we need to set up some systems. And systems are incredibly important to have because they save you a lot of time by streamlining the way you do certain things. So, to figure out what sort of systems you can implement, you need to look at how you typically spend your day and then pinpoint any areas where you're spending way too much time. Are there certain tasks that just seem to take forever to complete? Or maybe certain things that you just dread doing? If you're spending too much time on something, you need to either create a system to streamline it or find a way to automate at least part of it. Another good place to set up some systems is to look at the different things that you do the same way over and over again. Now, hopefully you're already doing these things the same way every time, and if you aren't, then you should be. Because when you do things the same way every time, you begin to develop a rhythm or a pattern. And as you continue to do it this way, you naturally begin to work through it faster. So take a look at the different things on your to do list, pinpoint the tasks that you tend to do a lot or that just take way too long to do, and set up a standard way to always do them.

Brianna Berner [00:16:18]:
Okay, so now that we've trimmed what.

Brianna Berner [00:16:21]:
We can off of your to do list, we need to organize what's left, which may help you knock a few more things off as well. And the purpose of doing this is so that whenever you sit down to work, you again always know exactly what you need to work on. This is incredibly important because it prevents you from wasting time trying to figure that out in the moment.

Brianna Berner [00:16:42]:
Because think about it, if every single.

Brianna Berner [00:16:45]:
Time you sit down to work you wasted five or ten minutes deciding what to do, you're not going to get as much done. And all that wasted time really adds up throughout the week.

Brianna Berner [00:16:56]:
But if you spend a few minutes.

Brianna Berner [00:16:58]:
Here and there making sure that your to do list is prepped, you'll be able to get more done.

Brianna Berner [00:17:03]:
So the first thing that we need.

Brianna Berner [00:17:05]:
To do is organize the different tasks on your list.

Brianna Berner [00:17:08]:
So break your to do list down.

Brianna Berner [00:17:11]:
Into high and low energy tasks. If you're a work at home mom, you can create a third list of things you can do while the kids are around and climbing all over you or if you have a job outside of the house as well.

Brianna Berner [00:17:23]:
You can create a third list of things that you can do while you're.

Brianna Berner [00:17:26]:
On your breaks or during other downtime. And what you consider a high energy task will completely depend on the things that take you a lot of brain power to work on. And what you consider low energy will be those things that you can kind of do on autopilot.

Brianna Berner [00:17:43]:
So next, you need to prioritize the.

Brianna Berner [00:17:46]:
Tasks on each list. Put things that are urgent and important.

Brianna Berner [00:17:51]:
First, then things that are important but.

Brianna Berner [00:17:53]:
Not really urgent, then things that are urgent but not really important, and finally the things that are neither urgent nor important.

Brianna Berner [00:18:02]:
And honestly, take a little time while.

Brianna Berner [00:18:04]:
You're doing this to consider whether the.

Brianna Berner [00:18:06]:
Things that aren't important even need to.

Brianna Berner [00:18:09]:
Be on your to do list. And if they don't, then get rid of them. So, like I said earlier, you're going to want to knock things off your high energy list when you have the.

Brianna Berner [00:18:18]:
Brain power to do so.

Brianna Berner [00:18:20]:
And you're going to want to work on the low energy tasks when you would rather be sitting on your couch binging on Netflix with a pint of ice cream. Understanding your energy cycles and your own circadian rhythm is essential for this. So pay attention to the times throughout the day when you normally have a lot of energy and the times when you're pretty wiped out. And ultimately you want to try to plan out your day so that you schedule in the important stuff. So look at the high energy time blocks you created and then schedule in the first task on your prioritized high energy list. Don't put more than one thing. Worst case, if you get that done, then you can just start on that next task.

Brianna Berner [00:19:02]:
Then if you have an unexpected 30.

Brianna Berner [00:19:05]:
Minutes to work on something, grab the next thing off that list. This way, you always know exactly what you need to work on when you.

Brianna Berner [00:19:12]:
Sit down to work and you want.

Brianna Berner [00:19:14]:
To do the same thing with low energy tasks, doing this is going to.

Brianna Berner [00:19:18]:
Save you a lot of time and.

Brianna Berner [00:19:20]:
Really help you get so much more done.

Brianna Berner [00:19:24]:
Okay, so the next step of the.

Brianna Berner [00:19:26]:
Power method is white space.

Brianna Berner [00:19:28]:
And this step is absolutely crucial because.

Brianna Berner [00:19:32]:
If you plan out every second of your day, you're always going to be stressed out when things don't go according to plan.

Brianna Berner [00:19:40]:
For example, let's say that you schedule.

Brianna Berner [00:19:43]:
Three time blocks in your morning, one from nine to ten, one from ten to eleven, and one from eleven to twelve. And you schedule in one task to work on during each of these times. You're probably going to be super pumped that you'll get all of that done in one morning, right? Well, your son dumps cheerios all over himself right as you're about to walk out the door. So you have to run upstairs and.

Brianna Berner [00:20:06]:
Change him, making you 15 minutes late. So does that 15 minutes come from.

Brianna Berner [00:20:12]:
That first time block?

Brianna Berner [00:20:13]:
Does that only leave you then with.

Brianna Berner [00:20:16]:
45 minutes to complete whatever it was that you had scheduled in? The other option is to start the next block 15 minutes late. Well, at 1030, you get an email from a client and you have to fix something right away. Where does that time come from? Your 10:00 block, your 11:00 block? And what happens to the stuff that you scheduled in during those times? Well, more than likely, they don't get done. Your morning shot, you got maybe half of the stuff done that you had.

Brianna Berner [00:20:45]:
Planned and you're bumped you're in a.

Brianna Berner [00:20:47]:
Bad mood for the rest of the day.

Brianna Berner [00:20:49]:
As a result, to avoid this, you.

Brianna Berner [00:20:51]:
Want to schedule white space into your day. And what I mean here is that you want to leave empty space between your different time blocks, client calls, and whatnot to accommodate all of the unexpected things that more than likely will happen. This way, you have a little wiggle room.

Brianna Berner [00:21:08]:
If something comes up, if it's something.

Brianna Berner [00:21:11]:
Quick, you can take care of it during your breaks. If it's going to take longer, you can use that time to schedule it in so that you know it'll get done. Rearranging your schedule if needed. So the next step of the work at home power method is engagement. In order to be productive during the day, you have to be engaged with what you're doing. You can't focus on 50 things at once. You need to engage with one thing at a time. See, as entrepreneurs, we're ideas people and we're passionate. So it's really easy for us to get super passionate about all of our amazing ideas. But think about it, if you're spreading all of your energy between 50 different amazing ideas, then each can only get about 2% of your time.

Brianna Berner [00:21:57]:
But if you take the time to.

Brianna Berner [00:21:59]:
Pinpoint the exact things that you need to focus on and then methodically work through them, then those things will get 100% of your time. So if you're working on two or three or four projects at once and you're jumping back and forth between them, it's taking you a lot longer to.

Brianna Berner [00:22:16]:
Finish them than it should.

Brianna Berner [00:22:18]:
If you instead just push through one project and then the next and so.

Brianna Berner [00:22:22]:
On, you would be getting through your.

Brianna Berner [00:22:24]:
Projects a lot faster, meeting your goals a lot faster, and seeing the change in your business and your life. That these goals create a lot faster.

Brianna Berner [00:22:33]:
To add to that every time you shift context.

Brianna Berner [00:22:37]:
Meaning every time you move from one thing to the next, it slows you down, because your brain needs time to become acquainted with that new task. So when you're multitasking, your brain is constantly trying to get up to speed. But context shifting isn't necessarily any better because you're wasting time every single time you shift context, because your brain needs that time to get up to speed in these instances as well. So Gerald Weinberg found in a study that every time you contact switch that you're wasting about 20% of your time. So if you have 2 hours to work on something and you decide that 50% of that time you'll be working on one project, and 50% of the time you'll be working on another project, that you'll actually only get about 30% of that time for the second project because you lose 20% of the time switching gears from the first to the second.

Brianna Berner [00:23:30]:
Now, this isn't to say that you.

Brianna Berner [00:23:32]:
Have to work on the exact same thing for that entire 2 hours, but if you keep working on the different tasks within a project, your brain won't need that time to get reacquainted because you're staying on the same topic. So it's really important to only be engaged with one project at a time.

Brianna Berner [00:23:50]:
If you have client work or other.

Brianna Berner [00:23:53]:
Stuff that you need to work on, spread that stuff out throughout your different time blocks, making sure that you're not forcing yourself to switch contexts within each block, saving you time in the process. But in order for this to work, you need to know how long your various projects are going to take to.

Brianna Berner [00:24:10]:
Complete, because you don't just want to.

Brianna Berner [00:24:12]:
Keep writing the same project down over and over again in your different time blocks. So the first thing that you need to do is make sure that the project is set in a concrete, tangible way, so that you know, without a.

Brianna Berner [00:24:25]:
Doubt, once it's done, then you need.

Brianna Berner [00:24:28]:
To break the project down into all of the different steps you need to take to get it done. And finally, you need to assign due dates for all the steps to make sure that they get done and so that you stay on schedule. When creating your projects, you want to avoid abstract or ambiguous language. You don't just want to say something like I want to create more content, or I want to get more customers and so on. I mean, these are great things to want, and they may line up perfectly with your values, your vision and your aspirations, but they're not clearly defined projects. For a goal or a project to have an impact, you have to be clear on the exact outcome you want and how you'll know when you achieved it. So something like I want to write three new blog posts or I want to get 100 new email subscribers is easier because, you know, without a doubt.

Brianna Berner [00:25:19]:
Once you hit those numbers, plus it's.

Brianna Berner [00:25:22]:
Always easier to create a game plan to hit those specific numbers. The next step then, is to map out the different steps that you need.

Brianna Berner [00:25:29]:
To take to get it done. When you do this, you want to.

Brianna Berner [00:25:33]:
Try to think of all the steps you'll need to take. But none of this is necessarily set in stone. You have to allow for some degree of flexibility as you work through the project. So keep that in mind. But let's go back to the Write Three blog post example. Because it's pretty cut and dry, you would break down the different things you need to do to make that happen keyword research, writing the article, editing it, creating your graphics, and so on. The final thing we need to do then, is to give all of those.

Brianna Berner [00:26:01]:
Steps a due date so you could.

Brianna Berner [00:26:03]:
Schedule in keyword research for the first article into one time, block writing it into another, editing and formatting it into another, and so on. And after you do this, you'll have an action plan in place to complete your first project and to get it done a lot sooner than if you were trying to get a bunch of other stuff done at the same time.

Brianna Berner [00:26:25]:
Okay, so far I've given you the.

Brianna Berner [00:26:28]:
Exact framework you need to set yourself up for success, to get more done during the day, and to start crushing your goals. But the last piece of the puzzle is absolutely essential to that success. So the last step of the Power method is refine and reflect. As you're working through things, you need to allow yourself to be flexible. And to be clear, I don't mean being flexible on the goals or projects themselves. Once you've set a goal, you need to commit to it and see it through. But you do need to allow some flexibility in the steps you'll take to get there.

Brianna Berner [00:27:03]:
Because as you're working through a project.

Brianna Berner [00:27:06]:
You may realize that you need to add in a step that you didn't plan for, or that a step you already have scheduled isn't really necessary. And a lot of times you won't know this until you're in the trenches, or you may realize that you're doing something that just doesn't mesh well with your style and how you normally do things. And that's totally cool because life is a learning process, so it's only natural to figure things out about yourself as you go. And this is why it's so important to schedule in time to check in on everything that you're doing, to reflect on what's working and what isn't working. And you don't need to wait until the end of a project or the end of the month or quarter to do this. Anytime you're working on something, you should schedule in checkpoints throughout it to make sure that you don't need to make.

Brianna Berner [00:27:53]:
Any adjustments.

Brianna Berner [00:27:54]:
Don't just stubbornly demand that what you've.

Brianna Berner [00:27:57]:
Decided has to work.

Brianna Berner [00:27:58]:
Check your stats or do a gut check and see how things are going. And if something just isn't panning out the way you thought it would, make any small adjustments that you need to make to get back on track. And you don't have to just focus on the things that aren't working either. Make sure that you take note of what is working so you can expand on that and get even better results next time. As entrepreneurs, our businesses will always grow and evolve as we do.

Brianna Berner [00:28:26]:
And allowing ourselves to make these small.

Brianna Berner [00:28:29]:
Pivots over time is so important to keeping our business relevant to our ever changing values, visions, and aspirations, but also to keep up with the ever changing demands of our customers and our audience. So embrace growth and let it happen organically from your experiences. Take the time to schedule in these routine checks, and over time, you'll find your own way to really assess the health of your business and how efficient you've been with your time, your energy, and your resources as you start to do this regularly. It's a system that has to be implemented and improved upon over time. And if there's one thing I want you to take away from this training, I want it to be that. It's the systems that you implement in your business and how you allow them to grow with you that will ultimately dictate how often you reach your goals, how efficient you are with your time and how much you actually get done. And that is my Work at home Power method. It's designed to be incredibly simple so that it's easy to implement. But the simplicity of it is why.

Brianna Berner [00:29:37]:
It works so well, because it gives.

Brianna Berner [00:29:39]:
You the structure to plan out your day in a way that makes sense to you, how you function and the different things that you have going on. It gives you the flexibility to make adjustments as you go and not be totally thrown off when the unexpected happens. Because let's be real, the unexpected is going to happen, and it gives you the ability to knock your projects out faster than ever because you have a solid game plan. So now that you have the Work at Home Power method, I hope it helps you restructure your day so that you can start getting more done in less time, building a life that you're wildly passionate about in the process.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:17]:
All right, Brianna, thank you so much for all that useful information. I know it's definitely going to help me in better structuring my days. I'm sure everyone else found that useful as well, so thank you.

Brianna Berner [00:30:28]:
Of course.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:29]:
So, any final words for attendees trying to do better working at home?

Brianna Berner [00:30:36]:
I guess my biggest tip that I.

Brianna Berner [00:30:39]:
Can give is just be intentional and plan ahead. And I know that so many people think that that's just more time they have to dedicate to something. But spending those five minutes checking in with how things are going, how things went and what you need to maybe change in your day to day schedule can really make all the difference. So that is the main thought that I want to leave everyone with today.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:05]:
Okay.
