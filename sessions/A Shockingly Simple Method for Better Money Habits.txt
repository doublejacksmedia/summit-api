[00:00:12.540] - Katherine Pomerantz
Welcome, Blogger Breakthrough Summit 2024. This is a shockingly simple method for better money habits. I'm Katherine Pomerantz. I want to give a special welcome to all of the business owners watching today. Wait, hold on. Did Katherine say business owners? Surely she meant bloggers, right? No, this is the advanced track. This session in particular is for bloggers ready to take themselves seriously. What do I mean? Well, imagine. Your audience is growing consistently, with more readers and more followers every day, followers who are raving fans and want to buy from you. And you are leading and managing an efficient team that you can delegate admin and busy work to, and that are going to help you scale to multi-six and multi-seven figure sales. And your blog doesn't need you to operate every day, so you have plenty of time to take a real vacation. You can take care of your family. You can scale those profit margins. And you're buying homes. You're sending your kids to dream schools, and you're having once-in-a-lifetime experiences with profit from your blog. You're paying yourself a real salary and you're saving for a real retirement. This is not a dream. 

[00:01:30.010] - Katherine
This is not a dream, and it's also not the experience of just like a few lucky individuals, okay? This is what it's like to have a successful business. And so many bloggers are struggling to create this for themselves even though blogging is a proven and really good business model. You have low overhead, you're very adaptable, and you can switch gears really easily, right? Because bloggers don't think like business owners. So, today's session is for you if you are ready to take yourself seriously as a business owner. You're ready to experience all of these incredible results. So, you're already creating or finding products to sell, or you are pitching strategic partners who are going to pay you. You're committed to growing not just your audience, but also those sales. This session is for you if you're willing to invest not just your time, but also your money. And this is for you if you are ready to receive a big return on that investment. I'm Katherine Pomerantz, as I mentioned. I'm an actress turned accountant and I am a money coach for creative business owners. Yeah, you heard that right too. Actress turned accountant and a money coach.

[00:02:46.110] - Katherine
My personal story is really interesting, and I will share more about that in a minute. But first, how many people today want to make more money? Yeah, raise your hand. I mean, I know I can't see you, but I can imagine, raise your hand. And how many people know how to make that happen? Yeah, do you think that working more hours or maybe more productivity is going to help you make more money? Be honest, raise your hand. It's okay. Do you think new ideas or a new strategy is what's going to help you make more money? Do you think more readers or more subscribers or more page views or whatever, right? Do you think more revenue is going to make you more money? This is what most business coaches will tell you. You just need more work, more strategies, more audience, and you're going to end up with more money. But this is a complete lie. I don't say that to be rude, the facts back me up. Most people work a steady job for 40 hours a week. Most people work hard and then eventually they retire. But most people in retirement are still struggling.

[00:03:50.930] - Katherine
In America, where I work, the statistics are pretty bleak. 56% of Americans think it is impossible for them to save enough for them to retire. In Australia, the numbers get worse. They carry more personal debt on average in Australia. So, 82% of people in Australia think it's impossible for them to retire comfortably. And in the EU, where you don't have to save for your own retirement, but you have a pension or a government stipend that will help that you can live off of in your retirement? Well, famously, a lot of countries in the EU, particularly France, in particular England to the UK, they're having a lot of protests and they're having a lot of unrest, and they have for years now because those pension plans are running out of money. Clearly, working hard your whole life does not guarantee money. Most Americans, on average, are going to earn $1.7 million in their lifetime. So, where does all that money go? Why don't they have any left? Okay, so more strategies, right? A new idea. Clearly, that's going to be the secret. It'll help you make more money. Well, how many of us have ever hired a coach, or bought a course, or read a book and followed all the steps, but it still didn't seem to work the way you thought it would?

[00:05:07.130] - Katherine
Yeah, I will raise my hand. I definitely have. I have paid thousands of dollars before and ended up with nothing to show for it. And the sad truth is that behind every business is a new idea and is often a great strategy. But 65% of businesses are still going to fail in less than 10 years. And 82% of the businesses that fail, the reason they give is cash flow. Even when they're profitable, they can still run out of cash. So, where is that money going? Okay, more sales. Surely more revenue will help you keep more money. Well, as I mentioned, I am a small business accountant and a coach. So, I have seen behind the scenes of hundreds of six-figure and even seven-figure businesses. I have seen people who make a lot of money. And I have also seen someone who made that first seven-figure launch with her online course, but did not have enough cash that month to make payroll, and they ended up further in debt to cover the difference. I have listened as someone confessed to me that they run an eight-figure business - eight figures, tens of millions of dollars in revenue - but they have zero dollars in their retirement account, and they're terrified because they don't know how to do anything except keep working despite being in their 60s.

[00:06:24.390] - Katherine
I have supported a new mom who went back to work the day after giving birth because, even though she had four employees, a business manager, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracted client work, her business didn't have the systems to work without her. She couldn't take her maternity leave. And I have helped not one, not two, not three, but over a dozen different clients who had tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt from the year they started their business. They just charged everything to their cards, and they trusted all that money was going to come back to them. But now, three, four, and sometimes five years later, they still hadn't paid any of it off despite making well over six figures a year. They did earn a return on that investment, but they still couldn't get rid of the debt. Clearly, more sales do not automatically equal financial success. Now, okay, I want to pause. Got a little heavy there, right? And it might sound like I'm shaming everybody because I'm telling you all these scary statistics and stories about money, and that is not my intention at all. I am putting this first because I want you to understand, if you take nothing else away from my workshop today, that these common solutions - more hard work, another great strategy, or more readers - these alone are not going to make you money.

[00:07:44.280] - Katherine
I'm sure everyone today is already hardworking, they're already smart and have great ideas, and they already have readers who love them. You would not be on the advanced track of this Blogging Summit if you were not those things, frankly. So, what are the real problems here? Most of the content creators who find me, they're making between $50,000.00 and $200,000.00 a year. They have figured out how to create an audience and how to make sales, and they've made a good job for themselves. But they don't know how to take that blog and turn it into a business. So, they're experiencing ineffective time management, all of the daily tasks of growing their blog, and they're starting to feel overwhelmed. They are working so hard and getting little results. Or maybe you're having difficulty in delegating and building an effective team. Can you afford that VA? Can you afford your next hire? And how do you know if paying for them is going to help your growth or if it's just another expense? You're experiencing feast and famine cycles in your numbers. That's a really common one, inconsistent growth. The audience and the revenue go up and down, up and down.

[00:08:50.860] - Katherine
Algorithms change, consumer preferences change, and you're starting to feel burned out because you're just along for the ride. And you have difficulty in understanding and managing finances. Most often, this looks like struggling to manage expenses, uncertainty about what to invest in marketing and advertising, what strategies are going to work for you, and uncertainty about what products you need to create, and how do I price these products competitively. And so often, the content creators who find me, they've already tried one of the things we've mentioned. They already work hard and they just keep working hard and they just think after this project or after this time period, then everything's going to be set up, it's finally going to be done, and I can just relax as the money just comes in. Or they research or they attend summits like this, and maybe they ask their friends or they hire a coach and they come up with new ideas to try. Or they just focus in, nothing else. I'm just going to focus on growth and revenue. I'm just going to hyper-focus here and everything else is less important and everything else is going to work out if I can just keep getting bigger.

[00:09:54.600] - Katherine
But this doesn't really fix any of these things because all of the things that are actually stressing you out: time management, overwhelm and overwork, team difficulties, inconsistent growth, financial instability. These are all symptoms. They are not the problem. They are symptoms of people who are avoiding their money. Think about it. If the goal is to make more money, then why doesn't the solution involve our money? And it totally does. So, I call this making money your teammate. Yeah, that sounds goofy. But as a business accountant, I can truly diagnose almost any problem in your life or business by looking at your finances. I'll give you a couple of examples. I had a client who ran an online boutique. She was making 30K, and often 40K a month. But I took one look at her balance sheet where owner's pay is listed, and I said, 'You don't value yourself enough.' And this client, I will never forget it, she just froze. It was like, deer in the headlights, like baby deer, I'm in danger, just frozen on this Zoom call. And eventually she just very quietly asked, 'How do you know that?' Because in the four years, she had been running her business.

[00:11:15.030] - Katherine
And despite making $30,000.00 a month, she was paying herself almost nothing. Percentage-wise, it was so tiny. So, I pointed that out. Every dollar she was making was immediately going to somebody else or something else, and she was keeping none of it for herself. And this prompted a really good conversation with this client. She admitted, and it just all came out in a rush like, no, she didn't value herself. This was a lifelong struggle for her, and she's made a lot of progress, but clearly, this was still a strong influence over her actions. And her money told me that. I had another client, a podcaster and a blogger this time. I had a pretty big one, although I won't name names. I took one look at his PNL, his profit and loss report, and I told him, 'You have to get less conflict avoidant.' He just laughed. He's like, 'I mean, I don't disagree with you, but what makes you say that?' Right? He had sponsored posts every month. But he was losing money on every post he put on his blog because he wasn't negotiating a higher rate. He just took whatever the first thing they said was.

[00:12:21.110] - Katherine
And his team had expanded. His blog was doing well. And so he was paying people more to set up these posts than he was making on the posts. And he had no idea because he didn't know how to ask for his money. And so, most of us, we don't really know how money works, right? I'm not shaming those clients. They were doing nothing wrong. They were clearly very successful, but they just didn't know how to engage their money in the right way to get them the information they needed. Because we aren't taught this in school, and it's considered rude to talk about money. We also don't learn very much from our parents or our friends. Even if it is discussed, there's a really good chance that the person talking to you is also not an expert in money, and so the information you're getting isn't very good. I'm going to let you in a little secret today. This is lifted straight from my Unstoppable program. I am giving you this for free. Money can be your teammate in building the life and business you really want. You can assign money jobs just like any other member of your team, and money will never tire and it will never stop working on that job.

[00:13:26.930] - Katherine
It even has the power to create more of itself. Money makes money, right? Have you heard that before? What's more? Money is a really good teammate. Not only does it never get tired, it's a good communicator. It will give you regular updates about its progress and how close it is to achieving the goals you set for it. And money is not afraid, to be honest with you, so you can trust what it's saying. It will tell you when things are stuck or when things are not working very well, and it will tell you where you need to focus your energy to improve. Do you know how to use money like that? I didn't. I didn't. Remember, no one teaches this in school, and not everyone, actually very few people, have rich friends or parents or successful business owner acquaintances who are going to teach you that either. I used to really struggle with money. Money was not my teammate. It was the greatest source of stress and fear in my life. As I mentioned, formerly, I was an actress. It's probably more accurate to say I was a performer because I wasn't really interested in film.

[00:14:31.500] - Katherine
I wanted to be a choreographer and a director. I was a modern dancer, as you can see here. And I like the symbolic and weird artsy things. Much to everyone's surprise, including my own, I was very serious about my career but did decide to get married really young. My husband wanted to go get a PhD. I wanted to support him, so we moved to small town in Oklahoma, which is not the best place to support a full-time career in the arts. Not a lot going on in a small town in Oklahoma, but I tried. I worked three or four jobs to fill in the gaps. I worked 60 to 80 hours a week, and I drove all over the state to go work here, work here, work here, audition there, go do this, and all of that effort. I was so proud when I would bring home $1,500.00 a month. Yeah, $1,500.00 a month. Remember, my husband was a student. I was the primary breadwinner in my family at this point. So, we were stressed about money all the time. I mean, there just wasn't enough of it. I had no idea how I could get more of it.

[00:15:37.210] - Katherine
I was already working four jobs. I could not work harder. I noticed also that all of my friends and my colleagues and my mentors were doing the same things. That statistic I mentioned earlier, 56% of Americans don't feel like they can save enough for retirement. Yeah, that's more than half of all Americans. So, over half of the people you know are also struggling like this. So, I just thought, 'Wait, okay, if I can figure out how money works because clearly, I am missing something. There's something about this system that nobody told me. If I could figure that out, then I could help a lot of people.' So, I just started spending money. I listened to books, I read podcasts, I took courses, and I completely fell in love. Only a year later, I had started my own accounting firm for small business owners. And I was really good at it, really good at it, you guys. My business grew really, really, really rapidly. And a couple of years into my business, I started to notice another trend. I had some clients who were crushing it. Every month, they would take the numbers I gave them, right?

[00:16:44.730] - Katherine
Because I was doing the tax strategies. I was organizing their books, so I could give them a lot of information. They would take that information and they would go just crush their goals. But then I had other clients that had the same organization, the same strategies, and everything just stayed really chaotic with them. Even when things changed externally, internally, they were always still messy about it. I started to get really curious about that. There's something that my chaotic clients need that isn't getting organized. They were organized. I was doing it for them. But there was still something about their experience with money that needed to change. Clearly, there was something about money I still hadn't yet figured out. I started to get curious about that next. And then I was like, 'Hold on, my own experience with money is really weird. How did I go from this blonde woman you see here on the screen, this cute little blonde dancer actress with no experience at all, how did I go from that to running a successful, well-sought-after, well-respected, referred, highly acclaimed business accountant in one year?' I wasn't trained in this. I didn't take an accounting class.

[00:18:00.860] - Katherine
I don't have a business degree. And more than that, internally, since that's my new focus, I enjoyed working with money almost, actually as much, if not more, than I enjoyed being a full-time actress. This job was fun. How is that possible when money used to be the greatest source of fear and stress in my life? Like something weird happened. And then I realized I am so good at this because I'm a storyteller first. I never stopped being a storyteller. These pictures are from my very first brand photoshoot. Do I look like an accountant to you? Yeah, no, I still don't. I still don't look like an accountant. I still don't talk like an accountant much either. I knew I had to get these shots because I wanted to visually represent the transformation my clients were going to have with me. I wanted to tell the story. I am so good at my job because I'm still a storyteller. Money is primarily a language with which we tell stories. And because I was a dancer, because I liked all the weird plays, I had over a decade of experience in telling stories with an abstract and symbolic language like money.

[00:19:11.800] - Katherine
I could intuitively take the goals of my clients, and I could arrange all their financial data to give them more information about that goal. I could tell a story with money. And when I realized that, I realized I could teach that to other people. So, this became the money storyteller method. Its three pillars are the money story, the money systems, and the money map. This is how we can transform ourselves from avoiders into successful business owners who use money as our teammate. This is how we can get to the root of all that inconsistent growth, our poor time management, all that financial insecurity, and we can flip it. It can help us. This method will help us keep more money and take more time away from work. Just like that successful business owner I talked about at the beginning of this presentation. Let's get into this. Is this your problem? Are you an avoider now? What does avoiding your money look like? Here are signs that you are an avoider. You hope or trust that things are going to magically work out. They have before, so do you really have a problem?

[00:20:17.120] - Katherine
I mean, do you really have to put any effort in here? Okay, you might think that you could just make more money, not realizing that you're automatically going to start spending more money, too. That's good. I have no problem with people who spend money. But if you don't have clear boundaries in place to make sure that money is going to your most important things, then you're not going to get wealthier. And so is money actually taking care of you even if you know how to make more of it? Maybe you already have a bookkeeper and accountant, so shouldn't they just tell you everything you need to know? You don't feel ready, so you never set up the systems. You never invest in that tech. Or you're like, 'I'll do that when I get bigger.' And so you end up wasting a lot of time and energy cleaning up messes. Or maybe you have tried a system. Maybe you've read Profit First, a great book. But he suggests you have seven bank accounts. And so maybe you did that. You read this book, you did all those steps, you tried the new system, and it was really complicated and you got frustrated, and so you just stopped working on it.

[00:21:17.300] - Katherine
Or maybe you make every decision based on your bank balance. You just open it up and you hope that your credit card is going to clear, or you hope that you're going to be able to spend this money and it's going to be safe because maybe you don't need it next month. The money is right there now. Hope it's okay to spend. Or maybe you're just you're settling for good enough. Your bills are paid, and you generally enjoy your life. So, why bother? If it's not broken, right? Why fix it? And you don't realize that you're likely leaving money on the table, especially when it comes to taxes and your investment strategy, that financial planning because you're settling and you're not investing in what you need that's going to allow you to grow. And there's other people too like, 'Oh, what you don't know doesn't hurt you.' You don't know that this is costing you real money. You don't even realize that you're avoiding it. You don't ever make it a priority to learn how money works and to improve your ROI of all of the actions and money that you're spending in your business. Let's get really specific.

[00:22:15.050] - Katherine
If you resonated with one or two of those things, and sometimes me too even, I definitely had a lot of those back in the day. Let's get specific. How much is this avoidance costing you? Let's measure it, right? Here are some examples to get you started. What is on your to-do list that you just need to just get done, right? Just get done. Are you looking at your bank or credit card accounts regularly? Are you tracking and planning with your money? Do you need to get organized? Do you need to file? Are there piles everywhere? Do you need to finish your tax prep? Have you filed all your back taxes? Do you owe anybody money? Are you creating a tax savings account? Are you raising your rates? Do you need to finish and finally get that online course out there? Is there something you've been sitting on that you just need to get visible and promote more? Are you enhancing the value of your offer? Do you know a way that you could improve it and charge more? Do you just need to do it? Are you pitching yourself? Are you actually cold emailing people and be like, 'Oh, my God, I'd love you to engage? Oh, my God, I'd love you to pay me. Oh, my God, I'd love you to become a client.' 

[00:23:12.260] - Katherine
Are you putting yourself out there? Are you following up with leads? Are people reaching out to you and then you let them sit for a couple of days before you reply and they get cold? Are you collecting on any invoices that are past due? Are you addressing fees or looking at your expenses, and all your tax subscriptions? Are you focused? Are you doing time blockings that your most important things are getting done? All of these things could be ways that we are avoiding our money. Make your own list. You can come up... These are some general things here, right? Come up with your own specific ones, pause the video if you need to, and then come back. What's next? All right, now let's figure out the cost. Remember, in the client examples I gave, my clients who were not valuing themselves or need to be less conflict avoidance, there was both a dollar cost and a pain and emotional cost. How much are you losing by just not getting this done and letting it worry and distract you?

[00:24:07.390] - Katherine
I have a ton of examples on the screen, but here are some of my favorites to get you started, right? Raise your rates. These are all real client examples that I gave you. Raise your rates. Well, you'll stop resenting your clients and you'll earn an extra thousand dollars a month. That's nice. Finish getting your offer out there,  and start to promote it. You'll stop feeling out of control like you're just so busy. And that extra offer or that new thing might make you $50,000.00 this year if you get it launched. Are you pitching yourself? Well, you'll stop comparing and feeling jealous of other people's successes. You'll start focusing on what you can do, and maybe you'll bring in like $6,000.00 of sponsored revenue or co-speaking fees. Are you following up with your leads? You stop wondering if you're not good enough and you're going to close more sales and you're going to get an extra $10,000.00 this year as a result. All real things I've seen people do. Or maybe you need to collect on some past-due invoices. You'll stop feeling small and ignored and you'll find $3,000.00 just sitting there. You just need people to pay and focus on time-blocking, this is my favorite one.

[00:25:07.520] - Katherine
By not doing this, well, you could end your overwhelm and maybe you'll earn like an extra thousand dollars a month because you are prioritizing better. All real examples. Again, tons of things on the screen. Pause the recording if you need to, figure out your own examples, and estimate what is this costing me emotionally and in dollars. Now, add all these together. Using all of the examples from the previous slide, I showed you the math here on the screen. Per month, it added to $26,820.00 just in the monthly things they were avoiding. Then per year, if I added the months together and then I added all those annual increases that they would have, it was $419,640.00. But don't just stop at one year. Over 10 years - if you don't do this now and you just let it sit over 10 years - that's $4.19 million that this person could be making. So, what's your number? Again, pause if you need to, add everything together. It's not unusual to do this with clients and to come up with one million or two million dollars over 10 years that they're just letting sit there because they're avoiding their money. If your number is only a few hundred thousand, you're likely underestimating your costs here.

[00:26:20.890] - Katherine
But even still, that's a few hundreds of thousands of dollars that you're just not getting. So, if all of this is possible for us, and we know this is possible for us, why are you avoiding your money? Here are the reasons I hear most often, right? 'I don't like money.' We secretly wish we could just get away from having it. Money is icky. It's bad. It's uncouth or it's just downright evil, right? 'I'm not in it for the money. Or I'm bad with money. It's just too much to learn. I feel overwhelmed. I can't face it, okay? Or I'm frustrated. Why can't this just get handled? Why can't anyone just do their job here? I have team members. I have a bookkeeper. That's their problem.' Or, 'I am bad at saying organized. I'm just bad at it.' Or, 'It's too much work and I'm already exhausted by the effort I have spent here. And I am so busy. I don't even know what I'm looking at.' That's another really common one. 'This is confusing. I'm not good with numbers. I would just be wasting my time,' right? Or my favorites, 'Well, everything works out anyway, so I'm good, right? It's all working out eventually.' 

[00:27:32.140] - Katherine
All of these, all of these examples, are the excuses that I hear when people are avoiding their money, and I point this out to them. All of these are tied to a strong emotion, just like my client who didn't value herself or just like my client who didn't like conflict. And when we realized what was driving that avoidance, the things they did were amazing. My one client who didn't like conflict, he didn't only raise his sponsored post rate, he raised all of his rates. He started making 50% more in every area with no additional work and people paid it. And my client, who was making 30 thousand dollars a month but barely paying herself, she did even bigger things. She did this whole list. And then she got really honest about all of the things in her business that she didn't like, but she was tolerating. So, she restructured her team so she could manage a lot less. And she started shipping inventory to her home office because it was cheaper, and she had to spend less time alone in a warehouse that she didn't feel safe in. So, she did everything from home.

[00:28:37.940] - Katherine
She got to spend more time with her daughter as a result, and she was able to raise her salary by a thousand dollars a month in only three months because all of these changes made her so much more profitable. We all have strong emotions, and when these strong emotions will come up, we get thrown into a stress response. That's just naturally how humans work. That's how our bodies work. And so if we're thrown into a stress response, we're either in fight or flight mode. And so, we avoid our money. That is the response of when we're stressed, right? And it becomes this vicious cycle. Money makes us uncomfortable, and then we've got this huge mess come tax time and it's really hard to clean up, which makes us more uncomfortable. So, even though we're like, 'Oh, my God, this is the last time,' we just keep avoiding it and on and on and on and on. So, why does money, in particular, bring up these strong emotions? Remember I said the information we get about money from our parents and our friends and our partners, it's not very good information? Yeah, this can be more dangerous than you first realize, because all of this information will make up our personal money story.

[00:29:46.650] - Katherine
It affects how we think about, how we feel about, and therefore, how we use our money. And most of this is unconscious. It starts happening even when we're kids. When we see our parents fighting about money, even if they're trying to keep it from us behind a closed door, but we know that's what they're doing, we learn that money is a source of conflict. Or when our friend won't share her cool new toy with you, and then later your father is like, 'No, you cannot have that. What am I, made of money?' You learn that money is something other people have and there's not enough for you. When you're promised a gift or a raise at work, but only if you're a good girl or only if your performance improves, then you learn that you deserve money only if you're good, hardworking, or patient. Or maybe when we just ignore that our partner is eating out every day instead of packing a lunch like you do because that's just easier for him, and well, his job - he's got to see clients - and you just don't say anything about it. You're learning to undervalue your needs, and that's going to be how you save money.

[00:30:52.710] - Katherine
And maybe we see a woman in a designer suit and she's at the other table, and she's just snapping at this waiter, and she's being so rude. And you learn, 'Hey, money makes you rude. And I never want to be like that person. I don't want to be like that rich person. They're out of touch,' right? I can name thousands more examples, thousands of more stories that I've heard people say about these are the experiences they've had with money, right? And when we don't slow down and we address these in the moment, your brain just believes them. And the longer you believe them, the more evidence you're going to find that money is evil, that rich people are out of touch, and that the wrong people are going to get rewarded with money. But maybe someday it will be your turn if you're just smart enough, or lucky enough, or pretty enough, or hardworking enough, et cetera. But all of this contradicts that secret I told you earlier. Money isn't evil. Money isn't anything, really. It's something humans made up, right? And as we discussed, waiting around for the right strategy or working harder isn't going to guarantee you more money.

[00:31:56.310] - Katherine
So, why do we believe these things about money? We want to remember that money is our teammate. If we can learn to speak it's language and assign it clear jobs within our business, it will come back, it will work hard for us. We can rewrite our experience with money and start making a lot more when we become aware of the money stories that are informing us in our current and in our past lives. That's the first of the three pillars, right? Get clear on your money stories. What money stories did you learn in the past? What is your current story with money? And how do you want your future money story to be different? What does making money your teammate look like for you? And then we need a system so that our money stays organized. By looking at our numbers regularly, we can talk to money, and we'll gain even more clarity about our current money story because we're not just aware of the emotional cost, but the dollar cost or the emotional result and the dollar result of all of the things that we're generating through our blog and our business. And then we can pull it all together into a money map.

[00:32:58.330] - Katherine
A money map is a collection of financial reports like a spending and a revenue plan, a cash flow forecast, and your monthly PNLs. If you learn to read all of these things, it's how you can assign money jobs and measure its progress and keep both you and your money prioritized and focused on your ideal future. When you have those three pillars, instead of avoiding your money, you're going to have these good money habits instead. You're going to have improved emotional intelligence. You're not going to panic when something unexpected happens. Instead, you're going to have the tools to process strong emotions and show up for the hard work anyway. You're not just going to be just a hopeful dreamer. You're going to have a clear vision to work towards and a clear path to get there, and the information you need to evaluate if that plan is working. This isn't guesswork. You can know, money will tell you. You will pay your taxes easily, and you're not going to stress about it. It's done. You handled it all year long. You're going to ensure ROI a return on your investment when you spend money on your blog.

[00:34:03.660] - Katherine
You will have a clear strategy for growth, and you will feel confident that you're going to be able to achieve it. You will be a good steward with the money that you're making. You're not going to earn more and then accidentally just spend it all, too. You will make sure your money goes to the most important jobs, and you're not just going to be guessing all the time about stuff. You're going to review your money regularly, and you're actually going to enjoy it because money is fun when it can be your teammate. You will have more money in the bank, and you're going to have more money in your retirement account. And you're going to spend less time working because you're going to have complete clarity on what needs to be prioritized to achieve your goals. And you're going to have a clear plan for how to get more work off your plate, get it to your team as you continue to grow. All of this is possible. So, start by getting clear on your money stories and improving your communication with money. In the Summit Bundle, I have included Tackling Money Issues as a Team, a mini course for couples who want to communicate about money with less conflict.

[00:35:11.390] - Katherine
Often, this is something that we have to talk about with our partners if we're married. But even if you're an individual, you can use this course to learn to communicate better, to learn how to get clear on your past money stories, and some of my best mindset tricks to transform money into your teammate. You can upgrade in the Summit and you can get started on that mini-course right now. It's included along with all of the other goodies that people gave you. Or if you're like, 'Katherine, I don't want a mini course. I am ready to take myself seriously as a blogger and as a business owner. I am ready to scale past 5K months to 10K, 20K, and even 30K and beyond. I want all these financial pillars in my business. I am ready.' Doors are now open for my Unstoppable program. It's a hybrid one-on-one and group coaching program, and in just four months, we will finish and you will have all three pillars of the money storyteller method, and the tools to make creative freedom and financial stability in your own business.
