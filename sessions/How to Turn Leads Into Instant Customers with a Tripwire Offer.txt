Hey, everybody, welcome to the master class. Today, we are talking all about how to turn your new leads into instant customers with a Tripwire Offer. If you're not familiar with what a Tripwire Offer is or with who I am, don't worry. I'm going to cover all the basics. But first, I want to say thank you so much for joining me at the Summit presentation. I feel really honored to have been asked to be here to talk about one of my favorite topics of all time, and really honored that you have decided to join me today.

[00:00:41.170] - Eden
So, let's start with this. I want you to imagine this scenario. You get a new subscriber to sign up to your email list. Now, first of all, that's a win in of itself, right? That's amazing when someone signs up to your email list. Now, imagine that instantly, right after they sign up, you offer them a low cost digital product for just nine dollars. That's it. Really low cost, low barrier for entry product, just nine dollars.

[00:01:08.310] - Eden
And they see the offer. They feel like it's absolutely perfect for them. So, they instantly grab their credit card and they go ahead and make a purchase. How amazing would that be? Now, I know nine dollars doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you haven't made any money online yet, this process sounds amazing, doesn't it? And this is what a trip wire is. Of course, there's more to the process. We are going to go in and cover all of the details.

[00:01:35.430] - Eden
But for now, what I want you to know is that Tripwires can truly revolutionize your business without requiring a ton of effort on your part. There are lots of ways to make money from your website, but I'm sure you've heard of lots of them. Not many of them are as easy as making money with a Tripwire. And that's why I'm personally in love with this method and love teaching it to people, because it's a great way to start to monetize your site with really passive income effort.

[00:02:03.390] - Eden
It's really nice to meet you if you're not familiar with me. And my name is Eden Fried. A quick background about me. Back in 2016, I quit my job and I bailed on my plan to go to law school. I started a blog the very next day with the goal of hopefully being able to make money online. I had bailed on law school. I had dodged the bullet a quarter million dollars of debt. But I needed to figure out how I was going to make money and I wasn't happy in my day job. So, I tried a million one things to figure out how to make money online. I tried freelancing affiliate marketing sponsorships, like you name it. I tried it at some point.

[00:02:39.690] - Eden
Eventually I discovered digital products and within a few days of launching my first online course, I made over five hundred dollars, which quickly turned into a thousand dollars, which turned into fifteen hundred dollars. And you know what it really snowballed from there. And here I am now, years later, still in the digital product world, because I guess you could say I drank the Kool-Aid and I never looked back. And these are a few of the things that you can find me doing these days.

[00:03:07.590] - Eden
I am the host of the Rebel Boss podcast, where I interview lots of women who are creating and selling digital products and have really great strategies to help them launch. I'm the host of the founder and host of The Rebel Boss Virtual Summit, which is a virtual Summit focused on digital product launch strategies. That happens two times a year. I'm also the founder of Rebel Boss University, which teaches my 90-day launch format to get your product launched in a 90-day time frame. And Edenfried.Com is kind of the home for everything where you can find my Podcast, you can find free information, blogs, everything, all about digital product launch strategy. So, that's a little bit about who I am and what I do online.

[00:03:50.700] - Eden
Now, I'm going to leave you with this. I think this is a great place to really dive in. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60 to 70%. I want you to really let that sink in for a second, 60 to 70%. That's crazy. That means that your goal should be, how can I turn my leads into customers as fast as possible? If you know that once someone buys something from you once, they're statistically very likely to buy from you again, your goal should be, how can I get these people to buy as fast as humanly possible?

[00:04:23.730] - Eden
How can I get them from A to B, thinking about buying to actually making the sale? And that's why you need to set up a Tripwire or or else you're really risking leaving money on the table. And I'm saying that it sounds maybe  sounds a little bit blunt. It is blunt, but I really mean this. If you do not have Tripwires set up on your website, you are 100% leaving money on the table because tripwires are the tool that will get your customer from thinking about buying to buying within a split second within just a few minutes time. And there's really nothing else out there quite like this that's going to help your customers or your potential customers become actual customers within a few minutes.

[00:05:07.530] - Eden
All right. So, let's start with. Part one, talking about the foundations of Tripwires, here are the core ingredients for a successful Tripwire: First of all, they're going to be low cost. They're usually between 9 to 20 dollars. Now, I have seen trip wires that are more expensive than this. I have tested trip wires myself that are more expensive than this. But I'm going to just be honest with you, if this is the very first time you're messing around with trip wires, just stick to the bread and butter, stick to what works, okay? Nine to twenty dollars is going to be a sweet spot. Honestly, it should be more like 19.19 because 19 is going to sell more than 20 dollar product.

[00:05:45.230] - Eden
Your Tripwire really has to scratch the itch of a pain point. So, products, digital products, if they're going to sell, they need to solve a problem. Okay, products are just really resolutions to problems. So, if they don't solve a pain point, if they don't scratch the itch of a pain point, nobody's going to want to bite. Right. There needs to be a sense of urgency. People buy because they're scared of missing out on a great deal. I think about Black Friday buyers, any kind of Memorial Day sale, things like that. There's a sense of urgency to purchase before you miss out on a really great deal. And that's what makes a Tripwire really successful, because you are going to be including a timer and limited time, low pricing. And the combination of those two things. It really helps people make a purchase decision very quickly. Your product also needs to give people a quick win. It's not just about collecting the money. Right. Making that nine dollars is great. But you want to wow people with your products, you don't want them to get your product and then feel disappointed that they bought it because then they'll never buy from you again. You want to make sure that your product actually is giving them a quick win. Now, I don't mean to say that you have to give everything right, but you need to give them some kind of quick win.

[00:06:59.210] - Eden
So, here's why tripwires really work: the price is right. It's why not pricing or easy. Yes, pricing. It's so low. So it's like, why not? Right. They're looking at this offer. It's low cost. There's a timer. They're scared of missing out on the deal. It's something that they actually need and they're worried they're going to miss out. So, they're like, "Okay, let me just go get my credit card really quickly." I'm not going to lie to you. I purchased Tripwires many times myself, which is what motivated me to actually go ahead and get them set up for my site because it worked on me. And I've I remember laying in bed at night. It was like 11:30 PM. My husband is snoozing away next to me. I'm scrolling away on my phone mindlessly. I see an ad on Facebook- and you don't have to run ads to this, by the way. But this is where it happened to see it- I saw an ad on Facebook, I clicked on it, signed up for a Lead Magnet, immediately saw a Tripwire and I bought it and I literally got out of bed. And it takes a lot to get me out of that. Right. I got out of that and I got my wallet, put my credit card information and I bought a Tripwire at night. And that's when I knew, okay, I need to figure out how to make this happen to.

[00:08:07.190] - Eden
Now, let me just tell you this. You are not about to get rich off of Tripwire is now you. We talked about the low pricing already nine to nineteen dollars that you know, that's great to make that money. But the goal is not to get rich off of it and you will not get rich off of it. Okay, so your goal with the Tripwire isn't to make money, but there are lots of other amazing benefits to making one.

[00:08:28.880] - Eden
So, first of all, it's going to turn your leads into customers fast. Right. Which means they're likely to buy again. If they're 60 to 70 percent likelihood that they're going to buy from you again because they've already bought from you in the past, then if you can turn them into your customers fast you won, if that's all this would do, it would be worth it. But there's more benefits to tripwires. The earnings that you can get from a Tripwire can cover the cost of your expenses.

[00:08:52.370] - Eden
So, think about the tools that you're paying for on a monthly or annually basis. Maybe you're paying for an email service provider or, I don't know, storage on your computer or lots of other kinds of things that you might be paying for. You might be able to break even or even make a little bit of profit on this. You can cover the cost of your ad spend. And that is huge, because when you can cover the cost of your ad spend, you have an opportunity to infinitely scale your business.

[00:09:20.900] - Eden
Now, I'm just going to preface this by saying I'm not going to be talking about ad spend in this particular training. And you also do not need to ever drop a dime on ads if you don't want to. Okay, so I went five years of my business or four and a half years of my business without ever investing in a single Facebook or Instagram ad and totally doing fine financially.

[00:09:41.420] - Eden
It wasn't until I had the right offer for an ad type offer or funnel that I decided to go ahead and dive into Facebook ads and it wasn't with the Tripwire. So don't listen to this training thinking, "Oh my gosh, Eden is going to tell me I need to run Facebook ads", because that's absolutely not the case. This process is something you can do and you can make money with without touching any Facebook ads or Instagram ads or any kind of ads.

[00:10:09.070] - Eden
And another big win is that you are giving your customers a quick win, and that is important because you are now establishing the know, like and trust factors which are absolutely necessary to get your customers excited to buy from you again and again and again.

[00:10:26.620] - Eden
So, part two, how do we actually go about setting up a Tripwire? In order to go through this process? I want you to understand what a funnel actually looks like, and then we'll dive into where Tripwires fit into this.

[00:10:38.110] - Eden
So, your job online is to get as many people, as many qualified people, I should say, over to your website. So, you know, whatever you're doing on social media or wherever else it may be, you are strategically promoting your content so that they land on your website. Then you are hopefully getting people from just viewing your website to actually signing up for your email list with a lead magnet. Once they signed up for your lead magnet, they've gotten whatever free goodies you've given them. They're now on your email list, which means you have that opportunity to develop that know, like and trust factor and really nurture them with quality email content that will hopefully get them primed and ready to buy your more expensive product from you down the line. Now, obviously, there are more people going into the funnel than coming out of the funnel, but the goal is at the end of the funnel to have customers actually making a purchase.

[00:11:32.770] - Eden
So, where does a Tripwire fit into this process? Right here. So, it's an opportunity for you to make money before you would have made money. So, you don't have to wait to the end of the funnel. Now you have another mini funnel setup, so you get people over to your site, same process. You get them on to your email list with a lead magnet. But right here is where you offer them the trip wire you right after they sign up for that ledman will direct them to a trip wire sales page.

[00:12:00.060] - Eden
Now, here's another way of looking at it. For those people who are more linear and a visual learner, again, you're getting people to your site with strategic promotional strategies, SEO social media. You're getting them over to your site, on to your email list with a lead magnet now there on your email list and eventually you can pitch them your core product. Another way of doing it is immediately from the lead magnet you offer them the Tripwire offer and now they're on your email list and you will give them your core product offer pitch later on. Okay.

[00:12:33.460] - Eden
So, works like this, you get targeted traffic to your website. You convert that traffic to your email list with a freebie or lead magnet, whatever you call it, and then instantly send those new leads to a tripwire sales page.

[00:12:47.890] - Eden
So, here are some of the things that you need to make this happen: Now, obviously, you're going to need a tripwire product. You need a timer software. You're going to need a sales pitch. But it doesn't have to be a crazy long sales page like you're probably familiar with. And you need a payment processor, obviously, to collect those dollars.

[00:13:04.840] - Eden
So, the product we talked about this already, but it's worth mentioning, again, the product that you're offering needs to solve the pain point or it at least needs to scratch the itch of the pain point, meaning start to solve the problem.

[00:13:17.560] - Eden
It also needs to make sense in the grand scheme of things. So, it needs to make sense in your funnel. It needs to build on your freebie and it needs to lead to your end product. Okay. So, I'm going to give you an example here. Let's say you are a Facebook ads marketing expert. Your freebie might be a Facebook ads, checklists, use a checklist for all the things that you need to do before you hit publish on your first Facebook ads campaign. The Tripwire might be a mini course on setting up your first Facebook ad campaign and with video to go along with it so that you're not confused. Everybody has all the information that they need.

[00:13:50.980] - Eden
This example I put in here, because this is an example of a Tripwire that I actually did go ahead and purchase. This is the one I purchased like 11:30 at night. So, yeah, you can see here how the Tripwire builds on the freebie. And now you can imagine that at the end of this funnel there's going to be a more expensive product related to running Facebook ads. So, do you see how it makes sense in the grand scheme of things? The Tripwire is not just a random product. It actually builds on the previous step in the funnel.

[00:14:20.560] - Eden
Another example is a freebie. The freebie could be a list of dangerous home cleaning products for babies. So, if you have a little baby at home, you're worried that the cleaning products you're using might be toxic for your new crawler. You would download this freebie and then the Tripwire would be a DIY recipe book with homemade cleaning products, nontoxic baby, safe cleaning products. So, maybe if you're worried about the cleaning products that you're using at home, you might be interested in making your own cleaning products and you might buy this recipe eBook that helps you make your own non-toxic cleaning products. So, it builds on the previous step in the funnel. It makes sense in the grand scheme of things.

[00:14:59.560] - Eden
Both of these tripwires are scratching the edge of a main pain point. This Tripwire is not going to solve all of your problems when it comes. To starting Facebook ads, right. You're still going to have questions, you're not going to have all the answers that you need, but it's starting to scratch the itch, right? You're starting to get the information you need to feel more confident. And this is obviously going to build that. No, like a trust factor in the same thing is true for this example.

[00:15:27.820] - Eden
Okay, so the format of your Tripwire product is really not the most important thing that I wanted to give you some options. Here is your trip wire can be in the form of an eBook. It can be templates, it can be a bundle of resources. It really can be anything. Swipe, copy graphics and mini course. It could be a full course. It could be something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet. Your imagination is the only limiting factor when it comes to deciding what format your Tripwire is going to take.

[00:15:54.490] - Eden
When you're deciding on the format. I encourage you to consider what you like to make. If it's going to take you forever to make a mini course and don't make a mini course. But if you're really great at writing and it's going to take you a day to write an eBook, then go ahead and make an e-book. The other consideration here is what does your target customers prefer? Do they hate eBooks, but love courses? While if that's the case, you might want to create a course. Do they love graphics but hate something else? Well make that a consideration. When you're deciding pricing, it has to be discounted from something higher.

[00:16:26.890] - Eden
Okay. So, we talked about the low cost pricing, $19.19, but there's really no sense of urgency to buy a $9 product when it's always nine dollars. Right. So, it really needs to be $9 discounted from something more expensive, like twenty five or thirty five or forty five, something like that.

[00:16:45.850] - Eden
You want to avoid pricing like 16 or 18 because 18 feels like more than 15. 16 feels like more than 15. Think about it this way. A $19 product is probably going to sell more than a $16 dollar product, even though the $19 product is more expensive because the $16 product sounds like it's more than 15, but the $19 product sounds like it's less than 20. So, think about the psychology behind pricing.

[00:17:14.020] - Eden
Another thing that you can consider is adding in what's called an Order Bump to make more money. Okay, now we talked about this already that the goal with your trip wire isn't necessarily to make money. There's lots of other benefits to get a new customer being the number one benefit. But that being said, you can still, like we said, cover the cost of your expenses, cover the cost of your ad spend if you choose to go that route. Lots of things that you can do with these earnings. So, if you want to squeeze more juice out of the scale and sale, if you want to increase the order value, you can add what's called an Order Bump.

[00:17:49.600] - Eden
Now, you've probably seen Order Bumps before on checkout forms. So somebody's already checking out. You've already decided you're going to purchase. You're putting in your name, your address, your credit card information, and you're literally about to press buy when you see this flashing box that says, "Wait, do you want to add this to your order?" And it's usually just a paragraph, maybe a picture where it says, "Here's what this is, it's only 19 additional dollars. Check this box to add it to your purchase." That's what an order bump is. It's bumping up the value of the order.

[00:18:22.990] - Eden
Okay, make sure to visibly display the massive discount. So, don't assume that people know it's discounted to 9 from 29. Right. Don't assume that people know that. You want to make sure that people see that it's discounted. So, usually I would do it's $9 with a big 29 in red font crossed off with an X through it.

[00:18:44.470] - Eden
So people visualize the massive discount that's included here. Okay, timer software, you absolutely should do everything you can in your power to have a timer on this page that's visible, because this is one of those factors that's going to help people visualize that there is urgency here, that if they don't make a purchase decision now, that the offer is going to go away, and they're not going to be able to find it again. Okay, I recommend finding a timer and setting it between 12 to 20 minutes. Usually I'll do fifteen minutes. But honestly, it depends on how long my sales page is. You want to make sure that your timer gives people enough time to actually go through the content on the sales page, because if you have a crazy long sales page and a ten minute timer, for example, you're just going to be giving people a sour taste in their mouth and they're going to be frustrated. So, you want to make sure that you balance out the timer with the content on the page, but you don't really want to go more than twenty minutes. And I would say 15 is the sweet spot.

[00:19:41.440] - Eden
You also want to make sure that the timer actually does something. It should expire the page to a, "Sorry, this offer expired page." It should make sure that that page with the offer is no longer available. If that timer hit zero and nothing happens and people see that nothing happened, you've now lost the trust of your potential customer, and they're probably not going to believe you again when you offer them something else with the timer in the future. You want to make sure that the timer actually does, in fact, expire the offer some options for you.

[00:20:13.460] - Eden
Deadline Funnel is my personal favorite. I use it for a Tripwires. I use it for my, like, open closed kart launches for products that I launch throughout the year. I use it for my Summit. I use it literally for everything. It is a little bit of investment, not so much. It's like a monthly cost or something. And there is a free trial, but I highly recommend trying it out. It's really robust and also simple to use, which is a powerful thing when you can find a tool that can do a lot and not be complicated to use; that's that's my kind of tool.

[00:20:45.380] - Eden
Another option would be page expiration robot or evergreen countdown timers. These are free or almost free options that you can check out, and explore whether or not they're going to be right for you, and the tools that you are using. But whatever tool you ultimately decide to go with, make sure that you have a timer, make sure the timer is displayed on the page and make sure the timer does, in fact expire the page, so it's no longer available.

[00:21:11.720] - Eden
The sales page is what we would call a Short Form Sales Page. So we're not talking about having a massive long sales page like you would see for a thousand dollar online course. This is a nine or nineteen dollars somewhere in between product. So, people don't need to have a crazy amount of information in order to make a purchase decision. You want to give them the information that they need and really nothing more. Okay, so that's going to include a headline, a sub headline. You're going to get the timer. I include mock up graphics. I want to make sure that I have that price discount visually. Explain on that page. I explain the features and most importantly, the transformation the product's going to provide. I like to include testimonials and definitely, definitely, definitely include a buy now button. And make sure that buy now button, actually does connect to the checkout page. You'd be surprised how many people forget something like this when I review their Tripwire sales pages. So yeah, this is really all you need on your sales page, your payment processor.

[00:22:09.110] - Eden
Again, the buy now button needs to actually be connected to a checkout page. There are lots of options for you to use when you are thinking about how can I collect payment? Teachable is great. Sendowl is great. Whatever you already have probably will work in some capacity. I don't recommend that you use a PayPal button. A PayPal button is very glitchy. It doesn't look that great. And PayPal often times out, which means that you are going to be losing out on sales most definitely if you are exclusively using a PayPal button. So, avoid that temptation. Trust me, I've had people say, "Oh, I'm not going to listen to you, I'm just going to try it." And they try it and they're like, "Why did I do that?" And they say, I should've listened you in the first place. I've tried this before. You guys learn from my mistakes and other people's mistakes. It doesn't work that well, not for a Tripwire, at least.

[00:22:56.570] - Eden
And then finally, the payment success needs to actually trigger immediate delivery of the Tripwire. This is really important because it's frustrating for somebody when they buy a product that and then they don't actually get immediate delivery of that product. So, make sure that when someone buys, they within a few minutes time will receive access to the product that they just purchased.

[00:23:18.380] - Eden
So, I wanted to share some examples of Tripwire sales pages that I used in the very beginning of my journey. And the reason why I shared these pages with you, is because they are definitely not perfect. However, they worked very, very well. I had extremely high conversion rates for all these Tripwire sales pages, which is why I wanted to show them to you, because mine have evolved a lot since then. But these imperfect sales pages have performed really well, and they're also a great learning opportunity for you.

[00:23:47.720] - Eden
So, this was for a Tripwire called the Email Hack for Bloggers. Now, the incentive to purchase this is that it was going to save you hours and hours worth of time with growing your emails. So, that's that was kind of the value incentive of purchasing. So, this is part of the sales page here. I highlight the transformation. So, it's going to save you 40 hours of work time; that's crazy. Here's a buy now button. I show the options for them to make a purchase. They can use Visa, whatever this is MasterCard, I think, PayPal. I included a graphic mock up. You can make something like this really easily. And Canva. A graphic mockups are really amazing to again, visualize for your potential customer what they're going to get when they make a purchase and what it's going to look like for them.

[00:24:39.320] - Eden
And yep. So, here are some testimonials here. Here's another Tripwire again. Here's a great example of how you can visualize or help people visualize the discount. So, it's usually sixty five. You can get it now for just $9 and roll now for just nine. And here's the value incentive here. You can get your-your sales funnel setup together in the next 30 minutes. I included instead of a graphic mock up on this page, I included an entire two and a half minute tour, so people could actually watch the video in two and a half minutes and see what they're going to get.

[00:25:16.850] - Eden
And then this is another Tripwire where my first ever Rababah Summit is actually a trip. This is from two years ago, the Rababah Summit. And people, can they have 15 minutes to decide whether or not they're going to pay $12 to get the 25 recorded trainings.

[00:25:35.210] - Eden
So, yeah, you can see that my Tripwire sales pitches have evolved stylistically over time. But I personally really love this simplistic format here where you can highlight, here's what's included. Here's a graphic mockup. Here's the button. And then, you can also make sure that you are including the timer like it was right here and other features as well. But this is the core of what you need. And typically, I would actually also include a timer like right above the button or maybe right here so people can see the timer with the buy now button, all the features, the mock up, it's kind of all in this little square.

[00:26:12.650] - Eden
Okay, so part three, does it work? And some next steps for you. Now, I know it's really hard to to to be patient with this process. I've had people stress out that their Tripwire isn't working or it's not working the way they expected it to be working. Let me just tell you this right now, up front at the beginning: You can't analyze the success of a tripwire until you've had at least two hundred people sign up for your lead magnet, actually view the offer. Anything less than that, and you just don't have a good sample size. It's like saying, you know, I've had people actually say, "Oh, my gosh, my Tripwire is not working." And I'll ask them, "How many people saw your lead magnet and saw the actual tripwire offer." And they'll say, "Ten. Okay, well, I'm really sorry, but ten is just not a big enough sample size to know whether or not this is going to work in the long run. It's just not enough people." And I totally get that. It might take you a while to get to 200. I get it. And that can be frustrating.

[00:27:10.790] - Eden
You know, I remember when I was building my email list in the very beginning, it felt like it took forever to get that first hundred people and then two hundred people. It does, it does take some time, but you do need to be patient. Marketing is all about data and it's all about making decisions based on the data. It's not about emotions. As much as you might feel like something is a failure or you might feel frustrated because it's not working. The fact of the matter is the numbers will tell you whether or not it's working- not your emotions, your emotions are just that emotion. So, put them to the side. Don't think about them, journal about them if you want to, talk to a therapist about them, if you want to. But it's all going to come down to the numbers.

Okay, so here's the math. What you're going to do is you're going to take the number of Tripwire customers that you have, divided by the number of people who signed up for your freebie or lead magnet. You're going to take that number and multiply it by 100. So, let's say you had 80 people buy out of 300 sign ups. You're going to point two six times one hundred. That's a 26% conversion rate. That's crazy, right? That's crazy high.

[00:28:16.910] - Eden
Now, let me just go back here and say industry standard conversion rate for a Tripwire can traditionally be more or higher than standard conversion rate for something like an online course or something that's more expensive. So keep that in mind. 26% is a number that you could expect, okay, that I can tell you from my personal experience that some of my trip wires have converted over 30%. So, you can expect to have higher numbers. That being said, if you don't have numbers as high as 26%, 30% or even 20% or 15 %, don't panic because standard conversion rate in most industries is going to be between four to seven percent, okay, and four is even high. Some is one to seven percent. But I would say four for a lot of industries. Okay. So, just keep that in mind because trip wires are lower price on the spectrum of products that are sold online, you can and probably should expect a little bit of a higher conversion rate than a more expensive course or other type of products sold online. But if you end up having a 10 percent conversion rate. You don't need to go crying and freaking out that it's not working because that's fine. All right. So, there is a big range here. That being said, there is always room for improvement.

So, what I want you to do is just keep in mind that marketing is based on the data and based on the data. You get to make changes, you get to make informed decisions. You can keep testing. And some of the things that you can do to make those changes are changing the graphics, tweak the copy on the sales page, play around with slightly different pricing. Maybe the $12 you tried didn't work, so you want to try 9. That's totally fine. Try that out for a little while. Maybe the graphics were not great, weren't solid, and you need to switch those up. Maybe the value incentive for the product doesn't appropriately communicate what the value actually is and what the transformation actually is. Okay. So, marketing is all about testing, analyzing, modifying and repeating that process over and over and over again. That might sound overwhelming, but don't let it be overwhelming. This is just part of the process for selling online. And it's fun. You just have to view it as a part of the journey. Often the biggest problem is the marketing message. I've talked to a lot of people. I've had thousands of students work with me on developing their own Tripwire product. And in my experience, when I evaluate whether or not someone's Tripwire is working, to the extent that it should be working or or evaluating why it's not working, I find that their messaging is wrong. Okay, so you have to- we're going back to what we said in the very beginning. You absolutely have to make sure your product solves a problem. Every product out there that you buy solves some kind of problem.

Take a look around at the things around you. Like all of these things that you have surrounding you are products that you will purchase at one point or another. I'm looking right now at my microphone. I purchased this microphone because in my very first online course that I sold, people told me that my audio absolutely sucked. They liked my content, but they thought my audio was terrible. And so what did I do? I went and bought a microphone to solve my audio problem because I wanted to be able to communicate my message clearly and effectively. And I wanted my students to have a really great experience learning from me. So, I bought a microphone to solve that problem. If you have a product that you're selling doesn't solve a problem that actually needs solving or just doesn't solve a problem at all, no one's going to buy it. So, if you don't focus on that, you're going to have a really hard time selling this product no matter what.

[00:32:09.340] - Eden
You also want to make sure that you don't focus too much on the feature. So, let's say your product really does solve a great problem. You might just be focusing on the wrong thing. You might be focusing on the features of each module in your mini course, or the chapters in your eBook. People don't really care about that. They want to know what your product is going to do for them. So focus on the transformation that your product is going to provide.

[00:32:32.650] - Eden
So, for an example, if your customer is worried that her cleaning products aren't safe for her baby at home and you're selling a product that's all about all-natural cleaning product recipes, your sales mechanism here, the thing you want to really focus on and drill down on is the fact that this is a baby safe product that's going to help you make natural cleaning products, that will help you as a parent, feel guilt free. Don't stress about your baby inhaling toxic cleaning products, because you're going to know exactly what's in your products and you're going to know that it's safe for your baby to crawl around. And even if they do, ingest a little bit of it, it's totally safe. You don't have to have that mom guilt. You can just rest easy. And that's huge. You want to focus on that? Okay.

[00:33:17.590] - Eden
All right. So let's review a little bit here. We talked about a lot. But again, the big idea here is that you want to make sure that in your funnel you are offering this tripwire at the right time. So, again, your goal is to drive qualified traffic over to your site. Once they're on your site, get them on your email list with the lead magnet and bam, right there at that dollar sign. And that's where you're going to be offering your tripwire offer to people. And usually this is instead of like a thank you page or whatever. So, right after they sign up for your lead magnet, they're going to see your tripwire sales page. Whether or not they buy it, they're still on your email list. And you have that opportunity to build a relationship with them, and nurture them with all kinds of quality content. And then eventually pitch and launch them a higher priced offer down the line. That's how it works.
