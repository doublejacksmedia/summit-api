Hi, there. Welcome to my presentation Instagram Without Overwhelm. So my name is Cat Griffin, and I'll keep the introduction short because we want to dive right in. But I am a social media strategist and a multi-passionate entrepreneur which basically means I love to talk about Instagram, but I also love to talk about audience growth, how to maximize profits from your business, how to run a business in a way that feels aligned with you, and all kinds of different things. By day, I'm actually a teacher. I work at a university in South Korea, so I basically live in a cage around a film set. It's really beautiful but quite boring at times, and I live here with my husband and my very crazy dog. All right, let's dive into the presentation because that's what we're here for, so what I'm going to cover in today's presentation is the different areas of Instagram and how they function. We're going to look at what pin posts and evergreen feeds are. I'm going to debunk some common Instagram myths for you. I'm also going to tell you why you want to reuse or repurpose your content on Instagram. So, we've a lot to cover, so let's get going.

[00:01:28.400] - Cat
So, the main areas of Instagram that you're going to be looking at is your bio, your feed posts, carousel posts, stories, reels, and highlights. And they all serve different purposes in terms of how they attract people to your account, in terms of how they can nurture people on your account, and in terms of how you can use them to grow your audience and how you can use them to sell to your audience. So starting off with your bio, so your bio is a little bit of text that describes who you are, what you do, and has a link in there. Now with your bio, by the time someone's landed on your bio, they've already seen some content of yours or they've already seen your handle somewhere else. So, they've generally already got some interest in you and finding out about more about you. So maybe they've seen a post and that's piqued their interest, so they're going to go and find out more about what you do, or maybe you've dropped your handle somewhere for people to look at what you do. Maybe they've been nosying around on your website and click through that way. So, by the time someone's gotten your bio, they've got the idea of maybe -- got a good idea -- a little bit of an idea but some idea of who you are.

[00:02:53.230] - Cat
So your bio now needs to do the really heavy lifting and persuade them that actually you are definitely somebody that they want to know more about. They're somebody they want to follow. So less is more. Remember, Instagram is primarily about the feed, about the reels, about the stories. It's not a sit down and read sort of platform. So, if you've got a long, complicated bio, you could lose people's attention. Keep it short, snappy, let people know who you are. Have a clear call to action. So, you're going to have a link on your bio. It could be your website page. It could be a freebie. It could be a current offer that you've got. You can actually have two or more links now added to the Instagram bio. That's a recent update. But make sure you've got a call to action. Why should somebody click on this link? With any kind of links that you're adding into social media, people need a really good reason to click that link and go and have a nosy because in this case and on Instagram because they want to be on Instagram. They're not on Instagram to go and find websites to search.

[00:04:05.690] - Cat
So, if you want them to go and click through to your homepage, you need a strong call to action of what they're going to get if they do click on that link to go through. An important part to remember is while Instagram is overall becoming more searchable, they're still quite limited in terms of finding people from searchability. Now, on Instagram, you've got your handle which is your @name, and people can find you by typing in the @name or a good portion of that @name. But you also have a second name on there which is, is just called your name -- the bold section, and that's the part which is just underneath your photo on Instagram, and it's where most people simply put their name. Now, it's a great idea to have your name because it does make the account much more personable -- more friendly. But this section is the only part of your bio which is searchable. So if you are, for example, a copywriter and you have copywriter in the main body of your bio people won't find you from that search term. But, if you put your name and copywriter in this bold section, then anybody searching copywriter could find your account.

[00:05:28.780] - Cat
And the more niche you are or the more specific you can be in these terms, for example, if you serve a local audience, maybe you are a baker in Manchester, if you have Manchester baker in this bold section, anybody searching for bakers in Manchester are going to find you, and there's probably not going to be much competition there. When I started my first Instagram account, I was -- it was a travel account, and I had female travel blogger in my name section. Now, if you think how many thousands, tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of people who have set up travel blogs there's, yeah, there's a lot out there, but my name came up within, depending on when it was searched, within the first 10 to 30 people if you search female travel blogger. And within the first 100 people, if just blogger, sorry, just travel blogger, so I was very easy to find. And at that time being, I was getting brand deals and all kinds of things from people because I was so easy to find by those search terms. They didn't need to go and read around and look for me. So, do make sure you use that bold section. Have key terms that your audience could be searching for on Instagram to find you and what you do.

[00:06:55.720] - Cat
And it sounds daft, and I'm definitely guilty of this last one, but keep your links updated. So people are going to click around on there. They might not necessarily click through to the actual final page, but if they do, those links should be relevant, not an offer you had out three months ago. So make sure you're keeping those updated. And if it is going to a Linktree kind of page, think carefully about which link is at the top of that Linktree because that's the one that people are going to click through to so that wants to be the most powerful one. So, if you're directing people to a lead magnet, that should be the top link. If you're directing people to book a call with you, that should be the top link. We've also got feed posts. So feed posts are the traditional feature of Instagram. They are your static images on Instagram. They started off as just being sharing an image. Now, we're sharing an image and a caption, and the trends come and go as to whether we want long-form captions or short-form captions. But regardless, the captions do need to be valuable. They need to be entertaining.

[00:08:12.440] - Cat
They need to be engaging, not just having a great day to day. The captions need to do as much heavy work, heavy lifting as the image does. Now, there's a lot of talk that we should be creating reels and feed posts are dead. There was even rumors at one point Instagram were going to stop including static images in Instagram which was very quickly dismissed by the Mosseri, who himself regularly shares images of -- images on his Instagram feed. Adam Mosseri is the head of Instagram. So if he's doing it, then, you know, they're not going anywhere. And the truth is a lot of people still love feed posts. Some people love reels. Some people love stories. Some people love feed posts. Some people love a combination of all of the above. But as long as people are liking your content and engaging with your feed posts the algorithm will show them your feed posts. So despite anything that you might have heard about them getting suppressed in the algorithm, not getting pushed as much as reels the algorithm did do that when reels first came out, but now the algorithm is showing people the kind of content they want to see. Because if they're not seeing what they want to see, they're not going to be on Instagram.

[00:09:34.420] - Cat
Instagram is not going to make money from advertising. So, providing your audience like what you are sharing, they're consuming what you're sharing, ideally engaging with what you're sharing, then they're going to keep seeing more of what you share and feed posts are still a big part of this. Now, carousels are the extension of feed posts, and carousels are where you can have multiple images but kind of as one post and these are where people swipe through. Carousels are really good for delivering value and for showing expertise. They're also good for engagement because people like to swipe through. They like to find out what's going to happen at the end of the story or the final slide of the carousel. Typically, carousel posts don't get as much reach as a feed post. But what they do do is give you a second bite of the cherry to people who are regularly consuming your content, and carousel posts are often shown to people twice. They'll get to see your first post and then maybe a few hours or even the next day, a few days later, they will get to see your second -- the second image in that post. So, they do act as a re-reminder to people that they've seen your content, that they've engaged with it, that they like you.

[00:11:04.460] - Cat
So, they are a really valuable content piece to use. Stories are a huge part of Instagram, and some people even just hang out entirely in stories either just creating stories themselves or only consuming stories. So, they're great to get into the habit of using, or you can do static images. You can do videos. You can just even do text stories. Things that work really well though are behind the scenes content videos showing what you're doing, and even showing glimpses into you outside of the business version of you. Stories are where you can be much more personable. You don't need to keep everything business-like which I'm putting in, you know, that [inaudible 00:11:58] there, but stories are where you get to be real and you get to show up. And you can show up every day multiple times a day really giving people the chance to get to know you. And you can share a mixture of tutorials, a mixture of value and also a mixture of personality-packed content. And stories really help keep you front of mind. If people are seeing you several times a day, they're going to remember you and they're going to see you much more in stories than they're likely to see you in the feed.

[00:12:35.310] - Cat
Now, stories don't reach new audiences. The only time a story will reach a new audience is if somebody shares that story or if somebody's already landed on your account and they're having a nosy around. So they might not be a follower, but they've got to your account from some means and they're already clicking through on your account, but they won't organically be shared to new people. So they are all about nurturing, building relationships with your current audience. Now, stories come with all kinds of amazing stickers that you can use that can be fantastic as a business owner. So you've got the obvious which is you can put a link right in stories. Now, like I talked about with the bio, if you are putting links in stories, people are often reluctant to click on those links because they want to stay on Instagram. They want to keep clicking through stories. So, do use the links sparingly, and when you are using them have really strong call to action. If you are wanting people to go to a link a more I'm going to say effective but a higher conversion rate of doing this is often to use another form of sticker.

[00:13:56.930] - Cat
So you could, for example, have the call to action who would like my free guide to choosing colors that match your mood. I don't know where that came from, but anyway, that's our free guide. So I'm going to put a poll sticker up and I could have two options like, heck yes, and I would love that. So we've got two positive options. Don't do a negative. We don't need negatives. We've got two positive options. Anyone who clicks on that poll sticker, you can then send them a DM with a link to that free guide. They've given you permission to do this because they've said that they want your free guide. So, this is a way that you can get this link to them without having -- without them having to click away from the stories that they're enjoying. But it also has another really valuable purpose. You send them a DM with the link and you can also say, hey, let me know if you've got any questions. It creates the opportunity for you to start a conversation with that person. They can ask you questions. You can offer an additional tip when you share the link. You can make a comment about something you've seen on their feed. You can start to become a real person who's interacting with them in their inbox.

[00:15:21.930] - Cat
This is a fantastic opportunity. Firstly, the algorithm loves it. If somebody has had a conversation with you in the DMs, Instagram thinks that this person absolutely loves your content. They love you. They're your biggest fan. They want to talk to you which means your future content is going to get pushed to this person. And because this person knows you, you have had a bit of a chat in the DMs they're going to remember you. They're going to take a note of this content that's shared, and they're maybe going to engage or consume it and that the snowball grows. They're more likely then to see future content, and this is how you can really start to build relationships and community. You can also use these story stickers for all kinds of market research. You can use polls asking your audience what they want to see from you. You can use quizzes to assess your audience's current knowledge on something or where they're currently at, and you can use quizzes to build them up to something. So, for example, I could have a quiz saying, you know, our story is good for reaching new audiences. And if people are answering yes, and then they, oh, well then 

[00:16:40.990] - Cat
you need my guide on Instagram where I will teach you how to reach new audiences. So, you can use quizzes to direct people to where you want them to be. There's all kinds of ask me questions stickers. You can ask people just simply to pop in an emoji via a sticker. These again can be ways that you get permission to get into people's DMs and engage with them. I'm going to talk about Reels. Reels are the, the hot thing on Instagram, and they've been around now since 2020 -- 2020 and they are still going strong, but not as strong as they once were, and the reason is some people absolutely love reels. Some people don't want to consume reels at all, and Instagram have had to account for this fact. Reels can be great for getting reach. You'll hear about reels exploding and going viral, but they're not as good as they first were. They're not getting the initial push out when a new feature comes. They've lost that initial one. So you can still get great reach with reels, but you're not going to get great reach just because you're sharing a reel. It has to -- I mean part of it is luck. But it has to be really something that will resonate with your audience.

[00:18:14.050] - Cat
It has to be posted at a good time when your audience are active. And you -- you can can use things like trending music, trending filters. They can help reach a little bit, but again, these are not the -- like when reels first came out within the first of six months, if you used a trending audio, you were guaranteed great reach. Now a trending audio and a bit of luc k will get you great reach. But the trending audio itself isn't the be all and end all to getting you that great reach. But where reels are fantastic is they're great for delivering bite-size value pieces. You can quickly share knowledge in a very consumable way. They're brilliant for showing your personality. But people behave differently towards reels. People are much less likely to click away from reels to go and check out your profile. So while you might get lots of viewers of a reel, you might even get lots of followers from a reel people have followed from within rather than actually going to check out your bio and really getting to know you as a typical rule. The way the algorithm and the way that reels are delivered on the app is to keep people in the reels tab for as long as possible.

[00:19:45.150] - Cat
They want to just keep going to the next video, the next video, the next video. So, they can be a great way for getting reached. They can be a great way for getting followers. They're on their own. They're not a great way for, for example, if you're doing a sale and you've got thousands and thousands of views on a reel, that's not likely to convert to a great number of sales on its own unless a large portion of those people already know you. So, if it's new people landing on a reel, they're unlikely to convert from that reel because they're, they're clicking through to the next reel. Reels as well can be more challenging to reach a target audience. Now, this is getting better as the algorithm has developed. But especially at the beginning, people were making a reel they were getting hundreds of thousands of views, thousands of new followers, and then their engagement overall was tanking because the new followers were not their ideal clients. And the reel had been shown to people who weren't their ideal audience based on the music that was used, based on these filters that are being used, based on the transitions, all these kinds of things.

[00:21:06.950] - Cat
That's less of a problem now. But it is harder to actually reach a target audience with reels, partly because of the mindset when you're creating reels. There is this mindset that we need to make them super entertaining and super on current trends. And actually, what we really need to focus on is, does this reel have content which is relevant, educational, is going to speak directly to my target audience. And yes, I might reach less people in that situation, but the people I do reach are the people who are going to be interested in my content overall and they are going to stick around. Your highlights, so this is when you can save a story. So you've created a story that only lasts for 24 hours. You've saved it to highlights, and they're a really, really, really valuable asset to your IG feed. But they're often forgotten about or overlooked by people when they're creating things. But in terms of consumers, in terms of people landing on your feed, they're actually where they'll stop and look before they -- so that's where they'll first dive into quite often. So you've got your feed. You've got at the top you've got your bio and underneath there is where your highlights.

[00:22:35.050] - Cat
So someone's landed on your page, they've read your bio, and they're going to start clicking through those highlights to get a feel about you and what you do. So, if you don't have highlights there, they can't do this. If your highlights are a year old, two years old, they look really outdated that doesn't really reflect well. And if your highlights are just not relevant, that's not going to help you either. So a lot of people sort of got in the habit quite early creating their Instagram accounts and they'd save things to highlights and, you know, you can have different highlights under different topics, but they wouldn't really have done this very strategically and then they've just been left there. So their highlights that are old. The highlights aren't really that relevant. The highlights that don't really serve a purpose. When in fact, if you're really strategic about these highlights, I say that they can operate as a, I'm British, so I'm going to say a flyer, I think pamphlet, like mini booklet about you, your business, what you do. Now, less is definitely more. People have got short attention spans. If you've put tens upon tens or even tens of highlights up there, people are going to get bored.

[00:23:51.430] - Cat
So, you want to be very strategic about what you choose and choose the best things that will showcase you. Now, I always recommend maybe having three different highlight topics and between three and six highlights within each one. Any more than that and you're getting into the people exiting out, getting bored, sort of territory. And the three topics I recommend for highlights are, first of all, have one which is about you. So, this is where people get to know you a little bit. It doesn't have to be personal. It could be behind the scenes content. It could be you sharing things about your business, but things that actually show you, show your personality. I also recommend that you have a highlight which is your best offerings, so to speak, your showcase offers and keep this short and concise. And then also a highlight of feedback, testimonials, reviews that you've got from people that is social proof. And social proof in your highlights here will do a lot of heavy lifting. It really helps such -- we'll talk about the like and old trust factor, but that takes a while to build up. But social proof helps nudge people in the direction of trusting you because if they're seeing other people trust you, then well, you know, they've got every reason to trust you too.

[00:25:29.510] - Cat
And try and make sure these highlights are very focused. So, if you want to share a specific offer, the highlights are very focused on the offer and you've not just thrown everything at it. And try and make sure that they're personality driven. Make sure that by watching your highlights people can get a good idea about who you are, and what your style is, what the kind of content you create will be. All right, so now I want to just go through a few myths and debug them for you. So we hear a lot about it's the algorithm. The algorithm is not working for me. The algorithm hates me. The algorithm's changed. Firstly, the algorithm doesn't have any major changes that often. The algorithm does shift and makes changes, but this is in response to people's behavior rather than it being sort of effectively reprogrammed. The algorithm is responsive. And the algorithm isn't working against you. Instagram doesn't want the algorithm to work against you. Instagram wants people to be happy on the platform. Which is why, if you start trying to fight the algorithm and you start trying to chase getting followers and getting likes and doing the things you think just to keep the algorithm happy, that's when it does start to work against you because it starts to get confused.

[00:27:02.680] - Cat
If you focus on creating content, which is what your target audience wants to see, it's valuable content, it's engaging content for your target audience Instagram will show your content to your target audience. It will show content to people it thinks will like your content, and you will organically grow. If you start trying to force that, you start to get confused which is why I'm going to jump number four, why follow-for-follow threads are not a great way to grow. So when you share a piece of content on Instagram, Instagram will share that content based on a few factors. It will share it to around 10 percent of your audience initially, and the audience it shares it with are people who are active, recently active on the platform, but people who have engaged with your content recently and your new followers. Because if someone just followed you, Instagram thinks that, hey, they must love your content, right? They've just found your account. They've just followed you. They must love your content. So they will get high priority. So if you've done a follow-for-follow thread and then you've done a thread maybe of liking people's comments, any kind of fake engagement thread like that

[00:28:34.080] - Cat
Instagram is going to think that these people are your target audience. They're going to think that these people love your content because they've just followed you. They've just engaged with you. But the reality is a lot of them won't be your target audience. Even if you're in a group of people that are maybe similar business people to you, are they your target audience, really? And the answer most of them won't be. And even if you do find a group of people that are 100% your target audience, you're not going to be the person for all of them. So, what you're going to do is you're going to have people follow you, people engage with you, for the follow back, for the like back. Instagram is then going to show these people your content the next time you share something. And because you're now no longer in the follow-for-follow thread, you're no, no longer in this fake engagement scenario, these people aren't going to engage with you because there's no reason for them to. You know, they're not following you for your content. They're not obliged to in any way. They're just not going to engage back with you.

[00:29:43.770] - Cat
This tells Instagram that your content is low quality because these people that loved you a couple of days ago now don't want to engage with your content. What else should they think? So, it won't show your content any further and the reach of that post will be reduced and this kind of becomes a reverse snowball effect. So as more and more people are not engaging with you because it will become more and more these recent followers that get showing your content, your organic followers, people who do love what you do, people who do want to see your content won't be shown your content. And, okay, off my soapbox with that one. So the next one is you don't need to keep up with reel trends. I talked about this a little bit before. You -- the way that reels work now is trends are not the be all and end all. It's much more important to focus on creating content, firstly, that you enjoy creating and which will resonate -- which will deliver value to your target audience. And shocker, you don't even need to create reels at all. If you absolutely hate creating reels and this is stopping you using the platform because you feel you should be creating reels or nothing, then just don't create reels.

[00:31:10.090] - Cat
There's still feed posts. They're still doing great. You can still use stories. You can create carousels. You do not have to use reels if you don't want to. And then the final one is that you need to have a beautiful feed. Okay. A beautiful feed might be a tiny nudge in getting someone to follow you. But if you think about when someone lands on your feed, they've either got to your feed because they have seen content you've already shared and they're interested, so they've gone to find out more. Or they've been on your website and they've clicked the link through to your Instagram to find out more. Or somebody's recommended you as a great person to follow, so they've gone to find out more. By the time they're actually on your feed, they're already interested in you. So yes, a beautiful feed might make them stop and think wow this is a really nice feed. This looks great. But in all honesty, they're really looking at what the content is and is that content interesting and relevant to them. So if you are naturally creative, you're naturally artistic, you naturally are brilliant at putting together cohesive feeds, fantastic.

[00:32:32.420] - Cat
Do that. But if you have no idea about how to create color schemes and matching posts and all that, don't worry about it. You don't need to do it. Okay. Final couple of things and pinned posts -- so a couple of years ago, Instagram added the possibility of pinning posts at the top of your feed, and you can pin three posts. These can be brilliant in two main situations. If you are running a specific sale or promotion, you can use these top three posts to promote that. And day to day, you can use these top three posts a little bit like how we talked with highlights to showcase the best of your business. So again, you could have one which talks about you -- what you do. You could have one which showcases your best services. One which showcases your testimonials. Or they could be three really, really great value pieces of content with really strong call to actions. But you want three really strong pieces of content up here which are going to either direct people to where you want them to go outside Instagram, if that's your goal. Or they're going to be really good incentives for people to follow you because, hey, this content looks amazing.

[00:34:08.880] - Cat
And evergreen feeds -- so we're starting to hear quite a bit about evergreen feeds, and there's two main functions of when you would use an Evergreen feed. Number one is if you only want to create reels, but you want to have a beautiful feed when people come and have a look at your feed. Now, I don't recommend an evergreen feed in that situation because I don't think it's representative who you are. So, if you're creating content that's reels and people land on your feed and just see this very curated sort of static feed that doesn't give them an indication of what content they're going to get from you. Personally, I feel it's much better to not worry about having that beautiful feed and having those reels up there so people can see the content you create, the content you share, get to see who you are, and decide if you are right from them -- for them based on what you actually do, what you actually share. And if you really want to make it a beautiful feed, you can actually put covers onto your reels. So it's not like you can't still have a curated feed when making reels. So, my personal advice is don't use an evergreen feed in that situation.

[00:35:24.600] - Cat
But perhaps you want to take a break from Instagram, or perhaps you just never want to use Instagram at all. Despite everything I've talked to you about today, you're like, nope, I don't use Instagram. An evergreen feed is essentially for a nine or a 12 grid, and quite often they're sort of a cohesive image or a puzzle feed. They look beautiful, and you post this once and you never post again. So you would use this to really showcase who you are, what your offers are. And you would do this in the instance that you don't want to be active on the platform, but you know your audience are going to go and look for you on the platform. These days so many people when trying to suss out a business or a person, they go to Instagram to find out -- find out more about them. So, if they can't find anything, you're taking away the opportunity for someone to get to know you better. So, if you have an evergreen feed, this serves as a place where people can get to know more about you, if they've gone looking for you. It doesn't allow you to grow. It doesn't attract new audiences.

[00:36:40.500] - Cat
It's a very, very, very tiny growth, if any, you will get from an evergreen feed. It's literally there for people who go and actively look for you. Now, most people when they teach the evergreen feed, they will only talk about the content that you need in the actual grid. When I teach evergreen feeds, I teach it's also just as important that you have those highlights on perfection and your bio on perfection. This is your one chance after all for people to be seeing the content you've shared. Make sure you've got the whole experience of the blending on your feed doing all the work for you, really letting them get a good feel for you and who you are. And final quick point is I do want to say it's okay to repurpose your content. So, if you don't want to be constantly churning out new content, then you can repurpose content. And it does help people if you repurpose content. If you think people need to see something multiple times in order to really get a good idea, you know, in order to take action, then repurposing your content gives you the opportunity to reshare advice, reshare your message with your audience.

[00:38:04.400] - Cat
So, you're actually helping them to take action on the advice that you're sharing. If you are reusing content or repurposing content, you can use your insights on Instagram as a way to see what content your audience want to see again or want to see more of. You can also take advantage of things like anniversaries -- I shared this a year ago, it's still amazing today -- or a throwback post similarly and you can use it to add a fresh look to something. Or if there's current events, you can go back to an old post and give it an update of I shared this last year. This has changed, but the rest is still great. Or you can just simply reshare something and say, hey, this is so valuable. You need to know this. If you missed it last time, I'm sharing it again, so that you don't miss it. And don't be scared to do this because do you remember what you posted six months ago? Probably not. And I can almost guarantee your audience won't remember what you posted six months ago. So resharing, repurposing that content is not going to look bad at all. Okay. Well, that's me done.
