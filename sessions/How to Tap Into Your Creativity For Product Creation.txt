Hello and welcome. I'm Gabby Conde from acupofzen.com. Welcome to how to tap into your creativity for product creation. In this class, you'll will get inspired to create successful products and come up with ideas that your audience and your customers will love. So the question is, why use your creativity?

[00:00:38.330] - Gabby
Why not do what everyone else is doing out there? Well, I was going to post about what everyone else is doing out there in this class. But I went to go and see this movie with one of my daughters. It's called Shangchi. It's by Marvel, and it's the legend of the Ten Rings. And honestly, I didn't really want to go to see this movie.

[00:01:02.210] - Gabby
I was busy and had other things to do, but it meant a lot to my daughter. So, I went, and every time that I go to see a movie, I get inspired because I'm taking a break from the ordinary routine. And I'm doing something that is different. And so, I allow for ideas to come in. And as I was watching Shangchi, the idea for this talk today was to tap into your creativity to find what it is that is inside of you that is unique and needs to be shared with other people in your products. Because that is what's going to set you apart from your competition.

[00:01:48.530] - Gabby
And it's also going to really make you feel great about what you do in business. So, of course, Marvel was created by Stan Lee, who wrote Spiderman, who came up with Spiderman. I'm sure you've heard of Stan Lee. He has created so many characters. And one of the things that I've noticed about the movie industry is that they seem to run out of ideas.

[00:02:17.630] - Gabby
But if people tapped into their creativity and their imagination like Stan Lee did, they would have the most amazing films, just like the Marvel films. All of them are amazing and great. Of course, they have great writers that help to write the films and make them funny and relevant to modern times. It all started with Stan Lee when he decided to create his own comics and came up with all of these characters just out of his imagination. Stan Lee was also really practical.

[00:02:51.890] - Gabby
He would show up at a lot of comic conventions and be there. And I knew someone who got his drawing, I think he drew a Stan Lee signed by Stan Lee, and Stan Lee thought it was funny. And I think Stan Lee had this huge head dispenser, which was a likeness of him that used to sit on his table when he would go to conventions. So, I've heard this second hand.

[00:03:18.530] - Gabby
I didn't actually experience it. But Stan Lee is just an amazing creator who tapped into a lot of his ideas through his imagination. So, let his legacy inspire you to also tap into your ideas. And, of course, you may not be a comic book creator or a movie creator, but this is just an idea of what you can create through your imagination. Then there's Coca Cola.

[00:03:50.570] - Gabby
Coca Cola wouldn't have gotten started if it wasn't for experiments that they did to create the original Coca Cola. And they didn't just stop there. They didn't just make one product. They have, like, I think here in Atlanta at the Coca Cola Company, they have these taste tests. They have, like, over 100 different flavors, and some of them are not on the market. And some of them, I've heard, are really, really gross.

[00:04:19.130] - Gabby
But they kept creating. Their product development came up with so many different flavors to try out and see how they would do in the mainstream market. And the same may go for you. There may be some courses or some products that you create that flop. And there may be some products that create that build a legacy, like the original Coca Cola. You can see that they've added on several popular flavors since then, like Sprite and Doctor Pepper.

[00:04:47.810] - Gabby
They even have this core power and vitamin water. It looks like they must own Dunkin Donuts Coffee now, because that's here, too, as well as Fanta Gold Peak Tea, Smartwater, Minute made, Powerade. They also acquired other people's different brands, but they've come up with several different flavors all on their own. So, even if orange-flavored Coke may not go that great with people, there's always a vanilla Coke that does. So, even if you come up with a product that doesn't fly that well, there might still be a segment of the market who needs it and who wants it. And there might still be lasting product that you have that appeals to many more people.

[00:05:37.670] - Gabby
So, don't hold back on your ideas. Just go with the flow and see what comes up for you during this presentation. Another popular website. So, we don't just have to talk about products, but we can also talk about websites. Mashable founder Pete Cashmora.

[00:05:54.770] - Gabby
He created a news aggregation type of site, Mashable, that took a whole bunch of different topics and put them all together. But they're still transforming Mashable. They're still innovating in their industry. Slutty vegan, this is a restaurant that's here in Atlanta, and I believe it's actually nationwide now.

[00:06:16.250] - Gabby
I'm not sure maybe it expanded into some other places. They have really grown in popularity. And they've expanded their restaurant chain. And it all started from Aisha Cole here, who decided to create her own restaurant based on a vegan menu. And to be honest, it's not really popular around here.

[00:06:40.310] - Gabby
There's, like, Longhorn Steakhouse, and people go and get their steaks. Or there's Chilies and several other restaurant chains, restaurants are very competitive. But she decided to do it, and she did, and she's been really successful with it. So, believe in your ideas, no matter what they are, even if they come in fleeting and you know that there's some kind of thing there for you. Go for it.

[00:07:06.830] - Gabby
Oh, I should have included this. But one of my favorite guitars, Steve Vai. He had an idea for a song when he was learning guitar from Joe Satriani, and when he does a lot of instrumental work, not necessarily anything with words that much. So, his guitar is mostly instrumental. And so, he had this quick couple of notes that came in that he wrote down, and then he stored it away for quite a while.

[00:07:47.270] - Gabby
And now he used to tour with Frank Zappa, and he used to be with David Lee Rossban when David Lee Ross put up from Van Halen, and then eventually he decided to go solo. And so, when Steve Vai took out this old couple of notes that he had for the song, he expanded it into the most amazing song ever. And it's a song that he absolutely loves. And he said that he plays it every night, and that's just amazing, what your imagination can come up with. Here's another website that's really popular.

[00:08:23.870] - Gabby
It's Copy Blogger. Brian Clark came up with this website when he was studying copywriting, and he wanted to get these principles of copywriting out there. It started out where the site was just based on copywriting, but it's expanded into so much. Now they do hosting. They came up with a plugin called Scribe that helps people optimize their blog posts for SEO. And they've expanded beyond there to create several marketing courses. So, your imagination can do so much.

[00:08:57.530] - Gabby
You just have to tap into your creativity and make your product as unique as you are. It doesn't matter if you think that you know other people are more creative than you. Try not to look at what other people are doing. Just focus on you and what makes you unique, your story, the love that you put into your product, your creativity. As you get into that place of tapping into your creativity and into play.

[00:09:23.690] - Gabby
You will really enjoy the process of creating products. And you'll want to create them more and more and more as you get into it. So, let's get into the meat and bones of this class and how to get ideas. So, first, you want to know what your learning style is. Are you visual? Do you see things and then you come up with ideas.

[00:09:45.410] - Gabby
Maybe you see websites, or you see performances, or you see a movie and you come up with ideas. Are you more auditory where you can listen to an audiobook and get a bunch of ideas from that? Or maybe you listen to a Ted talk or you listen to some song and you get ideas from that. Are you kinesthetic? And you actually have to go through the process of learning like, you go through the process of learning what it is that you do.

[00:10:14.810] - Gabby
Maybe you do social media. You go through the process of learning social media, and that's how you learn and you see different connections from doing that. Or are you all up to above? Maybe you use all of these different ways to learn and to develop your own type of process for creating products. So, whichever one it is, you can also look at these websites to get more ideas.

[00:10:41.990] - Gabby
So, there's Pinterest. And Pinterest has a ton of products on there and blog posts that you can go and get a bunch of ideas. So, here's an idea of how it works. I just typed in planners and then look at all of these different pins that come up that are exciting. And look at all of the different ideas. There's self-care.

[00:11:05.570] - Gabby
There's gold tracking. Look, there's a water type of tracker. There's a weekly planner, so you can see there's a daily planner. There's all kinds of ideas that you can get just from looking at that. Then there's Etsy.

[00:11:20.930] - Gabby
And the same goes for Etsy. You can use Etsy to really quickly find so many different ideas. So, I just typed in planners on Etsy, and you can see that there's a digital planner. There's another digital planner. So, it looks like digital planners are really popular right now.

[00:11:40.130] - Gabby
They're coming up on the first page when I typed in Planner, there's also ADHD planner, a life changing planner. The everything bundles to plan your life. There's tons of ideas that you can get just from typing in your keywords on Etsy.

[00:11:58.910] - Gabby
So, for more visual elements, I like going to creative market, and they have published that usually their most popular products are shown on the first page. So, if you scroll down, you can see what some of the staff picks and then really popular graphics here. So, this can give you ideas of what to create, or it can also give you design ideas as well. So, you can see some of the popular fonts right now, and looks like those are some blog posts. So, there's some design trends, color of the season.

[00:12:38.210] - Gabby
So, if you come on here and you choose whichever category you want to look at, these are the ones that show up on the first page are usually the most popular. So, you can get some ideas from Creative Market as well. And then, of course, there's Google. So, if you go to Google and you type in your keywords, you can see that Google will populate other keywords right behind the keyword that you put in. So, there's planners 2021, planners for men, which is a different segment of the market that might be good to tap into.

[00:13:14.870] - Gabby
There's planners for kids, planners with stickers, planners Aaron Conrad, planners that start in July, and planners for work. So, there's a lot of different ideas that you can get from Google that you might not have thought of before, like, I wouldn't have thought that kids need planners. But if you think about it, the school that my youngest daughter goes to, they do give out planners at the beginning of the year to help them keep track of their homework. So that could be a good idea to create some planners for kids.

[00:13:49.430] - Gabby
Planners with stickers are popular. So, if you scroll down, you'll also see pages that you can click on. There's planners at Target. There's planners on Amazon. Those are both great sites to also get ideas from and check out as well as looking at the ads here in the Google ads, the Google Shopping Marketplace. You can get ideas from these to see what people are listening in the ads.

[00:14:14.510] - Gabby
And then if you scroll down, you can find even more ideas from some of these different websites. If you click on them, you'll probably find a shop full of different planners, so you can get ideas from what they're listing as well.

[00:14:32.330] - Gabby
I always visit my competitors to see what it is that they're listing because they give me ideas as well. They might cover a topic that I haven't covered and then I'll think, oh, I really want to do that. Oh, that's a good topic. You know schedule it put it in my schedule and then done. I've got an idea, you know right there.

[00:14:55.610] - Gabby
You don't have to be alone doing this. You can look at other people's stuff and get ideas from that. That's what product development is all about. I've actually worked in product development before, and that's what we would do. We would look at what competitors were doing and try to mimic it or try to come up with our own recipes.

[00:15:15.290] - Gabby
So, we would try to come up with our own recipe you know based on what they were doing or something different. We look at all kinds of different industries, not just our industry, but Google can be helpful for that to find a lot of different related products in different industries that you might want to check out. And see if you can get some ideas from your competitors or from other industries. Amazon is a great place to go to as well because they have all of the popular planners listed right here on the front page.

[00:15:50.030] - Gabby
You can see that this one has 900 reviews.

[00:15:53.330] - Gabby
So, it's probably if we think that reviews maybe like 10% of people who buy it, 10% to 20% will actually post a review. So, if you times that by more than or 100, that's possibly, you know a lot of people who have bought close to 10,000 people who have bought this planner, if maybe 10% of them left or actually it would be more than that, wouldn't it? If all of these people had bought it. So, you can look at these different products on Amazon and get an idea for what's popular based on the reviews and see what people really like.

[00:16:34.370] - Gabby
It looks like a lot of people really like the style here. It's just a 2021 planner, but it has a nice cover that's really pretty as well as this one with the flowers.

[00:16:45.110] - Gabby
So, if you're looking for design ideas, then this might be a good, you know way to go to put some flowers or some kind of marbly-looking texture on the front cover of the plant that you're creating. Another idea is to use PLR, which is private label rights products, also known as Done for you products. So, PLR can come in blog posts, there's courses, there's planners, there's journals, and digital planners, and all kinds of other products that you can use to easily create your own product from. So, another idea to get ideas is to take breaks.

[00:17:23.090] - Gabby
Like I was telling you that I went to the movies as my break, and that was really helpful for me to get an idea of what I wanted to create for this course. And I wasn't really looking for an idea, but somehow it just landed in my consciousness and I was able to go with it.

[00:17:39.050] - Gabby
I recognized that it was the connection that I needed for this course, so be sure to take breaks. Stephen King would often take walking breaks, and during his walking break, if he was frustrated with something that he was writing, he usually got the idea that he needed to continue writing whatever he was working on after he took the walking break. So, be sure to take some breaks there's also, you don't have to just walk. You can watch movies, even sleeping can help, doing the dishes, doing the laundry, cleaning your house, all of that stuff helps, or even exercising.

[00:18:15.170] - Gabby
So just take a break and let things settle so that you will have fresh ideas in your mind. It somehow seems that your mind will just work it out for you if you ask it to most of the time.

[00:18:28.850] - Gabby
So, let's get into how to channel your ideas into products using a three-step process.

[00:18:36.230] - Gabby
The first step is to brain dump all of your ideas onto paper. So, as you brain dump all of your ideas, then you'll have a list of ideas you can go back to at any time and create your products from. The second thing is to organize what it is that you brain dumped onto your paper. So, I like to ask three questions. Who is it for?

[00:19:01.370] - Gabby
Why is it needed? And how will this be different from other similar products? So, as I'm asking that, then I'm able to organize it. Organize the product list that I have into the target markets that I want to hit or the solutions that I want to provide to their problems. So, as I'm doing that, it's better.

[00:19:22.850] - Gabby
I'm able to organize it easier so that I can come up with you know not do the same thing every time. you know I can come up with a product that's maybe based on health and wellness, when the next product might be based on spiritual growth, and then the next product might be based on business and marketing. That way you space out what it is that you're doing. So, you're not always doing the same thing exactly. Of course, there is steps that your clients might want to take. So, if they take intro to Tarot.

[00:19:55.490] - Gabby
Maybe they want to take the next step, which is like how to create your own business from your passion. And the third step is to finally take action. You can see this little girl. She looks so happy with the painting that she did and the heart that she drew from the action that she took. But she wouldn't have felt this way if she didn't take any action at all.

[00:20:18.590] - Gabby
So, make sure to take action on your product idea. It's best to set a deadline, put it in your phone, put it on your schedule right now when you're going to have your product created. Because you will start to want to meet that deadline and move forward on creating your product. Believe me, this works. This helps me so much. If I put a deadline on there, and especially if I have affiliates who are counting on me to produce this product, then I will get it done. Because I know that I have to get it done in order for it to get out there.

[00:20:56.210] - Gabby
Then the next thing is to decide what you need to get done. So, are you going to create it yourself, or are you going to outsource? How much time do you really have you know, so decide if you have the time to create it yourself, go for it. If you don't, then get help and support along the way.

[00:21:18.350] - Gabby
You can go on, you know you can hire different parts of the puzzle of the product that you're trying to create. If you're trying to create a course, maybe you want to get PLR to help you with the course content. Or maybe you want to hire a copywriter to help you write part of the course content so that you have that done. And then all you have to do is record the video. Or maybe you need to hire somebody to do the video for you. Or maybe you need to hire somebody to do the graphics and marketing for you.

[00:21:51.830] - Gabby
You don't have to do everything. You can split it up into bits and pieces that will help to make the product whole if you need to. If you don't have a whole lot of time, the main thing is to really get the product done. So, I had to learn this the hard way. Outsourcing was hard for me.

[00:22:11.930] - Gabby
I did things all by myself for years, but I wasn't really getting anywhere because I wasn't able to produce on my ideas as much as I wanted to because it was just me you know. And I also had other things I had to do. And so when I learned about outsourcing and I realized, oh, I can pay someone $75 and earn $750, I was a yes to that. I was like, yes, that makes sense to me. I only spend 10% and I earned $750.

[00:22:49.850] - Gabby
So, it was a yes. So, if you feel like you can pay someone $75 and earn however much it is that you will make from your product. Even if you only make $200, you still got a profit. If you make $750, you've got a great profit if you make even more than that. Let's say that you are really great at marketing and you make $20,000 off of it.

[00:23:16.130] - Gabby
That was worth it, wasn't it? So make sure that if you need to outsource that you do that and look for the people, then that you need to create it. So, the next thing is to do your thing and create your product, produce it and get it out there, even if it isn't perfect. How many versions of this character? Rosie the Riveter have we seen online?

[00:23:40.730] - Gabby
There's so many different ones, but yet someone created even another one, and it may not be perfect, but it's still out there. Get your stuff out there, then you will get paid for it as you go for it. And that's what you need to do to create your business and to make money off of your ideas. So just to recap, we talked about using your creativity, which is part of you tapping into that creative side within you, brain dumping your ideas onto paper and getting all of that out of you so that you have a list of products.

[00:24:18.650] - Gabby
You can probably come up with a list of products that will last you for a year, maybe even five years.

[00:24:24.710] - Gabby
You never know if you really sit down and you brain dump your products, you could probably come up with at least a list of good ten products to produce and to come up with however many products you're able to generate and to have ideas for, just go with it. Keep writing, keep typing, whatever it is that you're doing to get your product ideas out there, keep doing it. Look on Google, look on Etsy, look on Creative market, if that's right for you, look on Pinterest and get ideas for all of your products. And then put them on the paper so that you have a list of product ideas that you can go to.

[00:25:04.670] - Gabby
The next thing was to organize your ideas, go with the ones you think that people would really want first. You know you can always pull your audience and see what it is that they want. If you pull them, then they know also that they're expecting a product from you that is related to what they really want. So, if you do that, then you already have a set of people who are looking forward to what you're creating.

[00:25:32.450] - Gabby
And even if you don't pull your audience, go with what you feel is the right product for you to create right now. You can always start from the beginning of what you think that your audience or your customers need and create that. Then the next thing for our recap is to take action, set that deadline, do it today, set the deadline. If that's the only thing you do today, then do it because your mind will start to be reminding you that you have this deadline that's coming up and you need to reach it.

[00:26:03.830] - Gabby
So, make sure to take action on your product ideas and then put it out there and I know you've got this.

[00:26:11.030] - Gabby
