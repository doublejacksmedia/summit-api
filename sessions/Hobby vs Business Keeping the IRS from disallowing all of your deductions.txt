Hi, welcome to Hobby VS Business, how to keep the IRS from disallowing your deductions. My name is Nayo Carter Gray. I am the owner and founder of First Step Accounting, where we make accounting a little less taxing for small business owners all across the US. We're located in Baltimore, Maryland, and we serve tons of small business owners. I am an enrolled agent. What that means is I'm licensed directly by the U.S. Treasury. I can handle tax matters in all 50 states. I am also currently sitting for the CPA exam. Covid kind of messed up my four-part test. I have one part left, so cross your fingers for me that I pass within the next couple of weeks. I do have an accounting degree, so accounting has been my livelihood and lifeline and for years I am a Quick Books online advanced certified proadvisor. I actually sat on the Intuit Accountants Counsel. I currently sit on their Trainers Writers Network. And what this means is that I actually help them build and develop the software, not only for accounting users, but also small business users. And I teach it nationally, again, not only to account users, but also small business users. I was named one of the top fifty cloud accountants by a company called Hubach two years in a row. Last year was named one of the top one hundred text Twitter accounts to follow by Forbes and just recently named by a practice technician as one of the top 50 women in accounting. So, I take accounting very seriously, and I love working for small business owners, which is why I am oh, I am so excited to be teaching this course.

[00:01:56.830] - Nayo
Now, small business owners are so notorious for not having good financial records, and it's because you guys are so busy building your businesses that you kind of forget and neglect the back office stuff. But I want to re-emphasize, and I'll keep saying this over and over the out time here, that having your finances and accounting records in working condition is going to be so huge, and beneficial for your business. Not only will it help you to manage your business, but it'll keep the IRS off your back, as you will learn today.

[00:02:38.020] - Nayo
So, having those good records, what they do is they actually legitimize your business, because if your business is ever classified as a hobby, it actually can limit how much in expenses you can deduct. And you will hear me again emphasize it is so important that your business has its accounting records in order, so that you do not get classified as a hobby.

[00:03:06.610] - Nayo
Now, if you own a business, I am strongly encouraging you to seek out an accounting professional. This course here is just general advice. And so if you want to tailor this conversation to your specific interest in your specific situation, you need to reach out to an accounting professional or tax professional. And I will give you my contact information later if you're in the market for one.

[00:03:35.980] - Nayo
Now, by the end of today's webinar, what you will learn are:

[00:03:40.870] - Nayo
The nine questions the IRS asked, in order to determine if your business is actually a business.

[00:03:47.530] - Nayo
How being classified as a hobby, impacts your tax return.

[00:03:52.330] - Nayo
And then, three things you can do right away, to ensure that your business avoids being classified as a hobby in the future.

[00:04:01.540] - Nayo
So, let's dive on in with the last questions. Question number one, do you carry on the activity in a business like manner? And this is so important because it will determine whether or not the IRS, will classify you as a hobby. And so, what does that mean to operate in a business like manner? It means that you have set hours, you are actually working on the business at certain times and people can get a hold of you using business communication methods, emails. Do you have a website? Do you have a telephone number that's not just your cell phone number that you use for business? Do you have business cards? All of those things can prove to the IRS that you're actually taking the business seriously and that you are operating in a business like manner.

[00:04:59.230] - Nayo
Now, as I go over these nine questions, I do want to iterate that none of these tests alone will make the determination whether or not the IRS treats you like a hobby, but it's like a combination of the questions. So, as we go through this list, you kind of think about how you're operating now and then what you can do to improve in the future.

[00:05:23.200] - Nayo
So, let's go head over to question number two. Does the time and effort you put into the activity indicate that you intend to make it profitable? What does that mean? That means are you actually taking time to sell your product or your service?

[00:05:45.910] - Nayo
Because, you know, we can have a business where we're buying a bunch of things and trying to write them off. But if you never make an effort to make a sale, then that screams to the IRS that this isn't a real business. So, again, do you have a website where people can hit the buy now button? Are you making calls to try to sell to people who would benefit from your product? You can prove that you are trying to actively sell the product via social media, via email, via the telephone. Then you will have a chance of winning this question over [laughs].

[00:06:29.920] - Nayo
The next question: Do you depend on the income from this activity for your livelihood?

[00:06:38.470] - Nayo
What does that mean? That means are you using the money you've earned in this business to pay your bills? And this is an important factor, because if you aren't, it could indicate that you could be just doing this for fun or again, you're just looking some write offs to try to minimize your other primary source of income, so I do again, and recommending that you have an accounting, a bookkeeping system, so that you can prove that the money you generated, you're spending to actually pay yourself to pay your bills, whether it's your mortgage, your car payment or something like that.

[00:07:17.980] - Nayo
Like when I first started a business, I used to do level marketing and I started because I wanted to pay my car note. I had just purchased a brand new car, and I was very adamant that I didn't want to take my salary and pay that car note. And so I started multilevel marketing where I did two events a month that covered my car note and it wasn't a hobby because I was actually using it to pay the bills.

[00:07:46.270] - Nayo
So, if you can prove that you will have success in winning this question over the next question, are your losses due to circumstances beyond your control or are they normal in the startup phase of your business?

[00:08:05.710] - Nayo
Now, the IRS does realize and understand that not every business will make a profit, especially not in the beginning. So, they do make allowances for your business to have losses. And there are certain industries that just lose money all the time. So like, for example, if you buy, sell and trade horses or you raise them typically horse horse racers, I don't remember the technical term, but they are businesses do not turn a profit unless that horse actually wins one of the major races like the Preakness. So the IRS has rules in place where they understand that this type of business may not show profits in a number of years. And again, if you're just starting the business, they're not expecting you to come out the gate making six figures because they know you have to do things on it in order to generate sales.

[00:09:01.930] - Nayo
So, again, ask yourself, are your losses beyond your control or are you in the normal startup phase of the business? And if your answer is yes, you probably will win this question. But again, you have to be able to prove that you're attempting and trying really, really hard to turn a profit.

[00:09:25.150] - Nayo
Next question. Do you change your methods of operation in an attempt to improve profitability? So, remember, we talked about those losses. Are you now switching things up to try to minimize them as much as possible? So, have you increased your prices? Have you brought in new things to sell as add ons? Have you improved the product? So, did you do a beat around and then got feedback and made that product better than increase the price?

[00:10:00.460] - Nayo
So if you can prove that you actively are working on improving the profitability long term, then the IRS again will well look favorably upon this question. But if you're just charging the bare minimum for the product, then you know you're charging less than what it costs for you to make. That probably will indicate that you're not trying to turn a profit.

[00:10:24.670] - Nayo
So, again, the goal here is with businesses. Are you trying to make some money? Next question, do you or your advisers have the knowledge needed to carry on the activity as a successful business, so are you bringing on a team of professionals to work with you, alongside you to help you improve your process, improve the business, improve profitability?

[00:10:58.460] - Nayo
So, have you proven to hire someone so say bring on an accountant? Are you bringing someone on to help you look overall at your financial picture and make some assessments, and give you some advice about how to improve? If so, awesome. Are you taking courses? If you're a do it yourself or are you taking courses to improve the information you already know and make it better and take it to the next level? If so, awesome, you'll be able to win this question over. But if you are trying to hire a plumber to do accounting, that may not go over so well. So, when you're looking at your team and looking at not being classified as a hobby, you want to make sure that the people you're hiring or working with have the insight, the info and the knowledge to take your business up to the next level.

[00:11:53.680] - Nayo
Next question. Were you successful in making a profit in similar activities in the past? Now, if this isn't your first rodeo and this isn't your first business and you've done this before, were you able to turn a profit in the past because the IRS knows people, you may start one business and stop it and then go on to the next one. But if you're constantly having these failing businesses, then maybe business isn't for you. Maybe you are just running a hobby. And so they want to make sure that people who aren't really good at business aren't benefiting from, you know, just playing around in business and pretending like they want to be in business and getting all these write offs when the intent is really never to make a profit.

[00:12:42.550] - Nayo
So again, where are you able to make a profit in the past? If so, that looks a little favorable on you. So, don't try to show losses for multiple businesses. Multiple years is just not a good look next. That's the activity. Make a profit in some years. And how much profit does it make?

[00:13:07.270] - Nayo
So, again, the IRS knows that we have years where your income just may not be as favorable as the year before. Did one of your products go viral and explode in one year and then the next year kind of fell flat? If so, that's totally fine, because the idea, again, behind this is that you're actually making every effort you can to improve that profitability every single day, every single month, every single year. You're not just buying stuff and never selling again because your product is no longer viral.

[00:13:45.220] - Nayo
So make sure that you're documenting how you're trying to sell and who you're trying to sell to and then, you know, keeping track of all of that income as well as your expenses, because it'll be important to determine the answers for all of these tests.

[00:14:04.420] - Nayo
Next and last. Can you expect to make a future profit from the appreciation of the assets used in the activity? And this one is less dive a little deeper because it's like, what? What are we talking about here? So, first off, we're talking about assets. We hear quite often that people buy equipment for their business.

[00:14:29.950] - Nayo
Now, is the equipment that you're purchasing going to be a benefit to the business to make your profits increase? So, are they going to appreciate which means go up in value to make your business run better? So, for example, if you run a snowball stand and you buy a vehicle, if you buy a Lamborghini, how is that going to benefit the business? Because snowball stands don't need Lamborghinis. You probably could benefit from a pickup truck that has a hitch on it where you can pull a trailer or be able to use the back of the cab to be able to buy supplies in bulk. So, think about the items and the supplies and the equipment you're buying and your business and ask yourself, is this going to help increase my profit or is this something that I am just wanting just because and it has no benefit to the business? So, keep this in mind. This is the last question is, is actually one of the more important ones? Because I know we get advice all the time to small business owners that you need to buy the right equipment. So, making sure that equipment is ordinary and necessary and that is actually going to help you increase your profits is huge and key.

[00:15:49.480] - Nayo
Now, I go over all of these questions because if you're classified as a hobby, it has a different impact on your tax return versus you being classified as a business, and it's not in a good way. So, being classified as a hobby means you get absolutely zero business deductions. Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed a couple of years ago, it eliminated the section of the tax return where you could, in fact, deduct any hobby expenses. And then in the past, those hobby losses were still limited by 2% of your what's called your adjusted gross income. And they had to meet like a threshold if you itemize versus the standard deduction.

[00:16:41.650] - Nayo
So, as you hear, it's not simple. It's a little complex. Oh, it was a little complex. Now, if your business is classified as a hobby, you get. Absolutely. Zero deductions. Nadda. Nilch.  It's not happening, but you will be required to report the total happy income so you don't get to write the expenses off, but you got to pay taxes off on the income. That's not cool because think about it. You've spent money on these expenses. Don't you want to be able to deduct them against the income you've earned? Like, I would be devastated if I spent a bunch of money on expenses for my business and the business got classified as a hobby. And then I didn't get to take any deductions, but I had to pay taxes on that income. So, I don't want that to happen to you. So, make sure you're reviewing these nine questions and checking things off on your list to make sure that you're operating as a business and not in jeopardy of being classified as a hobby.

[00:17:45.670] - Nayo
Now, I'm going to give you a few tips on how to avoid being classified as a hobby, and making sure that your business is operating as a legit business.

[00:17:59.680] - Nayo
So, first things first. I want you to keep track of all your appointments and why is this important? One, it shows that you are operating professional like so you have a calendar. Here's the schedule. Also, you could be keeping track of the time you're spending on the activities in your business. So, I love time trackers, but I just put a few of the major schedulers on the screen here. Google Calendar is probably one of the more popular ones where you can, you know, sync up with other people, and making sure that you two are meeting at the same time. And some of the other more popular ones. Calendaly, Book like a Boss, Vcita, MeetFox, and Microsoft Team bookings. So, all of those will allow you to be able to operate your business in a professional like manner where your scheduling with clients and customers and and keeping track of it, because generally you can print out a report that proves what your schedule looks like.

[00:19:03.200] - Nayo
So, if you're working a nine to five and then you come home and you're working on that business and you are setting up appointments again, you got a nice Canva record to say this is what I did and this is how I did it, and this is who I met with.

[00:19:19.720] - Nayo
And then I love the scheduling software because they can automate things. So, one of the things I am most passionate about is about automating and delegating and making things easy. Breezy Lemon. So, first things first. Make sure you are keeping track of all your appointments and tracking your time that you're spending in the business.

[00:19:44.110] - Nayo
Next up, use a separate bank account for your business and personal transactions. When you put those things together, if all of those things are jumbled up in one bank account, the IRS calls this comingling. And this is a no-no, because then they get to come in and say, "Hey, we don't know which transactions are actually business. So, they're all personal." So, we want to avoid that at all cost by making sure you separate them. So, it doesn't have to be a fancy business bank account. It can be another separate checking account that you use at the same bank you bank with personally. And I quite often recommend that to business owners who operate a single member LLC or have a sole proprietorship, because it just makes it easy and convenient for you to be able to transfer money between the two accounts.

[00:20:39.820] - Nayo
So, if you're using the income for your livelihood and all of your personal expenses are coming out a different account, then as you're earning income, that income funnels into this new separate bank account and then you just transfer over what you need to your personal account. Plus, you'll have the benefit of keeping all the expenses for the business in that one account. And when it comes time to track it, it makes it super, super simple because they're all neatly tied in one account, one by one place to check. This not only goes for your bank accounts, but it also goes for your PayPal accounts. And I know, my small business owners are so famous for commingling the PayPal account with personal business transactions. But I highly recommend you set up two separate accounts and use one for personal and one for business. I can't reiterate this enough.

[00:21:38.350] - Nayo
And for the love of all things, please do not use cash for business or Venmo. Both of these are actually personal accounts and in their terms of service is a violation. If you use it for business, I do know that cash does have a business version, which is nothing but square. So, if you're going to use one of these apps to collect payments from your customers, make sure you are using the business versions and again, separating them from your personal transactions.

[00:22:16.830] - Nayo
Lastly, and the most important one, I will advocate this every day, all day, because I know how this will help you not only keep your business classified as a business, but it will also help you build and grow your business. It will help you stay in compliance for all things tax. It is creating a formal bookkeeping system. And I will say it again. This is one of the things I will always highly encourage and recommend, because it not only helps you stay in compliance with taxes, but it also helps you manage the business and keep your business classified as a business.

[00:23:00.990] - Nayo
So, you may be currently using in an informal bookkeeping system, which is using something like an Excel spreadsheet or a Google sheets or numbers, pages, whatever it is that you're using that isn't automated, that has a lot of manual data entry; that is called an informal bookkeeping system. And it's nothing wrong with that. You can totally start there. However, I want you to take it to the next level and prove that your business is operating as a business by setting up a formal bookkeeping system. And most of you are familiar with Quickbook's as probably one of the more popular apps out there for the bookkeeping systems. But there's some other options out there. You can look at Wave Accounting, you can look at Sage, or you can look at Xero. All of these are cloud based apps that will help you manage the accounting and bookkeeping for your business. And I like these systems, one, because, like I mentioned, they they will automate your- automate the process for you. What they normally do is link with your bank account and pull in those transactions, so that you don't have to manually key anything. Because the issue with manually typing data is what happens if you type something wrong. Where is the checks and balances? There aren't any. But with a formal bookkeeping system, it'll pull in that data for you so you don't have to manually type anything. And there's a way to reconcile monthly, so that way you can just verify that the information in the bookkeeping system is actually what happened. And then at the end of the year, you have the beautiful financial statement that you can use to then file your tax return. Or if you're trying to do something like get a loan, here's a financial statement that you can print out for your loan officer or your banker and say, "This is how well my business is doing." They will appreciate and love that, because then you look like a professional. You have a document here that is showcasing how your business is doing. Then also, you can use this to make management decisions. How will you know what your business is doing if you don't know your numbers?

[00:25:21.720] - Nayo
So, if you've ever watched a show like Shark Tank, you know, that's one of the first things they ask. Do you know your numbers? So, having a formal bookkeeping system will allow you to be able to pull that information directly from your bank, manipulate it into a beautiful profit and loss statement, a balance sheet, and look and see how well or how bad your business is doing, so that you can make improvement and change your processes. And again, this will keep the IRS off your back.

[00:25:51.090] - Nayo
You have a profit and loss statement. This kind of legitimizes what you're doing. And that's the whole point of this webinar today, is to teach you how to legitimize it so that you understand exactly what it is you want to avoid at all costs so that your business does not get classified as a hobby. So, I'm going to say this once again, set up that formal bookkeeping system. It is imperative.

[00:26:19.830] - Nayo
Now, I do you have a special offer for you because you've stuck it out this long and listen to me, blah, blah, blah, all about the IRS and the things they look for in order to not give you the deductions you are entitled to. That I want to offer my assistance for if you need extra help in this way. And how am I going to do that? I have a special course called "The Business a Bookkeeping Boot Camp". And what it does is we kind of go over some of the accounting basics so that when you are setting up their formal bookkeeping system, you know exactly what it is that you're doing.

[00:27:08.670] - Nayo
So, there are three handed lessons. Lesson one focuses on income and cost of goods sold. Now showcase this wonderful what I call a "love letter from the IRS". When you're not reporting your income correctly, you could get one of these notices is called the CP2000 notice. And as you see on the screen, she got a notice saying that she owed thousands of dollars. Now, what would you do if you saw a letter like this? Probably freak out like she did. And luckily for her, she hired me and I got this number down immensely. By the time it was over, she only owed a couple of hundred dollars. And again, it was because she didn't report her income correctly. So, in the Business Bookkeeping Bootcamp, we teach you how to report all of the income that you're supposed to. We also go over the cost of goods. And what that means is if you're selling a product, you need to know the value of those products and what's actually tax deductible, because it may not always be the all the things that you purchase. You may have to spread those costs out. But again, we teach that in the course.

[00:28:17.680] - Nayo
The next lesson focuses on the expenses. Expenses are huge because there are some things that will just trigger an IRS audit because they just look wonky. So, if we look at these expenses here, a website that costs almost $20,000, that's like a big red flag. So, I go over in this course the general business expenses that most businesses are eligible for, and we talk about what it means for them to be ordinary and necessary in order to be tax deductible.

[00:28:53.290] - Nayo
And lastly, we cover some tricky tax topics and there are a few of them that I like to reiterate over and over to make sure that you understand exactly what's required in order to take those deductions. Because if you take them incorrectly, they could trigger a red flag for the IRS and trigger that audit. And we want to avoid that. Plus, with the pandemic hitting and we received all of these stimulus packages and PPP loans, there are some other things that are coming down the pipeline that will impact your tax return for your business income and expenses. So I want to make sure you know exactly what those are.

[00:29:36.370] - Nayo
Now, as a bonus, if you buy the course, you'll get a Facebook group with me and other small business owners where we talk about some of these topics throughout the year. You get lifetime access to any updates or improvements I make to the course and you get a free bonus course on how to find the right bookkeeper if you're in the market for a new bookkeeper.

[00:30:00.400] - Nayo
Now, how much is this going to cost? Well, today for you only with the special discount code, "Breakthrough" it is only going to be $99. 12 months of bookkeeping, this course alone and the Facebook group will cost you over $3000. So, this is a steal and again, it's a tax write off and is helping you prove that your business is a business because then you're trying to get the knowledge to make sure your back office stuff is all set up. Right. And I hope to see you there.

[00:30:35.160] - Nayo
