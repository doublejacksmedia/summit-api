Hey there, and welcome to today's presentation. I'm super excited to dive into your blogger playbook, how you can level up your blog beyond ads and after qualifying for ads. Now, I know as bloggers, qualifying for ads is the golden standard. It feels like the goal that you are trying to get to probably from the time that you start your blogging journey, or at least the time when you start to want to make a business out of this blogging thing that you are spending all of your time on. And the reality is, though, when you qualify for ads, that is really just the beginning of your journey, and the beginning of what success might look like for you as a blogger. So, if you want to know the exact playbook that you need to level up your blog beyond 50,000 sessions when you've just qualified for ads, and I hope you'll stick around. To go off of that even more, you are in the right place today if you have at least 30,000 to 40,000 sessions on your blog monthly, which might mean that you're not quite qualifying for ads yet, but you're almost there. But my point in that is making sure that you have mastered a little bit of what it takes to grow your traffic with your blog, because that's going to be needed in some of the other things that we talk about today.

[00:01:28.550] - Madison
Second, you have likely monetized your blog in some way, and you are bringing in around a thousand dollars on average per month. This ideally is going to be through ads because we're going to talk about the strategies beyond ads. And ads are also a little bit more passive than some of the other strategies that we're going to talk about today. Things like sponsored content or affiliate marketing. So, it's important to have that type of passive income on your blog. You also want to continue scaling your blog. You are not done growing yet, and you are looking to refine your systems and build a sustainable business around your blog. And then lastly, you want to know what the secrets are to scaling your blog to multi-five figures and beyond. So, if any of those apply to you, stick around. I'm so excited to dive into this content today. Now just a quick introduction to me and who I am and why I know a couple of things about what I'm talking about today. My name is Madison Wetherill. I'm the founder and CEO over at Grace + Vine Studios, where we have been building custom brands and websites for bloggers, mostly in the food space since 2015.

[00:02:33.320] - Madison
And we have branched out a little bit in the last couple of years to also serve lifestyle and travel bloggers as well. And I also have two food blogs that I run that are another side of my life and my business. And I have been through the gamut with those blogs and through the journey that we're going to talk about a little bit today. I'm also a homeschooling mom to my eight-year-old and five-year-old, and I have a one-year-old as well. And something that you should know about me is that I'm very passionate, I'm very driven, and I love to take things to the next level. I do not sit still and let things be mediocre very well. So, we're going to learn a little bit today about how we can take our businesses to the next level. So, there are four things that you should focus on after qualifying for ads, and we are going to dig into each of these today. The first is that you're going to focus on building your brand and your email list, and I'm going to tell you how those two things are combined and connected. The second is to implement a keyword research strategy and to boost your SEO.

[00:03:34.380] - Madison
The third is to diversify your revenue streams, and then the fourth is to optimize your website. Let's dive right in. Number one, the first thing that you're going to focus on when you have leveled up to having ads on your website, you've reached that 50,000-session mark or more, is you're going to focus on building your brand and building your email list. At this point, you likely have quite a large amount of people who are coming to your website every month. And it might seem like you only have 50,000 sessions, and that might seem like a small amount of people until you really start to visualize what that would look like. I want you to imagine if you were sitting in an auditorium full of 50,000 people. They were all staring at you while you created a recipe, or shared about your favorite travel location, or showed them how to knit a scarf. That is a lot of people, and it would be quite overwhelming if that was in real life. We need to start thinking about that number differently, because it seems like such a big number as you're trying to grow your blog to qualify for ads.

[00:04:43.010] - Madison
And then it seems like the second we have that number and that ad level, we are wanting to grow it even more, which there's nothing wrong with that. But I just want to put into perspective how many people are already in your sphere. And we need to start thinking about what we're going to do with those people. The reality of blogging is that most people who come to your website are going to bounce. They're not going to stick around. They might view the one recipe or make the one craft, but a lot of the time they're not going to stick around. And some of that is just the nature of blogging. But I think bloggers are often overlooking the opportunity to convert these random visitors that are coming to your website into people who are truly a part of your audience, who are on your email list, and who ultimately care about what you are doing. But the very first step to being able to do that and even having that opportunity is making sure that your website is very clear, and people know what it is that you do and what your website is all about.

[00:05:41.780] - Madison
This starts with understanding your niche. Now, you've probably heard the word niche in the blogging space. We've all heard it. Really, your niche is the type of content that you share and how you are different from your competitors who are in the same space. I like to tell my clients there are really three levels to your niche. The very first top level of your niche is going to be the main topic you talk about. It's going to be food, or DIY, or travel, or lifestyle. Whatever that main topic is, that's the top level of your niche. Beyond that and below that is going to be more specific in that topic. It might be that you share healthy recipes or travel for couples, or maybe it is knitting projects for people who love to knit. Whatever that next level is, we're going to go one level even deeper than that. And I want you to think about if I had five different people in your space, in your same niche that talk about the same thing you do, all lined up in a row, how would your brand stand out and be different from your competitors?

[00:06:46.810] - Madison
Because that is really what your niche is. Your niche is your unique view and your unique stance on what it is that you do. And then once you've dug deep and figured that out, I want you to ask yourself if this is obvious from your website. If I were to ask your neighbor or your parents or a friend of yours what it is that your blog is about, would they even know? I don't know about you, but I have been in this situation many times, and probably more times than I would like to admit when I'm at a gathering or a holiday party or something like that and someone asks me what I do. And if I say that I have a food blog, they generally are going to say, 'Oh, that's really cool. What type of recipes do you share?' Now in the past, I have been guilty of stumbling over my words and maybe spitting out something along the lines of, 'Oh, just recipes that are good.' And while that is very embarrassing to admit as somebody who is in this space, and I don't do that anymore, it is much more clear to somebody if I'm able to say, I share wholesome, easy-to-make recipes for people who want to share food with those they love.

[00:07:50.720] - Madison
That is so much more clear and it paints a picture. And it also really helps people to know whether or not my site is for them. If I say that I am a Whole30 blogger who focuses on healthy living and you're not interested in that, you're not going to come to my site. If I have a knitting blog and you've never picked up a ball of yarn, you're not going to be interested in my site. So, our niche can really help to carve out the path for us of the type of people that we want to attract to our site, and ultimately who we want to join our email list and to be a part of our audience. So, be honest with yourself and ask, is your niche defined? Is it obvious to those around you? Is it obvious to your readers? I'll be honest, most of the time in the blogging space, I find that the answer is no. So, if you want people to know what your niche is and what your blog is all about, you have to first get clear on it for yourself, and then you have to share it everywhere and more often than you think you should share, so people know what it is that you do.

[00:08:50.920] - Madison
Step two is going to be to get people on your email list. I think growing your email list is something that is so underrated in the blogging space, because we are so focused on growing our traffic that we forget we should also be growing our email list, so that we have a little bit more control over our traffic, and over how we get people to our website. Really, as you grow your email list, you are reducing the risk you have as a blogger who is dependent on social media algorithms or organic traffic, Google algorithms, all the things to drive traffic to your website. You can help stabilize your traffic to your website and your traffic sources by having control over this portion of your traffic. But even more importantly than that, having someone on your email list is the key to engaging them and converting them into a raving fan of your blog. This is how you build relationships with your audience and how you can help serve them useful content, and helpful products that they are interested in through things like affiliate links, or even selling them products down the road directly. So, if you don't have an email list or a way for people to sign up on your blog, that's your first step.

[00:09:59.880] - Madison
You want to go and create a form. Maybe you need to sign up for a free email marketing account, create the form, and add it to your website just to start collecting email addresses. Now, if you do have an email list, but you haven't emailed them in a while, I want you to think through what it would look like to get started with that again. Now, I find people often have lots of nuanced questions about, 'Well, do I need to tell people why I haven't been emailing? Do I need to reintroduce myself? Do I need to do this?' Do whatever you're comfortable with. Whatever is going to help you to get over that hump of just getting started again, do that and then figure out what your new rhythm can be for emailing your people. Maybe it's once a month that you can stick to. I recommend at least once a week. And this is something that is actually so much easier to do than people realize. It's something that you can also use a tool like ChatGPT to help you with. And really you can simplify this process and just get into the habit of doing it on a weekly basis.

[00:10:53.700] - Madison
And then once you have a really engaged email list that you are sending emails too often, try selling something to them. Whether it is just sharing a favorite affiliate product or creating a digital product that you can sell to them, this is the next phase for you if you have been emailing your list regularly. Okay, so phase number two, or thing number two to focus on beyond ads is leveling up your SEO, and I want to share a little bit of an insight into my own keyword research strategy. Now I'll be honest, today we don't have time to dig as deep into keyword research and SEO as I might like to, but there are lots of other presentations this week on this topic, and there is lots of resources out there on this topic. But just briefly, what I want to go into is thinking about how to level up your keyword research strategy. Keyword research is such an essential part of blogging, especially those who are monetized with ads and looking to grow a larger source of traffic and you want your organic traffic to be your primary source. Once you have started to see some traction with SEO and probably the majority of those 50,000 sessions that you have to qualify for ads are coming from organic traffic, it's time to level up.

[00:12:07.190] - Madison
So, what I mean by level up is first, you want to figure out where your blog sits right now when it comes to keyword research, specifically around the idea of keyword search volume. In other words, what size keywords does your site currently rank for? Are they mostly really small keywords that are maybe under 1,000 searches per month? Or are you above 5,000? Maybe most of the keywords you rank for are 10,000, 25,000. Whatever the number is, this helps you to understand the average amount or the average keyword volume that your blog can easily rank for. Once you figure that out, you can start figuring out how to go for larger keywords and leveling up your old blog post to that next level organic search traffic. But basically, the reason this is important is if your blog currently only ranks for search volume of 500, you don't want to go for something that is a 20,000-volume keyword because your blog is just not at that level yet. You can have outliers where that happens, but most often, if you stay in your lane and in your range of keyword volume, you're going to see a lot more success. This is not only going to be fulfilling for you as a blogger, but it's also going to just help propel your entire blog into a higher space.

[00:13:23.320] - Madison
The third thing to focus on is diversifying your revenue streams. There is so much focus for getting ads on your site when you are getting started in their blogging journey, that sometimes you're not thinking about all of the other ways that you could make money from blogging. Again, this is another topic that I'm sure we have lots of presentations on this week, but I want you to just think about some other revenue streams that you might want to explore. You don't have to add all of these at once. Maybe you just choose one or two that you want to explore in this next year and start to make a plan for how to do that. Adding additional revenue streams can help do a couple of things for you. It can pad your income from just having ad revenue, because sometimes at the beginning level of ad revenue, you are not going to be generating a ton of money per month. So, going deeper and having more revenue streams can be really helpful. But it also again allows your audience to go deeper with you and to have more of a know, like, and trust factor with your audience when you have things that they can purchase from you and things that they can engage with you on.

[00:14:32.490] - Madison
They're not just going to be checking out one recipe and then leaving your site forever, but you're giving them an opportunity to become a part of your audience. This can also help your expertise and authority in a broad way. I'm going to talk a little bit more about expertise and authority in our step number four. But what I want you to consider is if you are an expert enough in your topic where you are able to create something of value to sell to somebody. That immediately adds you to a different level of expertise than somebody who maybe just started a blog yesterday, and doesn't know their topic well enough to do that. Here are a couple of things that you can consider as alternate revenue streams, or additional revenue streams that you can add to your business. You can do things like work with brands directly through brand partnerships that can be through social media content, or through blog content. You can also be creating content for brands. That's another form of brand sponsorship, where you have a little bit more freedom in what you can create for the brand based on what they're looking for, and you don't have to worry so much about organic search.

[00:15:37.640] - Madison
You could do things like affiliate marketing. This in and of itself is a whole different topic that has many, many points to it, so I won't go much into it, but it's a huge way that you can bring in revenue to your website and to your blogging business. You could create digital products or physical products depending on what your niche is. You could consider one-to-one training or services. This is definitely not going to be passive in any way, but it's a really great way to inject revenue into your business, and also get to know your audience on a really intimate level when you are working with them one-to-one. You could create a digital course of your content. So, if your content is something that you could create a step-by-step course for somebody to take, that's a great way to add revenue. You could consider something like an ad-free membership. Kind of an ironic thing to consider once you have ads to also then have a way for your audience to view your site without ads, but especially as you get to a place where you have a large amount of people coming to your site, this can sometimes make sense.

[00:16:37.540] - Madison
Lastly, you could consider hosting a summit just like the Summit that we're a part of this week. Hosting a summit for your audience is a great way to grow your email list and also to be able to share your expertise and knowledge with your audience. I went through those first three examples quickly because I wanted to save the very best for last. And the thing that I know the best about all of these topics, and the thing that I'm most passionate about, is optimizing your website. I truly saved the best for last, my friends. When it comes to leveling up your blogging journey and reaching for a new level of success, focusing on your website is 100% crucial. Your website for your blog is your virtual storefront. The better it looks and it feels to your readers, the better of an experience that somebody has on your website, the more likely they are to engage the first time or to come back. On the flip side of that is the negative version, which is if your website is not engaging, is intrusive with pop-ups and distractions, people are going to leave your site and never come back. This is bad for you, but it's also bad for the long-term growth of your business because it can be a signal to Google that your site is not built for users, and it will send less traffic to you because of that.

[00:17:56.140] - Madison
So, I want you to remember that SEO and keyword research are a huge part of bringing new users to your website. But having a website that is user-friendly and engaging is really the key to building long-lasting success with Google, like I just mentioned. If you are constantly having users bounce back to Google, it is a signal to them that there's something about your site that users do not like. This has just become so important in the last few years, in the last year especially, and this is something that is going to set you apart from your competition. So, if you are using the same theme that everybody else is using, you're using the same setup that everybody else is using, you are going to quickly find that you are not scaling to the next level of success because your blog is doing nothing different than the rest of your competitors. So, we're going to talk about three main components to do to optimize your website. The very first is to make sure that your website is organized. Sticking with our storefront analogy here, no one is ever going to be able to find something to buy in your store if it's disorganized and they can't find anything, or they don't know what the process is to go and check out.

[00:19:02.370] - Madison
There are so many analogies here. I just want you to think about the worst shopping experience you've ever had, and we do not want to do that on our website. Likewise, people are not going to engage with your website to come back to it or to recommend it if it's disorganized and unclear. We want to make sure again that your niche is clear on your website. That's something that is more of a content side of the organization in your website. We want to also make sure that people know what your website is about, and that they can easily find the content that you talk about. The categories that you have on your blog are very important to organize for your readers, but also for Google, because Google understands your website as a web, so they understand the little side arms of the web as your categories. They also understand it through your navigation menu. So, you want your navigation menu to be very clear and organized and feature your top categories and any index that you might have, whether that's a recipe index or a travel index. Your navigation really Google's eyes into your site and your site structure.

[00:20:07.890] - Madison
When it comes to your blog posts themselves, I find that using a table of contents on longer posts, especially anything over 1,000 words, can be really helpful for readers to find what they're looking for, or just to browse what it is that you have in that post so they can decide whether it's worth their time to read or not. And the best part about all of this, all of these examples of what I just said for organizing your blog, is that all of these things are going to help with your internal linking of your site structure, which Google is going to love as well. So, when it comes to having an organized website, focus on making sure that your categories are organized, your navigation is clean and organized, that you're having categories for each of the different buckets of content that you share, and then utilize things like a table of contents to make it really easy for your readers to digest your content. The second part of your website optimization is really focusing on a little something called E.E.A.T. Now, E.E.A.T is basically whether or not you are demonstrating that you have expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.

[00:21:16.840] - Madison
This is now a huge ranking factor for Google, and it's really important to make sure that this is a priority on your website. Google and your readers want to know that you are, one, a real person, but two, that you know what you are talking about. That is why in the food blogging space, especially, things like having process photos have become so important, having really detailed instructions about substitutions or storing the food, and things like that. All of that has become important because Google wants you to demonstrate your expertise in your topic. They do not want to just have random people who are making blogs and throwing up content that is not helpful in the long term for readers. The good thing about this, though, is you don't have to have any special degree. You don't have to have a fancy culinary degree or anything like that in order to showcase expertise. All you have to do is really show why you have knowledge in a subject. So, even if it's personal knowledge that you've just learned over time, that's still knowledge and expertise. You just have to share that with your readers and with Google through the different 'About' sections on your website.

[00:22:22.520] - Madison
I also want you to consider sharing content that has you in it. That shows that you are a real person - that AI did not create this content, but a real person did. If it's something like you being in the frame of the photo, maybe it's your hands making a recipe. It's you on the beach in the travel post that you're talking about. It's you making the DIY project. Whatever it is that can bring you into it. This doesn't have to be something you do on every single blog post, but make it frequent enough that it's obvious to your readers and to Google that a real person is behind this blog. You also want to make sure to highlight any reputable features that your blog has. If you have been mentioned in roundups by big companies, share that you have been featured in those places and share that on either a 'press' page or in an 'as seen on' section on your homepage. Anywhere that it's going to be obvious to somebody that you know what you're talking about and you create high-quality content. I also want you to make sure that you are optimizing the 'About' sections on your website.

[00:23:27.300] - Madison
I briefly mentioned that a second ago. You want to have things like your real photo of you, a high-quality photo. It doesn't have to be a professional branding photo shoot, but something that doesn't look like it was taken 10 years ago on an iPhone. You want it to be professional and up to date and what you look like now. You also want to make sure you have your first and last name. Again, we want to show that you are a real person, and saying that your blog is by Sally Q is not as relevant as having your full name there so that I could google you if I wanted to learn more about you. And then lastly, in those 'About' sections, make sure you are linking to your 'About' page, which is going to have more information about who you are and why your blog is helpful to your readers. The last section that we're going to dive into is creating an engaging experience for your readers on your website. It's hard to say which is the most important of all these things I've talked about, but this is the thing that I think is key - if you want to create a good experience for your reader, is finding a way to engage them with your content.

[00:24:27.820] - Madison
I've talked about this at length in my podcast, which is called The Vine Podcast, where I talk about things like user experience. But you really want to make sure you are creating a distraction-free environment for your readers. Now, of course, we have ads, we have pop-ups, we have things that we are sharing with our readers, so we're going to have some level of distraction, but we want it to still remain professional and limit the distractions as much as we can. So often I find that people don't even know that they have five or six things happening all at once in the first load of the website, because we are so used to looking at our website when we're logged in, or once we've cleared through all of those things, that we forget those things are happening for somebody who's brand new. So, make sure that you're not having a ton of those things happening on the first load of your site. And then you also want to make sure you are giving your readers what they want. I am sure you have seen all of the memes about food bloggers going on and on about their grandmother's birthday party and all of these things that aren't relevant to the recipe, but there's a reason for that.

[00:25:33.650] - Madison
Our society, unfortunately, has a very short attention span, and so we want to make sure we are getting people right to the heart of the content that they want. That's why jump-to-recipe button are so popular now. But even if you're not in the recipe space, there are things that apply to this as well. You might be a lifestyle blogger who can talk a little bit more about your life, but you want to also remember that people's time is very valuable. And so, if they're coming to you for your list of recommended products, make it really easy for them to get to those and to see them, and make sure that you are just creating an experience where it's easy for people to get to what they want. It's really about finding the sweet spot between having these things that generate revenue for our business, like pop-up ads or pop-ups, to grow our email list or ads and things like that, and creating an experience that our readers want to come back for. So, all that to say, make it really easy for people to get to the content they came for and utilize the space around that content.

[00:26:33.340] - Madison
So, if you're a recipe blogger, use your recipe card as the area in which you put important information, or important action steps that people need to take. Because that's what they're coming to your site for and they may not see the rest of the stuff in between until they are really committed to reading the blog post, and you want to make sure that you're getting their attention before they pop off and go do something else. Another really cool way that you can focus on engagement on your website is using things like block patterns. If you are not familiar with block patterns, this is a tool that is built into WordPress. This is a great way for you to add background colors, change font sizes, add graphics, all those kinds of fun things to jazz up the way that your blog post looks, which is going to help people to be engaged. It's helping to showcase your professional brand. And again, just help people to pay attention because they are moving fast, and they probably are not going to see your important content unless you make it really easy for them to see it and pay attention to it.

[00:27:30.120] - Madison
And then lastly, I briefly mentioned this, but make sure that you have a clear call to action around the main content of your blog post so that people will see it and hopefully take action - whether that is something like, 'Go and browse my recipe index; go and check out this other related blog post; leave a comment; share the post,' et cetera. Whatever it is that you want them to do, focus on putting that as close to the main part of the content that they're going to be paying attention to as you can. Now, if listening to this, you are sitting here and thinking, 'Wow, all of that sounds amazing, but I have a lot of work to do on my website. My website is not optimized in this way, and I don't even know where to start.' I want to share that the newest way that we are working with bloggers of all niches is through our crafted website offer. And crafted websites are basically built for bloggers who are looking to scale their blog to the next level. They want to focus on engaging their readers and creating a user experience that is memorable for their readers.

[00:28:29.320] - Madison
They also want to create a really unique look for their brand and not just be using the same pre-made themes that all of the bloggers are using. This is our budget-friendly way of working with us to create a customized website for your blog to take it to that next level. And so, I will put a link in the chat for you to check out our crafted websites. And if that is something that is of interest to you, we would love to chat with you and see if it is a good fit for us to work together. Now, I know that you are having so much information dropped on you this week, and my goal is always to really simplify things for my clients, for the people who listen to my podcast, and for you for being a part of this presentation. So, we have consolidated everything I've said in the last 30 minutes to you down into a little one-page PDF that you can download that has your quick action steps that you need to take for each of these things that we've talked about today. It is really the too-long, didn't read or too-long, didn't listen version of this presentation, because I had so much that I wanted to share with you today, and I tried to keep it as brief as I could, but I know it is a lot to take in.

[00:29:34.500] - Madison
