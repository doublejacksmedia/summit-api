Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for tuning in to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm truly honored to be here, and a huge shout out to Liz Stapleton for organizing such an inspiring event. It's always so amazing to me to see so many creative minds come together. My name is Kristin Rappaport, and I'm a graphic I'm a designer and founder of the Brand Boss Design Club, where I help online entrepreneurs take creative control of their brand and graphics. I'm here to guide you to that wow feeling and give you the confidence that turns heads and makes your brand unforgettable. I've been designing for a very long time, and it actually all started here in this lovely little program, Printmaster Gold Deluxe. I'll keep this gem forever because it's truly where my love for design began. Since then, I've designed ad agencies, in-house marketing departments, and for clients worldwide. But my favorite project to date has been, hands down, designing for my very own online business, and now teaching others how to do the same. Why? Because a graphic design isn't just a great skill to have in the online space. It can be a total game changer.

[00:01:21.330] - Kristin Rappaport
You've probably realized by now that just about every single thing you do to market your blog or online business involves some level of graphic design. And if it doesn't, it absolutely should. This is because people are naturally drawn to visuals. Did you know that your viewers make an instant decision whether they like or trust your brand in just seven seconds? And another alarming stat for you, approximately 94% of first impressions about your business are design-related, which means that your brand and graphics matter a lot. That's why I'm here, excited to teach you some simple, effective ways to make the most out of your time spent in Canva. Whether you're a long-time Canva user, or maybe you've just started exploring the magical world of design, I know that it can be pretty overwhelming. With so many tools and features, bells and whistles, you can quickly feel like a little lost kiddo in a candy store, right? But let me let you in on a little secret. It doesn't have to be this way. And that's why I'm so excited that you're tuning in to this training. Today, I'll walk you through how to set up your Canva account for consistent, easy to access branding across every project.

[00:02:29.060] - Kristin Rappaport
We'll streamline your your design process and boost your efficiency with the magical left panel. And of course, we can't have a Canva training without some super simple designer-level techniques that will elevate your graphics and ensure that you look like the professional you truly are. Are you ready to change the way you design for your business? Let's go.

[00:02:47.950] - Kristin Rappaport
Canva. It's intriguing but overwhelming, intuitive but easy to get lost in. Can I get a heck yes in the chat if you are lost in Canva? That's probably because you are not using the software wear the right way or in the most efficient way. And you could also use some sleek design technique. So first, let's talk about the setup of your Canva account. When it is set up correctly, you are going to save tons of time designing. You're going to be able to create much more consistent graphics. Stop recreating things and getting lost all the time in Canva. How many times have you been designing a graphic and you're like, Oh my gosh, I feel like I already have done something like this. If I could only just reuse it, why am I recreating things all the You'll have everything you need to create on brand graphics in just a few clicks. And of course, you're going to hopefully feel excited and confident about designing every time you open up Canva. First, I want to talk about setting up your brand kit in Canva and how you can actually use that to your advantage. If you haven't created your visual brand and have something that you absolutely love working with and it's easy to design with, you might have not set up your brand kit.

[00:03:57.620] - Kristin Rappaport
So once you have all of those important decisions made, you really, really should set up your Canva brand kit. It is the ultimate tool for maintaining brand consistency. It's going to keep everything organized, all of your colors, fonts, logos, all in one place, making it easy to apply your brand's look to any design project. It simplifies your design workflow and ensures consistency across all of your graphics and all of your documents. I want to quickly show you guys where you can find your brand kit and the types of things that you can add to it and some insider thoughts from my designer brain. From the homepage here, you just click into Brand. You need to click into Brand Kit. You can have multiple brand kits, which is really pretty cool. I'm going to go into my brand refresh folder. This here in your brand kit is where you can upload all of your logos variations. You can upload white versions, black versions, all of your different logos that you might use in any of your graphics or collateral. You can also upload your color palette. You just click into one of the circles, drop in the Hex code.

[00:05:00.020] - Kristin Rappaport
I do recommend that you put these in an order. Your core colors, your neutral colors, and then your action pop a color. That just makes the most sense in my designer brain. You can also add and set your brand fonts. You can set headline font, secondary headline, button text. These can be renamed to better suit your needs. Accent Font, Body Copy. They have option for quote and caption here as well. I do not worry too much about the size of the font because Because depending on the graphic that you're going to be creating, you're going to probably be changing the size of the font anyway. This is also where you can upload fonts. I always recommend checking out websites outside of Canva. My favorite is Creative Market. You can purchase fonts and then you can upload them into Canva here. This is also where you can set your brand voice. Just a hot tip for you guys, one way to do this is to feed ChatGPT all kinds of information about your brand, your business, the vibe and tone that you want to communicate in. You can also copy and paste social media captions or maybe marketing emails that you have sent into a ChatGPT conversation and ask it to analyze your brand voice.

[00:06:12.000] - Kristin Rappaport
Ask it for a short paragraph, and then paste that into this section. Below the brand voice is where you can add photos, graphics, and icons. You'll notice that I don't have anything in here, but you could add photos, graphics, or icons in here. One thing to note about adding things to this section, these are primarily for things that you are uploading. You cannot put any photos, graphics, icons, elements that are in the Canva element library or photo library into this section of your brand kit. This is basically for anything that you may have purchased or downloaded outside of Canva. Once you have your brand kit set up, I want to just quickly run through how and where you can apply the styles, the colors in any design that you're working on. Anytime you are working with a shape or a background or a font, you see the option up here to change the color. When you have your brand kit set up and your color palette in here, your brand colors are all just a few clicks away. You can add your brand colors to anything very quickly from the left panel here. Brand fonts.

[00:07:19.230] - Kristin Rappaport
Those are found a couple places. If you're working with text and you go into all of the Canva fonts, there's actually a section in here called 2024 Brand Refresh. So these are all of the fonts that I have set in my brand kit. So they're always easy to access right there. You can also access the fonts. If you click over into the far, far left panel, you can always see all of your fonts right here, and you can just very easily click and add them to your design. This way, you know that whatever project you're working on, your fonts are consistent with what you have decided for your brand image. In that brand kit is also where you have your brand voice. This is like Canva's mini version of AI/ChatGPT. Now, I've got just a text box here. I typed randomly, Importance of brand colors. We can click Generate in this brand voice. We're just going to generate. This is really great for getting your ideas flowing. Maybe you are putting together a lead magnet and you're like, Oh, I need some starter text. You can just type a little prompt in and Canva will write you something based on what you have input for your brand voice.

[00:08:31.530] - Kristin Rappaport
Here is the output, and then you can add it to your document, resize it, do whatever you need, make it fit in the place that you have. Sometimes I feel like one struggle with design is that you're also not a copywriter. And so it's like, I don't know what to type, I don't know what to write. That's a really great place to get some copy on your design or in your document without being a copywriter. And then, of course, you can tweak and edit it from there. Once you have your brand kit set up, you also have access to your logos, all of your logos, and you can quickly add these to any design that you are working on, resize them, move them, do anything you like. If you had brand photos uploaded into here, you would see them here in this section. Graphics and icons, same with them. And you could just click to add them to your design. So let me know in the chat, are you often using templates? I love templates. I usually recommend them for people who are just getting the hang of design. I also have a love-hate relationship with them.

[00:09:27.930] - Kristin Rappaport
It's sometimes fitting a a square peg into a round hole. Sometimes you just can't get your content to work. But when you have your brand kit set up, if you click into Design, it's at the very top of that left panel, and go into Style, you can jumpstart any template with your brand fonts and your color palette. So clicking through this color palette will give you some different options, and you can see how everything might look. It's like, Oh, I like that light background, or maybe, I want to go for a bold dark background. You can just shuffle through your color palette here. So brand fonts and colors can be easily and quickly applied to templates. As you begin repurposing more, you're going to find that you need to access your brand kit less and less. Obviously, if you're repurposing, well, things that you created once upon a time are going to be in the correct brand colors and hopefully using your up to date brand fonts. And so as you create more and more graphics that are on brand, you're going to be accessing less and less. So the next The first thing I want to talk about is your folder system.

[00:10:32.960] - Kristin Rappaport
Canvas folders help you keep your design projects and assets very, very neatly organized. With a free account, you can have two folders, and with a pro account, you can have unlimited folders. When you create your folder system, you can then organize your designs, images into specific folders. You can also create subfolders, and you can quickly locate what you need without sifting through hundreds of designs just to find that one thing that you are looking for. And this will allow you to focus more on creating and less on searching. I want you guys to know there's absolutely no right or wrong way to create your folder system. Everyone's business is different, and even more than that, everybody's brain works a little differently. So your goal is to create a folder system that just makes sense for you and your business needs. The important thing is that you know where you put things and you are able to find them quickly and it makes sense to the needs of your business. So if you create one folder, this is the one that it needs to be. In addition to setting up that brand kit, I highly, highly recommend that you create yourself a brand folder.

[00:11:35.830] - Kristin Rappaport
And inside this folder, you create subfolders for your most used design elements, stock photos, brand selfies, mockups of your digital products or your freebies, and anything else that you want to be able to quickly access. So let me go over into my brand folder. So here's my Kristin Rapp brand folder. I have got templates, I have got design elements. These are things like little stars and any fun graphics that you want to add to your design, so jazz them up a bit. Stock images. These are images that I have purchased, and I have them all in one very easy to access folder. I have brand photos of myself, and I have vanities and mockups. So Those are mockups of my membership and lead magnets and all kinds of things like that. I highly recommend that you create that brand folder. And as I mentioned earlier, in that brand kit where I showed you that I did not have photos and elements and icons uploaded into that section in the brand kit, it's because I have them in their own folder. That makes finding all of your branding elements really quick and easy to access. And a hot tip for you guys, once you have your folder system all set up, I want you to stay away from this home screen.

[00:12:46.960] - Kristin Rappaport
Let me know in the chat if you open Canva and you're like, Holy cow, there's so much stuff here. I'm looking for this one thing, I can't find it. This is basically all of your designs that you have ever created. My tip for you is to pop hop right into the Projects tab. This way you can get right to your folder, find your design that you need to work on, and get to designing. When you have your account organized, you can, Oh, I need to work on something for the brand bash. I can go into this folder and I've got all of my brand bash materials here in this brand bash folder. So it makes things very, very easy to access. And then you can stop feeling insanely overwhelmed when you open up Canva, you get to that home screen, and everything is everywhere. Now I want to talk about this magical left panel. Not only is a left panel, basically like your command center for design, but it houses just about everything you need. Text, you can access the element library, photos, images, videos, and anything that you've put into a folder that That projects button right here, you need to make that your best friend because that is where you can access anything and everything in your account.

[00:13:54.870] - Kristin Rappaport
And it functions amazingly when you have everything organized into folders. From the left panel, you can also quickly access that brand kit to grab fonts, apply the styles to templates, your brand voice, anything you've uploaded into your photos, graphics or icons. And you can access the Images, elements, designs or parts of a design that you've put into a folder in just a few clicks. And to me, this is really how you can streamline your design work. Let's create a quick graphic using my personal brand folder. So I'm going to into projects, and I'm going to go find Kristin Rapp brand. Most designs are jump started with a stock photo. I'm just going to go into all of my stock photos. I have tons and tons to choose from here. I'm just going to pick one to add to this background. I'm going to add a rectangle. Just click R on your keyboard to add a rectangle to a brand color and drop the transparency just a little bit. Now I'm like, okay, I have definitely got some headlines that I have designed in the past from. I don't want to start from scratch because I want to make sure that everything is staying consistent and looks like their little buddies seen on different platforms.

[00:15:08.650] - Kristin Rappaport
I'm going to go into my Templates and let's go find my Pinterest pin. Here's my pin template file. I'm going to click into that. As you can see, these are all of the pages in that other design file for my Pinterest pin template. I can click any image on here, and what it's going to do is it's going to add everything that was on that design file into this file. We're going to copy the text and we're going to paste that onto this document. Why recreate stuff when you've already done the work? In my opinion, it's like, if you design something once, let's get the most bang for our buck here. Now I've got this headline on my image here. When you do this, it's pretty common that you are probably going to have to resize some things to make them fit into your new layout. But the important thing is that you've got the same headline style or text style or or whatever it is that you're accessing from another design. You can stay really, really consistent all while saving yourself time. Why? Recreate when you've already done the work once. Then let's say maybe I'm creating a blog post graphic and I want to show off this free lead magnet that I've already designed.

[00:16:16.390] - Kristin Rappaport
I've already done mockups for the thing. I'm going to go into vanities and mockups, and then I'm going to go into this, what I call a mockup build file. In this document, I've created a handful of really nice mockups mockups that I could potentially add to any graphic. I'm going to go with this, Color Palette Starter Kit. I'm going to copy everything. Sometimes, Canva will automatically replace your current page that you're working on with whatever you're trying to add to it. I always just add a new page, and that way I know it's not going to delete my work. Now I've got this mockup on here. What can I add to jazz this up a little bit? I'm going to look for some design elements that maybe I've put into my design element folder. Let's pop into here and let's maybe do some of little stars over here, put them down here in the corner, and then maybe I want to add a little blobby thing here to ground this design. As you guys can see, anything that you put in a folder is very easy to access. Press right from the left panel, and you can reuse and repurpose within just a few clicks.

[00:17:22.190] - Kristin Rappaport
You can do this with headlines, you can do this with mockup files, you can do this with elements. As long as it's in a folder and you know where it is, you can quickly click and add to designs to make designing so fast and so much less painful. Let's jump into some designer-level techniques that anyone can do, even if you're not a graphic designer. I want to show you guys a simple background technique that I use quite often. I have created a folder, and these are the things that I'm going to be using to show you these techniques. In this folder, I've got images, I've got some designs I can access, and some JPEGs of some lead magnet. Let's quickly add a background. When you're working with a background, you really want to make sure that your text is readable on top of the background. So by dropping the transparency, and this is such an easy technique, but it produces great results just about every time. Drop that transparency down by clicking into that checkered box, and then you've got that slider there to drop the transparency a little bit. And now I want to add some text to this.

[00:18:24.820] - Kristin Rappaport
We're going to go with this dark text. Dark text on a lighter background is going to work very well You really want your text to be readable. Now I've got a really simple background, and you could add more things to this if you wanted to, but I love the look of that fated photo background. Likewise, you can also do this with a darker background. Let's grab that photo again. I'm going to click R to add a rectangle. This can be any one of your brand colors. Usually a darker color is going to work quite well for this technique. I'm just going to grab my darker brand color here. We're going to drop the transparency just a little bit. Now I'm going to go grab my white text. Let's add this to the page. Now we've got this white text right here on the page. One thing that I love to do to really just make your text pop is to add that text effect. It's the lift. I just feel like that little lift really makes your text pop. It's just a really nice, subtle, yet professional-looking design technique. So that's simple background technique. Number two is the photo in the back with a color overlay brand color on top, and white text.

[00:19:32.850] - Kristin Rappaport
Not only do I love sharing design techniques, I love sharing ways that make designing easier for you. How many times have you guys thought, Oh, my gosh, this is the perfect stock photo. I love this. I need to use this. And then You get it on your background and you're like, Okay, how am I going to work text into this? One thing that I always recommend that when you guys are looking for stock photos, think about how you're going to incorporate your text. Keep that in the back of your mind. Great photo. How am I going to work the text into it? Especially if you're designing a Pinterest pin or a blog post featured image. So I want to show you guys a real quick fix.

[00:20:07.010] - Kristin Rappaport
There's some empty space over here on the right, but there's clearly not enough space for me to put my text.

[00:20:13.260] - Kristin Rappaport
Any text that I put on here is probably going to be fighting with the wallet here. So a quick trick is to duplicate your photo, and then all you need to do is flip it. Flip it horizontal. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to bump this right up to the edge of that graphic. Then we can group these photos together and we can expand the photo to fit the space. All of a sudden, you've got a perfect area to add in your text headline. The next design technique I want to share with you is creating gradient fades. These have a magical way of leveling up any graphic that you are working on. I'm going to pop over to a new design document, and I'm just going to recreate this, and I'm going to show you how to work with these gradient fades. Let me click to my background image, and then I'm going to just click R to add a rectangle. And what I'm looking to do is add a white transition fade here. So I'm going to click into my rectangle. We're going to go into color. This is where you find the gradient.

[00:21:12.980] - Kristin Rappaport
So you need to click in to add new color. I don't know why this is hidden because it's such a great feature. And then go into gradient. So I'm going to make this white. You can also use this color picker to select any color in your background or your brand color. And then this one I'm also going to make to white, too. But the important thing here and the step that you don't want to miss is drop this slider all the way down to the left. Now I have this really nice gradient that I can manipulate over my image to give myself an area to add some text. It's not fighting with the background. I'm going to just duplicate that, and we're going to flip that around and I'm going to add a pink gradient on the bottom. We're just going to go back into the gradient and I'm going to change that color to this. We'll just grab this pink. Now I have a really nice canvas for adding my text on top of. We want our text to be readable. If it's not readable, people are just not going to read it and they're going to keep scrolling.

[00:22:06.530] - Kristin Rappaport
We'll add this. We got our nice big, chunky, readable text headline. I always encourage people to add the lovely call to action because if you don't tell your viewers what you want them to do, they probably won't do it. That's just the psychology behind marketing and design. Now I have my call to action down here in the bottom and with this pink gradient and just this really nice background that I have created My text is readable, my call to action, and my mockup stands out, and this just results in a really nice-looking graphic. I want to quickly show you guys how you can remove the photo of a background in just a few clicks. Let's say I have this blog post graphic. I want to add a photo of myself. I happen to have a folder in my brand folder that is all of my brand photos. I'm just going to click to add it. I take my brand photos in my bathroom just because the lighting is really good in there, but nobody wants to see me in the bathroom. Let's quickly remove the background. Right up above, you're going to see background remover.

[00:23:07.570] - Kristin Rappaport
All you need to do is click that. In just a few seconds, Canva works its magic. You can also click into it and let's say you had some fly away hairs or it maybe cut off your ear, you can erase parts that it didn't remove, and you can also restore parts, like maybe a missing ear or earring. Now I have my cut out of myself, and I'll just flip this to make it fit into this graphic. We'll put this on here, make that fit. Another technique I'll quickly show you, I love the look of this outline effect. If you select your image that's cut out, you can go into Edit, and we're going to go into Shadows, and we can add an outline here. I really like the look of white, but you could do any of your brand colors. This is a really good way to make you pop. Next up is adding some dimension with drop shadow. There's a couple of different ways that you can add dimension to your designs with drop shadows. You can add a drop shadow to text. We're going to select the text, go into effects and lift.

[00:24:05.200] - Kristin Rappaport
You've got this little slider down here, and I usually bump it up to 100. That really just adds a nice depth and dimension to your text all while making it pop and stand out. Canva's Element Library has tons of different shadows that you can add. I'm just going to type in shadow, and I want to make this phone pop just a little bit. I'm going to go into graphics. I am looking for this rectangle shadow. I'm going to twist We'll make this a little bit smaller so it just fits behind this phone. We're going to send it behind. Now all of a sudden, I've got this lovely dimension, and my phone almost looks like it's floating on the graphics. That is a really fun technique you can do. Another one that I'm using a lot is this shadow right here. I like to put this underneath a button. Just anything that you can do subtly to draw attention to important things in your design, like a button, is going to be amazing. You can also add shadows to an image. Let's say you're creating a quick mockup. You can go into Edit. We're going to go into Shadows.

[00:25:07.180] - Kristin Rappaport
Then I often just use this glow. You can change the intensity and the blur amount, the size and the color and all of that stuff. We'll just apply that style to that image, too. Now I've got this nice little mockup that's popping off of the background. It's becoming more of a focal point in your design. I also want to encourage you guys to try out some realistic elements. All of these elements I found in the Canva library, and there is no shortage of things that you can find. You can either do flower PNG. So PNG is the transparent background. So that's an option that's going to give you some different... Let me go into photos. Cut You have options of flowers and different things that you could use. And you can also type in whatever it is that you're looking for, go into the filters, and then cutouts only. These are going to show you everything that's a flower that doesn't have a background. And what can you do with these? Joanne and I have working on really jazzing up her graphics with these realistic elements. They're subtle, they just create that level of realness and connect with your audience in different ways, all while jazzing up your graphics and making you look just amazing.

[00:26:14.140] - Kristin Rappaport
She's got different, like a eucalyptus sleeve. We found ribbons, keys. There is no shortage of realistic elements in the Canva Element Library. Realistic elements are a really easy way to jazz up however you're displaying your digital products or mockups. And even if you want to build out highly detailed mockups of your memberships, your online programs, courses, whatever it is that you are creating, these realistic elements just icing on the cake. I love them, and it's something that I have been using a ton in my graphics. This is not a design technique. This is one of those things that I want to share with you because it definitely makes designing easier, and that is working with individual text boxes. And let me show you quickly what I mean by this. You've got a text box, you type in your text and you're like, Okay, this is boring as all. Heck, what am I going to do with this? How am I going to jazz this up? I'm going to recommend that you guys get into the habit of having your text in different text boxes. This way we can easily rotate things, we can switch out fonts quickly.

[00:27:16.230] - Kristin Rappaport
We can change the sizing of the fonts without affecting or fiddling around and struggling with the text all in one text boxes. We can change the fonts quickly. Let me go grab one of my other brand fonts. We can make things italic. We can adjust the size separately. And this gives you so much more design freedom. If you are working with text, try doing different text boxes to see what freedom that you have as you design.

[00:27:46.410] - Kristin Rappaport
