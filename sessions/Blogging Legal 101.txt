Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Hey, guys. Liz Stapleton here. I'm the host of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but this session is a little bit more tied to my background. We're gonna be talking about the seven things you need to know to legally protect your blog. And yes, I am an attorney, so I am a licensed attorney. I've been attorney since 2012, yes, eight years. I'm listed in New York and Massachusetts. I've spoken on the topic of blogging and the law at various other conferences.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:27]:
Fincon is an in person conference, some online summits, and I'm also a blogger. I've been a blogger since 2014, which makes me feel kind of like an old blogger. But anyway, I would like to just take a second to remind you to turn off your phone and close your tabs and get rid of any distractions so you can really focus on this session. And I also want to do a quick disclaimer that this is informational and educational purposes only. This isn't legal advice because I don't know your specific situation, so I can't give you legal advice. I'm not liable for anything you do or don't do based on the information I present in this session. So, just covering my backside. And here's what we're going to be covering today.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:13]:
First, we're going to talk about how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every kind of post. If you're a blogger, you kind of are aware of affiliate marketing. You may already have some idea of sort of what's required in disclosures, but we're going to dig a little bit deeper. All right? We're also going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what you should be including what GDPR is and why it matters, what CCPA is, which is the new privacy law on the block and why it matters. We're going to talk about the legal requirements of email marketing and list building, understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need one for your site. And then finally, we're going to talk about disclaimers to limit your liability and protect your blog. So, I know this could seem overwhelming. I just want to remind you that the legal stuff is important, but doesn't have to be scary or hard.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:02]:
And I'm realizing also that all the photos of me are when I had long hair. So I apologize. I swear it's still me. But let's go ahead and get started, okay? So, how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every kind of post. So, affiliate marketing, in case you're not aware, although I'm sure you are, is where you are getting paid to refer people to a product when they make a purchase. And FTC. The Federal Trade Commission has requirements on disclosures. Because the thing is, if you're getting paid, you might have some sort of bias.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:35]:
Ideally, we're all giving our honest opinions, but you still have to inform consumers that you are being paid. And language matters, as does where you put the disclosure and size. Okay? So when it comes to language, I know as bloggers we're like, oh yeah, this may contain affiliate links and we know what it means, but we don't realize that that's actually kind of a blogger jargon term. And not everyone knows what affiliate marketing is. And if you think back to before you got into blogging, you probably didn't necessarily know what that meant either. So you need to kind of make sure your disclosure is clear in terms of what you're saying. You also have to make sure your disclosure is above where they would click to click away on the affiliate link, because telling them after the fact when they've already left the page doesn't do them any good. So that's why oftentimes you'll see just at the top of every single blog post for some bloggers, it says, this may contain affiliate links, meaning I'll earn a commission if you click and make a purchase.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:36]:
And you can use the term affiliate marketing or affiliate link if you're explaining what it means, that's fine. So you can't make it like teeny tiny. It needs to be basically the same size as the rest of the text on the page. All right? Okay, so I've already kind of touched on this. You should be putting it above the content. Some mistakes I've seen people make is putting it in the sidebar or the footer. First of all, the footer is a bottom, so no go. But the problem with the sidebar is on a mobile screen, which a lot of users are using phones now, right? If you go to your Google Analytics, how much of your traffic is from mobile users versus desktop? On a mobile screen, the sidebar drops to the bottom of the page, which makes the disclosure after the content.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:21]:
So that's why you don't want to be putting your disclosures in the sidebar. You need to make sure it's above the fold or above the links within the content itself. All right? You also need to make sure you're disclosing social media and the same rules apply. So I see this a lot where especially like Twitter or something or even Instagram, although I see some great examples of how to do it right on Instagram, I think Instagram is really supported. That is, they'll do the post, they'll do the link and they'll do hashtags and they'll include a hashtag ad. The problem with that is that the disclosure is coming after the link and they may not see it. So you want to move that hashtag ad to the very beginning of your post, hashtag ad, copy link the rest of your hashtags, okay? Because you need to disclose it ahead of time. Again, hashtag ad is a much more understandable term than hashtag affiliate.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:12]:
So just keep in mind that language doesn't have to be super complicated. Just try to my kind of rule of thumb that I suggest is if your grandma want to understand it, then it's probably jargony. Okay? And the same thing goes for email marketing. I feel like this is an area that a lot of bloggers, even the ones I know are amazing bloggers and they're professional. They fail to do this. They will put the disclosure at the bottom of their email and it is not okay. Again, the disclosure must be before they can click on the link. So what I do in mine is I just make it the first thing before they even hide your name.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:49]:
I'm just like, hey, this email may contain affiliate links. Meaning if you click and make purchase, I'll get a commission at no cost to you. So just make that the first thing. Don't make it a PS, don't make it at the bottom. It needs to be before the link. If you have like a section where the links are, you could do it just before that section. It doesn't have to be before the entire email, but it must be before they can click to it. Okay? All right, so hopefully you kind of have a better understanding of sort of affiliate disclosures.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:17]:
Now we're going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what to include. Okay, so GDPR came into effect in 2018 and caused a huge splash. But the truth is there are various federal and state laws in the United States that it's like bits and pieces here and there that combined. Basically, say you need a privacy policy. And really the point is to just be open and transparent with the people on your site, okay? Just honest, open. Tell them what you're collecting, why? And chances are, even if you don't think you're collecting data, you are. Because if you allow comments on your site, if you have an email list that you're growing, you're collecting people's data, you're collecting their email address for the email sign up list. If you're using Google Analytics, you may be collecting anonymous data.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:07]:
So if you're using Pixels, Facebook Pixels, whatever, chances are you're collecting data whether you realize it or not. So you do need a privacy policy. Okay, like I said, pretty much everyone is collecting data. For example, various tools for Pixels, links to other sites. These are things that you need to include in your privacy policy. You need to tell them what you're collecting, whether it's personal or anonymous information, information about links to other sites. Because you're going to link to other sites whether they're affiliates or not. They may be affiliates.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:38]:
You need to explain that affiliate relationship. And cookies cookie policy is probably something that's why you always see the pop up banner of the site uses cookies. But also if you're just clicking to other sites, like, hey, I'm not responsible for what they're doing with your information or what information they collect. You need to go look at their privacy policy. You need to let them know when the page was last updated, what your overall cookie policy is and your contact information. Okay. Because people need a way to opt out. We'll get to kind of that in a minute, a way to opt out of that.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:13]:
So they need to be able to contact you. So that could be through a form, but ideally it's providing an email address, and that's because of CCPA, where the email address is, I think, specified. Okay, so hopefully this is making sense so far. I know I do speak quickly, but you can rewatch this. Step three. So let's talk about what GDPR is and why it matters. It stands for the Global Data Protection Regulation, and it's a law that came into effect in May 2018 out of the European Union. And you may think, well, I'm not in the EU.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:43]:
It doesn't apply to me. It's for people located in the EU. So if you're a travel blogger, you could be locating you or your ideal audience could be, or maybe you're a military blogger and there's people based in Europe or something that are in your audience. If you're marketing to people in Europe or in the European Union, then GDPR applies. Okay, we'll talk about CCPA next, because we're only going to see more and more laws like this. So it's easiest to just go ahead and get your site kind of up to snuff, make it compliant so that you're not having to stress every single time something comes out. Okay, like I said, jurisdiction includes sites that have an audience located in the EU. They don't have to be EU residents, they just have to be located there.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:30]:
Okay, like I said, more laws like it are coming. I want to let me talk about GDPR a little bit more. So GDPR came into effect because we had all those data breaches and we wouldn't find out until like years later, and that's kind of BS. And I'm sure you were pissed about it if you were one of those people that got your data breached. And so really what it requires is that you inform people what you're collecting and you get their consent to collect it. And people need to be able to opt out. And that's why things like cookie policies and those notifications are important. Okay, so you need to have consent.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:08]:
The big issue with GDPR is consent to collect information. And one of the biggest ways this hit bloggers was email marketing, because a lot of times the way it used to be is bloggers would offer a freebie in exchange for an email address, while the way the GDPR is written, you can't do that anymore. You can't condition something on requiring their information. So there's different ways to go about it. You can add a checkbox to your email marketing form that says, yes, I consent to receive marketing messages from so and so the way I like best. I read about it from Thrive Themes is to just kind of switch up the offer instead of being like, get your free this, enter your email address below. Instead, say subscribers get access to all these great things, including this sign up if you want it. So that way they're signing up to subscribe and that's just like a bonus that they're getting, okay, they can't sign up for the freebie and then to be added to a newsletter that they signed up for the freebie, not for a newsletter.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:16]:
That's not what they consented to. So it's got to be very specific. So hopefully that kind of makes sense. So CCPA so CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act, and it is similar in a lot of ways to GDPR. And chances are if you are complying with GDPR, you don't have to do that much more to comply with CCPA. So really it applies to people that have, I think, 50,000 sessions or users per month from California. So if you're a smaller blogger, it may not technically apply to you, but again, we're just going to see more and more laws like this. So I would just go ahead and take the actions necessary to apply.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:59]:
If you are existing solely online, like your blog is a fully online business, you don't have like a brick or mortar store or whatever, then you just need a way people contact you online with the email address. But one of the bigger differences with CCPA is that they have a rule about selling information, okay? So if you sell information, you have to have a way for people to opt out of that. And that's very explicit. And you need to have something in your privacy policy that is specifically for California residents that says these are your rights under CCPA, here's what you do to enact, but to take advantage of your right, whatever, I'm blanking on the word right now. So you will need that. And you may not think that you're going to sell information, and maybe you never have. If you sold information in the last twelve months, you need to update your privacy policy to say as much how you did that. And if you sold information last twelve months, there's actually quite a bit more you need to do within your privacy policy and things like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:02]:
If you've never sold information, and again, sold is this a new law? So does ads count as sold? In my reading of it, I didn't think so, but I've seen other people think so. So we're going to have to kind of wait and see how this plays out in the courts to see to what extent it's going to apply to bloggers. If like, ad revenue is considered selling personal information under CCPA, I'm not that worried about it at the moment. We'll see how this plays out. But one of the sessions, another session in the Summit is Chelsea Clark, who's awesome, and she talked about selling your blog so if that's something you're going to be doing down the road, you're going to need to kind of keep that in mind of you'll be selling information, so just keep that in mind. But yeah, so CCPA sort of applies to I really should line up my slides with my talking a little bit there really applies to people with a California based audience or at least have certain amount of people from California, and you can kind of figure that out in your Google Analytics. We have lots of sessions on analytics and diving in there. But yeah, like I said, requirements CCPA are very similar to GDPR in terms of getting consent, allowing people to opt out, allowing people to say, do not sell my information.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:17]:
Like, you can't include their information and it being sold. If you're selling information, there's a lot more you kind of need to dig in and understand. But hopefully that gives you an idea of CCPA and GDPR. Like I said, it's all about being open and transparent. Tell them what you're collecting, why you're collecting it, and sort of under GDPR, you need to explain what method of consent you're getting. Is it they're opting into the cookie? Is it they're checking a checkbox in your email list? Another form of consent is they're buying something like, you have to collect the information in order to deliver the product or service that they are paying for. That is considered consent. You're like, well, if you paid me for it, I have to give it to you, and I need that information to do it, so that counts.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:02]:
Okay. All right. Legal requirements of email marketing and list building. Okay, this can spam act. So in addition, GDPR out of the EU and CCPA out of California, where you're talking about all sorts of personal information, there's the Can Spam Act that's been around a lot longer. And this is the law that requires you to have an unsubscribe button at the bottom of your email as well as an address. And it cannot be a fake address. Guys, stop using fake addresses.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:27]:
Get a PO. Box. Or if you're with ConvertKit, I think they're the only ones I know of that do this. There might be some others, but they let you use their address. You're consenting to them opening any mail they get on your behalf, but you have to use a real address or you're going to be in trouble, basically. And this is also why you want to be using an email marketing service like ConvertKit or MailerLite or ActiveCampaign. I mean, there's a ton out there. Drip, AWeber, goes on and on.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:59]:
But it's because they make it not only because you can't send 1000 emails on a Gmail account one day, but also because they make it easy to sort of implement those things. You need to be Can Spam compliant that allows people to unsubscribe from your list. Okay, like I said, what to use for your address. It needs to be real. It can be a PO box. Peel boxes are pretty affordable. It varies very much by location, so it might be the one closest to you is expensive, and the one across town is not. But as long as you're willing to go across town once a month to check it, go with a cheaper one, it's fine.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:38]:
But again, must be a real address. Like I said, you can always use your house address, but if you're not comfortable with that, then PO. Box or ConvertKit I believe lets you use theirs. All right. List building GDPR. Okay, so I've already touched on this a bit. Do you really need checkboxes? Potentially. So it kind of depends on how you're framing your offer.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:59]:
I also do want to note that double opt in doesn't necessarily mean consent under GDPR. And the reason I say that is because I do use ConvertKit, and I'm familiar with the platform. I've used them for years, and I love them in a lot of ways, but they have this thing which was awesome before GDPR. But I think many people could get confused about is they have the double opt in, where when they click on the download button, it double opts them, and it confirms them, and so they're clicking to get the freebie. That's not necessarily consent under GDPR. Okay. So if you're like, oh, I've always done double opt in. You need to really think about, okay, what that double opt in looks like, and if it really constitutes the consent that you're perceiving them giving.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:45]:
Okay. But pretty much every email marketing service has a great GDPR compliant type of thing. So ConvertKit lets you do, like, a squeeze page, which is what I use, and you can even say just do it from traffic, from the EU, where after they opt into your form, they're taken to a page. If they're from the EU, it's like, hey, are you cool opting into the email list? It's like yes or no. If no, then you don't email them, but they still get the freebie or whatever. If yes, then you've got that marked consent. And pretty much every email marketing service has something of that sort to help you comply with GDPR. So whatever email marketing service you're using I said I use ConverKit.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:
And actually, they're doing a session here, and they've got a great offer. But whatever you're using, be sure and look into what they have in place to help you comply with GDPR. Okay? All right. Understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need them for your site. Because we've talked about privacy policies, terms and conditions are actually a bit different. So basically, terms and conditions are saying, your site, your rules. Okay. It's like, my house, my rules.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:53]:
Okay. You're not allowed to do this or this or this. I don't have to accept your comments. Even if you buy my products. If you are using them commercial or trying to resell them, then that's not allowed. So they're just setting your house rules and letting people know what they are. In a lot of cases, if you're just blogging, you may not need them, but if you're running a community of some sort or you're selling products, you probably do need some terms and conditions that you're selling them on term that whatever product they're purchasing is for personal use only, things like that. So terms and conditions can also be where you keep your refund policy.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:
Again, if you're selling products or services. So if you're selling things besides like affiliate marketing or ad revenue, if you're selling products, services, things of that nature, chances are you do want some sort of terms and conditions on your site. They can also help to limit your liability of what you're responsible for and what you're not. You can put in your Disclaimers and disclosures, include those in there and just kind of cover your business to protect your business, to make sure people aren't thinking you're an expert in something if you're not and you're just giving your opinion. Kind of like how I put my Disclaimer of, yes, I'm an attorney, but I don't know what's going on with you. So this isn't legal advice. This is informational purposes only. All right? They also terms and conditions allow you to decide where you're going to throw down.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:25]:
So if there's some sort of issue, you need to go to court. You can say in your terms and conditions where that needs to happen. Because if you're located in North Carolina, you probably don't want to go to court in Massachusetts, right? So you can kind of lay down the law of what jurisdiction is going to apply if someone's going to take issue with you and or if you need to take issue, really if someone takes issue with you. Okay. All right, so let's dive a little more into Disclaimers to limit your liability and protect your blog. So there's professional non professional disclaimers, and by professional, I mean like the attorney one. I just did like three times. I'm an attorney.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:02]:
But this isn't legal advice. It's informational educational purposes only. But then there's non professional disclaimers, because my first blog ever again has been slightly neglected lately. I'm going to get back to it, but it's called Less Debt, More Wine and it's on personal finance. But I am not a financial expert. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a financial advisor. And so I have to say that I say that, I say it's like, hey, guys, these are my thoughts, my opinions.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:24]:
I am not in any way licensed in finance. So just so you know, this isn't from a licensed professional in this area. So you could also, if you're like, a nurse or something yes, I'm a nurse, but this is not medical advice. You need to talk to an actual doctor or nurse or whatever you can kind of same idea. Nutrition is an area that comes a lot, fitness, things like that. I think areas I'm thinking of that you might need to include either a professional or non professional disclaimer. Okay. Earnings and testimonial disclaimers, these get overlooked a lot.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:01]:
So one of the best ways to sell a product is to get other people to sell it for you by the way of giving a testimonial, giving feedback and telling people how awesome it is. But you need to have or saying they made X amount of dollars after implementing your system. Right? Those are great things to have, but you need to have earnings and testimonial disclaimers. And really what that does is you're saying, hey, these are all real students. But B, your results are going to depend on the work you put in and I can't guarantee that you're going to reach the same level of success. Like I can't guarantee any sort of level of success for you. There's a lot of factors that go into this. So it's kind of basically spelling that out.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:46]:
All right, and then again bringing it back to where we started. Affiliate sponsored content, you need to make sure that you are disclosing affiliate links but also sponsored content, okay? It's the same idea. It needs to be above. Sponsored content actually needs to be before the content starts. It shouldn't be mixed in somewhere. Affiliate disclosure just needs to be before a link. But sponsored content, you need to disclose. Hey, this blog post is sponsored by so and so, all opinions of my own, whatever.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:
We actually have a whole session on sponsored, on doing sponsored content with Tracy Fobes you should absolutely check out and we talk more about the disclosure there. But just make sure anything that you're getting paid for, you're being open, honest, and transparent about it. That's really kind of what matters. So recapping what you learned. You learned to properly disclose relationships, whether they're affiliate sponsors or otherwise. You learned why GDP matters and GPR matters and how CCPA relates. And that we're just going to see more laws like this coming down the pipeline. So you may as well jump on the bandwagon and get your site compliant.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:51]:
And you saw that disclaimers and disclosures are just as important as everything else you do with your blog. Okay? So take action. Protect your blogging business. Hopefully you've maybe had your mind a little easier, feeling a little more prepared to understand this. It's always the best policy to go to an attorney. Jamie, Hashtag Legal, who's also speaking at the session is great. So Sam Mazzeo, who's a lawyer speaking at the session, it's a personalized privacy policy and everything is always going to be the best solution. Okay? But I recognize that not everyone can afford that.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:28]:
Once you get blog starts earning the money that you can still go do that, but sort of the next best step is to get templates from an attorney, and I do have those. I have a Website Legal Templates Bundle that includes Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Disclosures disclaimers, and I am offering a $47 discount to all attendees. And that's in the perks section. You guys can go check that out. It makes it $100, which is actually a really good deal. But yeah, they're templates. Keep in mind they are templates, right? They're not personalized. It's kind of like when you get swipe copy for an affiliate launch.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:58]:
There may be things in there that don't apply to your audience or don't quite fit for what you're doing. So it's a general template. It's better than a lot of the free alternatives out there or trying to copy from someone who didn't go to an attorney or whatever, I don't know. But templates from attorney are going to be better. But going to an attorney yourself and gain that person is always going to be best. So just keep that in mind and I hope that helps. And I'll see you guys in the rest of the summit.
