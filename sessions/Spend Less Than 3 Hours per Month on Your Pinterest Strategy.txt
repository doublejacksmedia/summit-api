 Welcome to this presentation all about how to spend less than 3 hours per month on your Pinterest strategy for your blog. Yes, you heard that right. I'm going to be teaching you all about Pinterest marketing, but I'm going to teach you the easy way. No strategies that take hours and hours. I'm going to teach you how to get from point A to point B as quicquicklyquicquicklyklyPintokly as possible when it comes to Pinterest.

[00:00:36.780] - Speaker 1
SoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoS are we ready? Let's get started. First of all, you might be like, who is this chick teaching you about Pinterest? Well, my name is Anita, and I have been a blogger for ten-plus years now. I have two travel blogs and I'm originally from New Zealand, but I currently live in a very small country called Albania, which is right next to Greece.

[00:00:57.120] - Speaker 1
It's very beautiful, by the way, as well as travel blogging. I also coach bloggers and online business owners on how to use blogs and Pinterest account to grow their business or their blog. I love Pinterest. I am so obsessed with it, and I'm really excited to teach you all about it. So how do you feel about Pinterest at the moment?

[00:01:23.780] - Speaker 1
I want your honest thoughts. Okay. How do you really feel about the platform? Do you feel excited to use Pinterest? Do you feel really happy about the platform?

[00:01:34.210] - Speaker 1
Do you love Pinterest? Do you love Pinterest? Are you confused? Are you overwhelmed? Are you fed up?

[00:01:41.220] - Speaker 1
I want you to be really honest with me. I want you to pop in the chat. How do you feel about Centrist currently? And the reason why I want you to do this is I want you to get it all out. Okay.

[00:01:53.080] - Speaker 1
I want you to tell me how you feel about this platform because I want all the negative talk, all the negative interest things that you may have heard in the Facebook groups. I've seen them. I'm part of the blogging Facebook group. I know what kind of goes around, but I want to leave all of that negativity right now. Okay.

[00:02:12.650] - Speaker 1
I want you to leave it at the door. Forget any negative comments and complaints you've heard about the platform. Maybe you've seen comments like Pinterest doesn't work for bloggers anymore. That is complete. B.

[00:02:23.840] - Speaker 1
Yes. By the way, I want this to be a fresh start and a new opportunity for you to get in front of your ideal audience. Pinterest is an incredible and very powerful platform that bloggers like me still use every day and see fantastic results. So leave all the negative Pinterest talk at the store and let's get into this presentation. So here's what you're going to learn today.

[00:02:49.840] - Speaker 1
I am all about taking action, by the way. Okay, so make sure that you have your notebook and you have your Pin to take lots of notes because I have so much that I want to share with you today and I think you're really going to love what I'm going to be teaching you. So the first thing we're going to go through is the two important steps to do before you put your Pinterest marketing strategy into place. Okay. There are two very important steps that you need to do.

[00:03:15.670] - Speaker 1
And if you do not do these, you're going to be wasting time creating content, putting it out there,

[00:03:20.470] 
and seeing no traction. Okay. The second thing that you're going to be learning is my secret to spending less than 3 hours per month on Pinterest. It is totally entirely possible if you know how to do it, right. And the third thing that I'm going to be teaching you is how to automate so that you can spend more time on other areas of your blogging business.

[00:03:43.640] - Speaker 1
We know, as bloggers, we have, like, a thousand things that we need to do, right? We have so many different hats that we are wearing, and I'm going to teach you a little bit about automation and how it can actually really help your blogging business. Are you ready? I want you to pop in the live chat if you are ready for this presentation. If you're ready to learn about Pinterest and learn about this strategy so that you can spend less time on Pinterest and have that running in the background while you do all of the other amazing things that your floor brings in.

[00:04:15.300] - Speaker 1
Are we ready? Yes. Okay. So the first thing that I want you to take note of in order to see results on Pinterest, you need a combination of two things. So the first thing is SEO.

[00:04:29.000] - Speaker 1
Now, SEO stands for search engine optimization. If you don't know, the SEO actually gets your pens out in front of your ideal Pin is in the first place. So it is really important. And then the second part of this is your pins need to inspire the Pinner to take action. So the actual look of your pins, the call to action.

[00:04:50.660] - Speaker 1
They need to inspire the Pinner to take action, to read your blog post, to download your freebie, right. It needs to inspire. And we're going to be delving in a little bit about SEO because it is really important. But why is it important? Because Pinterest is a visual search engine?

[00:05:09.150] - Speaker 1
It's not a social media platform. Okay. When you go to Pinterest, you're not scrolling as you do on social media. You're not connecting with people. You're not being social like on social media.

[00:05:20.620] - Speaker 1
Pinterest is a search engine. Okay. And Pinterest is there to inspire and give ideas to Pinnace. So this could be like, what's the next DIY project that they need to do? Right?

[00:05:32.380] - Speaker 1
What to Cook for dinner? Inspire them with recipes that they should be cooking for dinner. What to wear this summer? Where to travel to next year? How to organize their lives.

[00:05:43.600] - Speaker 1
Right. And Pinners are not typing into Pinterest specific questions like you would on Google. So it is really important to know the user intent of the platform before you put out your strategy. So when you're thinking about Google and Pinterest, they are both search engines, but they do work a little bit differently, and the user intent is different. Okay.

[00:06:05.490] - Speaker 1
We don't go into Pinterest typing in how do I get from here to here or how do I do this without blah, blah blah. Usually Pinterest, we're typing in no less words, maybe like dinner recipes or summer dinner recipes. And we're looking for inspiration from there. So there are two important steps you need to do before getting into your marketing strategy, and those are set up and SEO. Okay, so before we get creating content, or if you are already on Pinterest and you're creating content, just pause for a second and make sure that you have all of this done first.

[00:06:44.020] - Speaker 1
Okay. So the setup part of it is you need to have your website claim, make sure that you do that. It's pretty easy and takes around five to ten minutes. You can go into settings and you'll go and add your website and you'll have to add a little code and it's really easy to do. And it just gives you pretty clear instructions on how to do that.

[00:07:02.370] - Speaker 1
The second thing you need to make sure is that you have a business account. So if you do have a personal business account, a personal visit. If you have a personal Pinterest account, you need to convert that and you can do that in the settings. If you haven't signed up for Pinterest yet, then you can create a business account from the get-go. And once we have that, we get access to some incredible analytics.

[00:07:23.970] - Speaker 1
Okay. And then the second part of this is search engine optimization. So before we get into posting content, you need to make sure that your profile is optimized. Yes, you can optimize your profile, not just your pen. So you need to make sure that in the name of your Pinterest profile, you have your blog, and you also have one to two keywords for your niche and your title.

[00:07:50.530] - Speaker 1
The second part of this is your profile description. This should be really clear on who you help and what you help them with and make sure that you include some keywords in there, too. And this is going to help your profile to be more visible. And then the third part of this is making sure that you have relevant boards set up. So I would recommend if you're just getting started a minimum of eight to ten boards on your Pinterest account.

[00:08:16.650] - Speaker 1
If you are already on Pinterest and you have been for a while and you have more boards, then that's great. But make sure that they are relevant. And the title of the boards is search terms that your ideal Pin is typing into Pinterest. Okay. And then another step to that is making sure that all your boards have descriptions I promise you.

[00:08:40.030] - Speaker 1
So those are the two steps that you need to make sure that you have done before you go creating content and publishing it set up and SEO. So I want you to take action on this. Your action step is to set up and optimize your own profile. So take some time to do this one-off task and get it done. All right.

[00:09:02.340] - Speaker 1
This is not a task that you have to do every week you don't want and you have it done. Okay. So I want you to pop in the chat. I want you to pop. Yes.

[00:09:11.040] - Speaker 1
If you can commit to doing this within the next week or two and put the time in your calendar to do this because this is really important. All right, so let's get onto how the secret on how I spend less than 3 hours per month on Pinterest. So there are three kinds of pointers that I want to talk about. The first is batching. So I'm going to go deeper into this in a second.

[00:09:36.800] - Speaker 1
But batching is when you allocate time periods where you do one task only. Okay. And when you get into a rhythm of doing that one task, you actually get it done ten times faster. Now, the second point that I want to say is done over perfect. All right, so stop obsessing that your pin has to be perfect.

[00:09:57.920] - Speaker 1
Get it done. All right, set a timer for yourself. I love to put a time on for five or ten minutes, and after that, I have to have my pen down any more time than that, I'm obsessing over the details. That probably doesn't even matter. Okay, so just get it done over perfect.

[00:10:14.350] - Speaker 1
And then the third thing is to make sure that you have some systems in place. So this could be like templates. This could be repurposing your Pin description and knowing what content does best for your account. So you're not wondering what kind of content should I put out. You should already know that.

[00:10:31.470] - Speaker 1
Okay. And there's no need to reinvent the wheel, do more of what's working. So lean into what content is doing really well on Pinterest for your niche. Okay. And just a side note, I'm going to be giving you some templates at the end, so stick around.

[00:10:47.770] - Speaker 1
Let's talk a little bit more about batching. So with batching, before you set up your batching schedule, you need to write out all of the tasks that you do. Okay. So with Pinterest, there are maybe around six tasks that I've put down here. So we have research.

[00:11:02.880] - Speaker 1
We have the creation of the pins, the creation of the Pin title, and descriptions. We have scheduling or publishing. We have tracking, and we have account updates. So those are all the kinds of tasks that we do when it comes to Pinterest. Now, I want you to split those tasks up.

[00:11:19.600] - Speaker 1
There are two kinds of tasks in there. There are the creation tasks, which actually, you need a lot of focus for. Okay. We cannot be creating maybe titles or descriptions and things like that with Netflix in the background. Okay.

[00:11:35.120] - Speaker 1
But admin tasks don't need our 100% focus. We can kind of do this, like in the background, the creation. You do need a lot of motivation and downtime to be in that creation phase. So split those tasks up. And maybe you decide that all the creative tasks for Pinterest, you'll do every second Monday, and maybe the admin tasks you'll do once a month on the last day of the month or something like that.

[00:12:02.390] - Speaker 1
Okay. And you can kind of split your time up there. So you can say I'm going to spend only 1 hour on admin tasks, and then creation tasks usually take a little bit of more time. So I'm going to spend 2 hours per month. And maybe you'll split those 2 hours, like 1 hour every two weeks you'll do for creation parts or whatever that looks like for you.

[00:12:23.000] - Speaker 1
You can split it up that way. So I want you to take action on this. I want you to commit to putting in the time in your calendar for Pinterest, and you can create a batch and schedule for yourself. You can see an example here of one of my clients, her monthly schedule. So week one, the first week of the month, she would do just creation tasks.

[00:12:47.260] - Speaker 1
So she would be creating pins and things like that. And she put 45 minutes. And then week two, she was doing admin tasks. She put 1 hour for that. And then week three was creation again.

[00:12:59.040] - Speaker 1
So you can split up your time similar to this. But I want you to commit to doing this. Okay. It's all well and good me teaching you about batching, but if you don't put it into practice, you're not going to do it. Okay.

[00:13:11.090] - Speaker 1
So copy. Yes. In the chat. If you can commit to me today that you will put this time into Pinterest. Okay.

[00:13:19.690] - Speaker 1
All right. So the third step that I want to talk about is automation. Automation is incredible. So your time is better than elsewhere for certain tasks. Okay.

[00:13:34.200] - Speaker 1
Automate the tasks that you don't have to do. There are computers for that. There are automations for that so that you can spend more time focusing on other tasks that push your blog forward. All right. So as a Pinterest coach, I would recommend that for my clients to post ten, two to five times per day.

[00:13:56.260] - Speaker 1
So I want you to be really real with me in the chat right now. Can you show up on Pinterest that many times a day to live, publish every single day consistently, and not get burnt out? This is where I see a lot of bloggers go wrong is that you're getting burnt out with Pinterest. And the thing with Pinterest is that you need to take, you know, it can take at least three months to see results. So why not automate a part of Pinterest that can actually save you time so that you can show up consistently.

[00:14:33.910] - Speaker 1
So my recommendation is to use an approved scheduler. This is one way that we can automate our Pinterest marketing strategy. So Pinterest is not trying to make things harder for you. My recommendation for a schedule is Tailwind. I have used Kwan for years and years and years now and I do have a $30 credit in case you want to try it out and see how you like it.

[00:14:56.290] - Speaker 1
But there is another bunch of schedulers out there that are approved with central as well. If you don't like tailwind or if you try that and you're not working on it, there is Canva you can schedule pins for Canva later plan a loyal, and then also Pinterest has a scheduler for themselves. It is very basic, so I don't necessarily recommend it, but if you do want something basic to help you out and is free, then you can try the Pinterest one. Okay. I just recommend Tailwind because I personally use it, and there are some other features within Tailwind like you can go deeper into analytics into your boards and things like that, and it's a really easy way to schedule content.

[00:15:39.950] - Speaker 1
So that would be my recommendation. The reason why it's really important to automate is that you need to be consistent with Pinterest. It is a platform where you do need to show up every day consistently to see results. It's not a platform where you can put out five pins and then forget for a couple of weeks and then post another ten pins and then wonder why it's not working out. It's because you're not being consistent.

[00:16:08.870] - Speaker 1
So Pinterest is not a quick fix because it's not a social media platform, right? We don't put out content and we get results straight away as we might with social media. With Pinterest, you need to be patient. And the return on investment with Pinterest is much, much higher than social media because when we put out a Pin, it's circulating for years and years and years. Okay, so that Pin might not gain traction for a few months or a year.

[00:16:37.810] - Speaker 1
Even I have a Pin, which I posted in 2015, which still brings me traffic to this day. So when you are implementing Pinterest for your blog, you need to be patient. Please, please be patient. Okay. And it's really important to test and analyze with Pinterest as well.

[00:16:59.780] - Speaker 1
You don't know what's doing well unless you're tracking and analyzing. So once you have done your setup, you've done your SEO and you're putting out content. Then I want you to lean in and what's working. Tip and analyze. Analyze the content that you put out and see what is doing really well for your Pinterest account for your topics, your niche.

[00:17:22.100] - Speaker 1
So once you've been on Pinterest and you have been posting for three months consistently every day two to five times per day. Then look at your top five to ten pens and answer these questions. What do these pins look like? And are there any consistencies in your pens that look very similar? Do your top pins look very similar in the way that they've laid out all the pictures, the types of pictures, the colors?

[00:17:49.850] - Speaker 1
What keywords are you using for those pins? Are they regular pins or video pins? So for me, my Pinterest account, video pins do much better than standard pens because they catch the eye more of the pen up. And then also, what's the topic of the pen? So you may find that certain topics do much better than others.

[00:18:09.640] - Speaker 1
For example, when I was analyzing my account, I found out that my London content does incredibly well. So from there, I put out more London content because that's what's working. Do more of what's working. Okay, so your third and final action step is to start scheduling pins. Okay, try out a scheduler and get familiar with it.

[00:18:36.320] - Speaker 1
Remember, there is Tailwind, Canva, Planoly, there's Later or you can try out Pinterest itself. Okay. It will honestly make your Pinterest marketing strategy 1000 times easier. And it'll make your blog more scalable because you'll be able to spend more time doing other things in your blogging business, like pitching to brands or writing articles, doing that sort of thing. Leave Pinterest to do its thing in the background.

[00:19:04.690] - Speaker 1
That's what it's good for. Okay, so let's go through these three action sets that I have given you today. Make sure you write this down and make sure that you do that. Okay. Because again, I can teach you all of the strategies in the world, but the only thing that is actually going to help you and get you success on Pinterest is taking action.

[00:19:25.870] - Speaker 1
So the first action step is to set up and optimize your profile. Okay. The second step is to create a batch and workflow that works for you and make the commitment to stick to it. So put it in your calendar, make sure that you do stick to it. And then the third thing is to start to use a scheduler, right?

[00:19:48.600] - Speaker 1
Experiment. See how you like it. Check out a different scheduler, make sure that you use a tool like a scheduler to help you stay consistent with Pinterest. And I know consistency. Such a hard word to say is not something that is like, overly sexy or anything like that.

[00:20:11.420] - Speaker 1
But it is so, so important with Pinterest, with any type of platform, with social media, with your blog. Consistency is so important and uses automation to help you with that. Okay. All right. So if you have a Pinterest question, I want you to pop in the chat right now if you have a question about Pinterest, if you have a question about anything that I have talked about in this presentation, I want you to leave it in the chat because I am in there right now answering your questions.

[00:20:44.370] - Speaker 1
Okay. And I know with Pinterest, there is a lot of different questions that you may have. Pinterest is a changing platform. It changes so much these days. We have so many new updates as well.

[00:20:57.280] - Speaker 1
So maybe you have some questions that you are dying to know, and I want you to go ask them because this is what I'm here for. I'm here to answer your questions in the chat. Okay. And I have a special gift for you today. So to save time and how to get started with Pinterest, I have created a free Pinterest blogger bundle that you are welcome to go get right now.

[00:21:23.570] - Speaker 1
So within this bundle, you get my six-step roadmap to get your blog on Pinterest. So if you're at the very beginning stage, then this roadmap is really going to help you, even if you are not on the beginner stage. If you're not sure if you have everything set up correctly, then this roadmap is going to make sure that you have everything done and dusted before you go and create content. Okay. So it's a really helpful step-by-step roadmap to help you get started on Pinterest and get that set up and SEO is done.

[00:21:56.750] - Speaker 1
And then the second thing you get within this bundle is my five free Pinterest templates. Again, I want to show you that Pinterest doesn't have to take a lot of time. Use these Pinterest templates and create content faster. And then the third thing is my Pin description formula that allows you to create them quickly. So Pin descriptions can sometimes be kind of a scary thing because we think alike, we need to write these things and they can belong and they can take time.

[00:22:27.720] - Speaker 1
I'm going to show you my three-step formula to actually create those faster. They don't have to be that difficult. Okay. And I'm going to show you how to create them so that they actually convert Pinners to your blog post or to your email list. Whatever you're using Pinterest for, I show you how to create those optimized pen descriptions for your pen, and then a little bonus as well.

[00:22:51.690] - Speaker 1
I have tracked in $30 Tailwind credit. So if you did want to try out a scheduler, but you're not sure if Tailwind is the right one, then use the credit. Try it out. If you like it, continue. If you don't, then use another one.

[00:23:05.420] - Speaker 1
Okay. But it's there for you to have. So if you want to get this Blogger bundle, then all you have to do is you have to click the button below to get that you'll be sent to a signup page. You just have to put your name and your email, and then I will send it out to your email and you'll get that Blogger bundle within minutes. Okay.

[00:23:27.360] - Speaker 1
And this blogger bundle is there for you to save time on Pinterest, and it's going to be really really helpful for your Pinterest marketing strategy. So I'm so thankful that you have joined me for this presentation today. I hope that you have learned something. Remember, if you have any questions to pop it in the live chat because I'm here right now answering your questions, I hope you have enjoyed it. And I will speak to you soon.
