[00:00:13.370] - Liz
Hey, everybody, and welcome. My name is Liz Theresa, and I am here to teach you guys all about how you can use copy to increase your conversions. Because let's face it, money comes from your message. And if you're watching this presentation, you have a blog or you have a business and who wouldn't want that to be more profitable? That's what we're here to do.

[00:00:35.940] - Liz
So, a little bit more about me personally, I'm the host of Liz on Biz. So, if you've listened to my show, it's delivered fresh every single Monday, 30 minutes of inspirational and funny content about business stuff and marketing and all that. I've been in business ten years this year building websites and brands for people. I'm a professional branding and business coach, and I'm a Mama, and that's my peanut named Leo. And yeah, and I'm from the Boston area.

[00:01:04.490] - Liz
Just so you guys get a little bit of context for where I'm coming from. So, here's what we're going to be talking about today and throughout content. I try to keep things light and cheaper, because sometimes when we talk about messaging, it's sort of like your brain will feel like it weighs Â£100. So, you'll notice fun gifts and little animations. I'll just try to keep it super light for you, because when I say, what's your message, you're probably thinking.

[00:01:30.910] - Liz
I don't know. That's a really normal reaction. So, please be gentle with yourself as they take you through some of this content. And if you've already learned a lot about messaging. So, if you're like a veteran of this stuff, what I would suggest to you is just try to keep an open mind because you might learn something new because I think that the way I teach it is a little bit different than what you might be used to, which is ideal.

[00:01:53.520] - Liz
Right? Because then I'm different and that's good. So, I'm going to start by talking about what's copy, message and conversions, which are like the kind of the key points in this presentation, and then we're going to work on your message together. Okay. Let's go.

[00:02:07.830] - Liz
So, what is copy really, right? So, copy is any words, messaging or content you use with relation to your brand. And by the way, you guys all have brands, even if you've never described your blog or your website as a brand or your business as a brand, you're a brand. Personally, you're a brand. We're all brands, whether or not we choose to like accept it.

[00:02:31.310] - Liz
So, once you start to accept it, you can be more strategic with your brand, right? Because copy and messaging and content, these are things that we can tweak and use as a tool to get people to take the actions we want. And you can see I get a little silly. There's any content you use and emails autologue with a dog, with a hem, just to keep you.

[00:02:58.400] - Liz
So, I want to keep on your toes, guys. Okay. Copy is the basis of your marketing and you're like, okay, Liz, you say that probably because you sell copy, and I'm like, yeah, that's true. But like, look at this.

[00:03:11.500] - Liz
Look at this. This is irrefutable scientific evidence that it really does scientific evidence. You guys are probably like, she's crazy. But listen, copy is the central thing when it comes to your website, Facebook Ads sales page. Copy.

[00:03:26.550] - Liz
Everything hinges on copy. And what you might have noticed in your work thus far is that for blogs and blogging, that couldn't be more true. So, when I'm going to be talking about messaging, this is a different type of copy that maybe you're used to writing, but it's probably the most important when it comes to thinking of using your blog and your website as a lead converter and as something that you want to use to funnel people to like buy something later or even just to grow your readership.

[00:03:57.030] - Liz
Depending on what your goal is, copy is going to be this powerful thing you can use.

[00:04:02.390] - Liz
So, it's at your disposal. And I always like to say, yes, even you can use copy because everybody has this inner voice. It's like, but not me. Like I'm just me over here that sounds hard or like, I should just hire a professional copywriter and you can. Professional copywriters are cool rad people, and they're great if you end up slamming your head against the wall too much about this.

[00:04:28.740] - Liz
The goal of this presentation is to make this something that you can do yourself. So, we talked about copy. Here's what I'm talking about when I say conversions. Okay. So, when we're talking about using copy to increase conversion, when people say conversion, they mean that you convert that word a higher percentage of users from your website than you would otherwise. So, when you think of your website, it's getting a ton of traffic.

[00:04:57.050] - Liz
And if you even think of the highway, right, that's all users on the internet, if you can think of it like a highway, and maybe your exit number 15. Okay, that's your website as exit 15. And you want people to come to that exit, right. And you want to capture all that traffic and retain it. There are ways to do that.

[00:05:17.060] - Liz
And the way that you do it online is with your language. It's with words. Okay. I guess if it were a real exit sign, you can make yours purple and have glowing lights and say that there's free tacos. And that might work.

[00:05:29.830] - Liz
But for the purposes of your blog, then you use words. Words are at your disposal to increase conversions, because even as a blog, you're going to be traffic is a wicked big deal. And what's really frustrating, and this is a person that's been doing this for ten years is that I think when I say you guys are so concerned about traffic, you guys look for ways to increase traffic, but you don't focus on retention. And that's your problem because it's easy to just throw money at SEO and Google ads and Pinterest ads or wherever you're throwing your money and you will see an uptick in traffic.

[00:06:07.370] - Liz
But if they're not subscribing opting in or engaging with you or following you everywhere, then you're really just wasting it.

[00:06:15.660] - Liz
Because who cares? Like, if they're coming once. You want to create people that are coming to you all the time, you want loyal readers that become like unofficial brand ambassadors. That's totally the goal. Okay. So, conversions matter kind of no matter where you're coming from.

[00:06:33.750] - Liz
And if you focus on your messaging and your copy, then you can spend money on the SEO and all that other stuff. Because by improving your copy on your website, that's going to let readers and users know how you fit into their world. Because if somebody comes to your website, gets a recipe and leaves, they might not know why they should say for more recipes. Or maybe why your website is better for that type of content than delicious or something. So, like I want you to think a little bit about that.

[00:07:03.890] - Liz
Like, why are you better? And that's going to come up when we talk about messaging, but how to make that extremely amplified? There's no mistake for how you fit into somebody's world because that's sort of what people are like, is this worth my time? Is this worth my time is a reframe that goes through somebody's mind when they're a user. That's like going through content on website after website.

[00:07:23.960] - Liz
Okay. And so, then when your website is better and optimized for converting people, like I said, your marketing dollars get you more readers and customers. So, rather than spending $10 on a Google ad to get 30 people that won't come back, you could spend $10 on a Google ad to get 30 people that do come back. Does that make sense? Alright.

[00:07:43.060] - Liz
So, once you accept, now you're like, okay, Liz, I'm starting to believe you. This is what you're thinking. You're like, I'm starting to believe you might be onto something. Okay. And I'm like, yeah, why do you think I'm here?

[00:07:56.310] - Liz
I would say here's what I mean about messaging. So, we talked about how copies all the words and all the content that shows up in your business. Like, you remember that chart where I was like, there's scientific. This is scientific proof. Big bang theory proof, right?

[00:08:11.510] - Liz
That copies wicked important. Well, there's different types of copy. There's a copy that you guys are probably more used to, like, social media posts and newsletters and blog articles. Right. And then there is your messaging.

[00:08:25.360] - Liz
And your messaging is definitely the thing on which everything hinges. And if you think about your brand like a house, your messaging is definitely the concrete foundation that is holding everything up. The really strong and sturdy stuff. And your messaging has four parts. Okay.

[00:08:42.570] - Liz
And it's who you help. What you help people do. The problem you solve and how you solve it, and why you do it. And so maybe you're like, well, is that five or that's six? And you just made it look like four. And I'd be like, maybe.

[00:08:58.090] - Liz
But let's look at it like, it's four things because it may feel a little bit easier. And when the message is the thing that's really strong client attraction or readership or whatever your goal is, that is going to work so much better. Okay. So, when I say, who is your target audience? I am talking about your ideal reader. Who is the world?

[00:09:22.570] - Liz
What kind of person's life do you want to change like when you think about raising the stakes on what you're doing here? And it's sort of like going from talking about your website, like being like, oh, yeah, I have a website. No, I have a brand. I have a company I'm running. Like I want you to start using grown up language when talking about yourself, because that will raise the stakes and remind you why the work is so important.

[00:09:47.380] - Liz
Okay. So, messaging is really about digging deep and just scratching the surface to get clear on, like, why is this work so important? Which is why the why, you see the why at the bottom. But sometimes it's actually easier to start the why? Because you're like, okay, well, why did I start this?

[00:10:05.840] - Liz
What difference do I want to make in the world? And when you start saying, what difference do you want to make that can also help you get clear on the who right. So, you might be like, well, I started this because I was really tired of dieting, and I wanted to produce body positive content that made me feel less alone in my own skin. Okay. And then you're like, well, then who do you help?

[00:10:25.580] - Liz
People that are looking into body positive content, people that are body positive activists, people that are interested in that kind of stuff. So, like then you can see how you can work backwards. And then the problem that you solve in the case of body confidence, it would be I solve the problem of like society hating fat people or, like, you know body dysmorphia and you know like help people with disordered eating feel less alone. How do you solve it through the content? The empowering content through interviews, through my podcast, through my blog.

[00:11:02.290] - Liz
Some of you guys might have courses through courses. So, you could kind of, that's what you sell, right. So, what you sell, even if you don't sell anything you're serving. So, you're giving content. So that's definitely the how you solve it.

[00:11:15.360] - Liz
So, that's just an example of messaging. I told you, I'd make you feel alive with the funny gifs, guys. This is really me. That's me with brunette hair, though. But what I'm getting at is that your messaging, right?

[00:11:31.200] - Liz
You've probably heard of brand message statements. So, this is also sometimes called a mission statement, even though that's technically a little bit different although if it helps you to think of it that way, go with it. Your elevator pitch.

[00:11:43.850] - Liz
That's the horrible thing where you stand in a room and you have to introduce yourself. And you're like, Hi, give me money. But you have to explain why you're important. And then the brand message statement, which is my personal favorite, because I think it most clearly says what we're talking about. So, when I say your messaging has four parts, those four parts can be molded into a few sentences, which is the brand message statement. Okay.

[00:12:06.270] - Liz
So that brand message statement, I'm going to give you guys a template. So, if you're like, oh, my God, Liz, that slides over, you can rewind, but stay with me because I'm going to show you what we're talking about here. But this should be communicated everywhere you are. So, like, no matter whether you're on Facebook or like, your website or like, your bio and you guest blog somewhere else, I want it to be really really clear how you and your brand or website solve the problem and who you help and how you solve it.

[00:12:38.370] - Liz
So, then when people come across who you are, they can make a really quick judgment call about how you fit into their world. And if you do right. Sometimes people, when I talk about the who you help, the target audience stuff, people get really choked up and they're like, oh, you're going to make me niche down. And I don't want to. And I'd be like, you do you.

[00:13:00.860] - Liz
But you have to start somewhere and you don't want to serve your content to people that aren't truly interested. That's the other thing, right. So like,  and when you start to niche and you start to become really clear who you'd love to help, they will show up. They show up more. And in fact, people that fall outside your niche will like that.

[00:13:19.620] - Liz
You're wicked clear. And people that fall outside your niche that are still meant to read your content and absorb it. They'll still be there, too. That's what people think, like, they're closing doors. No, like you're just being better at your job.

[00:13:32.020] - Liz
And when you remember the why stuff, like the why is not in this template, because the Y is sometimes goes on for pages. When you really think about why, you do this, right. But when you think about your why, it becomes why more important to be clearing your messaging, because when you're clearing your messaging, everything else works. So, let's write yours, right? And then I'm not a copywriter.

[00:13:54.400] - Liz
Oh, my God. I'd be like, no, remember how I said that doesn't matter. But you know what, this one. I almost got rid of it because I did this earlier, but it's still so funny.

[00:14:02.950] - Liz
I just had to keep it. So, if you go back, I know you guys are getting dizzy. If we go back here, we're going to do, like, each one of these things, these four parts. That's what's going to make up the next few slides.

[00:14:14.770] - Liz
So, I'm going to be breaking this down really with you. So we're starting with who you help? The target demographic, target audience, ideal client, customer avatars. These are so many words, ideal reader. What makes them happy, what makes them tick?

[00:14:28.050] - Liz
What drives them crazy, what's their daily life like. And the reason why I asked this is and I'm just going to say, because we talked about body conference. Let's switch gears for examples. Right. And we'll talk about mom blogs because there are so many mom blogs and not in a bad way.

[00:14:43.130] - Liz
I think we need them. We need you mom bloggers, please stay. But when you think about blogging for a mom or creating content for a mom, it's going to be different than how you create content for other types of ideal readers. Why? Because oh, my god, I'm so tired.

[00:15:00.010] - Liz
That's one thing. I'm tired all the time. I never read long form posts. I have a toddler. So, you guys might be writing for me.

[00:15:06.920] - Liz
I never read long social media posts. I have friends that write them, and I click like, anyway, but I don't read them because I just don't have time for it. And then you're like, well, then moms must like videos. And then yes. But there's a however, right.

[00:15:21.780] - Liz
The however, is that even though I like video content, pardon me, if you do hear my baby, he is a little loud here, but I don't know if it will come through in the audio. But yeah, we like videos, but sometimes we have to watch them on mute, because if our son hears us watching a video, he'll want to watch his favorite cartoon on our phone. Right. So, then you need captions on the video. So like, these are things to think about. A lot of people watch things on mute.

[00:15:46.820] - Liz
This is the thing that people miss. For example, I shopped it with this boutique, and I can't wait until they do close captioning because I just can't listen. Sometimes they'll be like, use coupon code to save money or something. And it's a live sale. And you can actually have live captioning.

[00:16:05.090] - Liz
Now, I don't know if you guys know that, but Zoom has live captioning. It just came out. So, I want you to think about your ideal reader, right. So, if it is somebody like me, are you engineering your content appropriately for them? Somebody who does a really great job at kind of diversifying presentation of content is Business insider.

[00:16:27.080] - Liz
And I know that's not like a blog. It's like a newspaper kind of thing online news magazine. However, what I love about it is that at the beginning of every article, they give bullet points. So, then for people that have no time, they have a way of absorbing the content without having to give up too much of their day. Right.

[00:16:45.160] - Liz
So like, that's my personal example. So think about your ideal reader. What are they like, and how do you think that they would like to avoid what you have to offer? And also how can you diversify the mediums through which you actually deliver the content? So, now we're getting into the problem that you solve and what you help people do.

[00:17:02.460] - Liz
And you're like, you know I'm just a blog. I don't solve problems. And then you have this weird voice, I guess, because that's how I just impersonated you. But if you're not sure, like I've said before, not knowing this stuff is really normal. It's weirder to be me telling you how to do things.

[00:17:18.300] - Liz
So, like accept that I'm the weird one. And then once you accept it, I have this little prompt that might be really fun for you. It's called the I totally get you exercise. And so, sometimes I also call it the Edgies. So if you guys have watched anything else that I've done talks at or whatever, I also call this the Edgies.

[00:17:37.130] - Liz
But the Edgies are all about getting into the brain of your person. So like, we did talk about the who you help. Now we're talking about the problem that you solve. But the Edgy process and the Edgy exercise gets you clear on the person, and it gets you clear on the problem that you solve because it takes you from being like, well, I'm just a website about cars to being like, oh, I'm a website that teaches women how to maintain their own automobile. Oh, my God.

[00:18:04.140] - Liz
There's this wicked funny lady. What if she's watching now? She's probably not. But listen, no, she's a video blogger, and she's called like, well, clearly she should hire me because I don't remember what she's called. But I think she's called, like, the car reviewing mom or something, and all she does is review minivans, and she'll go to dealerships and take videos going through minivans. Being like, this one has a video in the backseat.

[00:18:29.370] - Liz
This one has two screens. This one does this, this one like, whatever. Right? She's a hoot. Anyway.

[00:18:37.560] - Liz
So, now you're going to go Google it, but she's really clear on the problem that she solves because talk about uncomfortable to be a woman going to a dealership. But like, by creating the content that she's creating, she's giving women information and information is power. And then women can go buy cars and feel equipped without having to bring in their mean aunt or, like, angry husband or whatever. Whoever you bring to the dealership with you. Everybody has that person and their family, right?

[00:19:04.600] - Liz
That helps them buy cars angry. And those people are very valuable people. So, think about the problem that you solve So, then that woman went from being a person that just does videos about cars. And now she's a woman that creates content specifically for women to help them feel more empowered when shopping for a car.

[00:19:19.860] - Liz
I know, right? Did I sell her so good to you guys? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I did. So, this is a little FYI for you. 

[00:19:28.070] - Liz
So, sometimes when we do the edgy exercise, which is like, I totally get that you get wicked afraid when you want to go buy a car, because it's really scary because everybody that works there is a shark, and they all are sweaty and angry and stuff. So, like, that's the example of the actual get used that we were just talking about. But when you do the actual get used, sometimes you're like, oh, my god. All I'm writing about our problems, and no one wants to hear problems because we have pandemics and social justice issues and student loan debt.

[00:19:58.130] - Liz
And I'd be like, look, take a breath and you'd go, oh, god, I really needed that breath.

[00:20:03.440] - Liz
But you will you'll take a breath and you'll realize that talking about problems doesn't make you Bumtown USA and just to not offend anyone, I put Bumtown USA in the Boston area because that's where I'm from. And I feel like if I picked another part of the country, somebody would be mad. So, now it's just anybody that lives here will be mad because obviously, I don't think that there's really a Bumtown USA, although somebody that could be watching this from Bumtown USA could be like, you spelled my town that I'd be like, oh, my God, I'm so excited to meet you.

[00:20:33.310] - Liz
But, yeah, listen, when we talk about the edgies, we're talking about our customer and reader problems, that's huge. And here are some reasons why pain shows empathy.

[00:20:45.390] - Liz
Right. So, then, oh, my god, the person feels understood. I never feel understood. My whole life has been a misunderstanding. Right?

[00:20:53.630] - Liz
But like when a website understands me, I'm like, oh, my god. Here's my routing and checking account number. How can you suck me drive for money? And I know that's an exaggeration. But people open their hearts and their wallets at the same time if they feel understood.

[00:21:08.530] - Liz
Okay. So, pain shows empathy and understanding. And pain also raises the stakes. So, like, it takes that woman from being a woman that makes videos about cars and showing their features to being a woman, that makes you feel equipped and confident when you go to a dealership. And when you talk about how feeling equipped and confident is how scary it is to go to a dealership and buy a car by yourself. Then you're like, oh, my god, that is a way more important video blog now because you reminded me why it's important or I'm looking for.

[00:21:44.410] - Liz
Okay, like, let's say you're a lifestyle blogger because I think a lot of lifestyle bloggers miss out on the messaging stuff because they're like, Well, let me just look like an influencer and everything will come together. But I feel like one thing that I wish, the edge that's going to make somebody an influencer from a lifestyle blogger is that it's not when you're talking about the beauty products it's when you're talking about how those products make people feel. Right? So, it's not about contouring. It's about the before and then the after.

[00:22:14.820] - Liz
It's about talking to somebody that's always wanted to feel wicked pretty.

[00:22:18.340] - Liz
And maybe like, if they read your blog and do the things that you're showing them how to do, that's what it's really about. It's transforming the way somebody views themselves, self esteem, all that stuff. So, then you're like, oh, my god, I'm not just a beauty blogger. I'm changing people's lives. And then before you guys are laughing because you're like, Liz, that's really dramatic.

[00:22:38.180] - Liz
Well, one. Yeah, I was a theater major. It's going to be dramatic. But likealso two, if it's not dramatically important, then why are we doing this? Why?

[00:22:49.750] - Liz
Okay. How do you solve the problem? So, this doesn't require much thought. What does your website actually do for people, say what it is you exist to do what's the number one thing people get from you? So, like, this is just because sometimes when you go to a website and you'll be like, this is a blog about everything.

[00:23:06.150] - Liz
This is making sure that in your brand message statement, you're really really specific about what you're actually there to help people do. And so this will be like, I'm a beauty blog. So, then people don't get confused and think you're writing about Manila bonnet or shoes or, like, Blazers. Right. And then the why so, the why has kind of permeated everything that we're talking about.

[00:23:28.720] - Liz
Right. So, this can be dual. I started my business because I had a bad boss. Now it's been so long that this doesn't even resonate with why I started my business anywhere. But it's true.

[00:23:40.390] - Liz
But then when you really think about it, it's because I wanted others to have the fame they crave to show up as themselves boldly and confidently and to be a star. And actually looking back, talk about the worst feeling in the world is when you audition for a play and then you get like, you're in the chorus and you're like, this sucks. Right. And I think what people miss out on is that you can be the star of your own life. And so, it's sort of like stepping out from backstage and running your own show.

[00:24:07.620] - Liz
And that's what I'm all about. And I think when you show up in your own business that way, and when you start looking at your blood like a business, like a company, like a brand, everything's more important. Example time, I was supposed to sing that. That's why I sang it. So, here I am.

[00:24:23.570] - Liz
Here's mine. Right. So hey, I'm Liz Theresa. I help entrepreneurs get clear and rise to be the star of your business through my blog and podcast. Or it could be through coaching website and brand design program.

[00:24:34.170] - Liz
So that my blog and podcast. That's like how I do it. Right. The problem I solve being get clear because most people are not clear. I totally get that you don't know your message and you feel like you're showing up like a big storm cloud and other things because you're all foggy all the time.

[00:24:50.890] - Liz
I help entrepreneurs. Could I be more niche than that? Yes, but you do. You don't feel like everybody. Because if you google had a niche, you're going to just watch hours and hours of videos about Niching.

[00:25:02.570] - Liz
That's not how you arrive at anything organically. Who's ever made a decision that way in life. Try to take things easy and go with the flow and remember this, nothing is permanent. Your messaging and your copy. It is all a living document.

[00:25:16.070] - Liz
I always say branding is a living document too. That's like when people think that they picked a logo and that's it. Look at how many logos like Coca Cola has had. Everybody goes through logo after logo, don't aim for perfection. Just aim to settle into something that resonates with you right now, because when it resonates with you right now, everything will flow like water.

But like when you try to force yourself to suddenly be different or do what you think you should be doing, that's the moment you're going to fail. And once you get clear on that message statement using this kind of a template, right? That should synergize anywhere you show up online across your website, bottom of blog posts, in your bio, social media, throughout your content in order for the messaging to be a magnet. Because the thing that makes the messaging magnetic is that you say it all the time.

So, it's magnetic when it's in the template like that.

[00:26:13.730] - Liz
Right? That template is just there to help you because it has all the different components that people that are like, quick readers like me. We look for that because everybody's like, do I want you in my world? Yes or no? That's a very quick decision people make when they're reading things online.

They don't even know they're making a decision. When they say, I'm not going to click something where I'm going to click it, and then I'm going to leave right away because this isn't for me, right? So thinking about that, you don't have a ton of time, which is why the messaging is the thing that's going to be the linchpin on which conversions and everything else can come. Okay. Because once you get your messaging right, everything else works, because any marketing you do is only as effective as your messaging.

And your website is like the number two.

[00:26:58.060] - Liz
But like messaging is number one, and if you ignore it, everything costs you more money. And if you feel foggy about it or like this really annoys you or triggers you, then it means that you should spend your time working on it. So, once we get your messaging as strong and sturdy as Thor, as strong as we can, we can then focus on spending money on the other stuff that you might think is more fun, like funnels or Facebook ads or whatever. I don't know what's hot right now.

[00:27:25.630] - Liz
Everything is exciting to spend money on, right?

[00:27:28.450] - Liz
But you got to get the messaging right first. So, here's some three little steps to get you going right. Review how you're currently showing up. What's your current brand message statement? Do you have one like, do you have one? And it's like hiding. Sometimes that's true.

Or if you have one. And the second thing is the kicker here. Does it actually resonate with or align with your goals? So, given everything that we've just been talking about, does it feel edgy? Does it make sense?
