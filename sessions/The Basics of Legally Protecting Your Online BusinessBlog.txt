Hey, everyone. Welcome to the session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to have you. I'm going to be covering the basics of legally protecting your online business. So this session is geared towards beginner bloggers, newer bloggers. It's not saying that if you've already started, if you haven't taken care of your legal stuff, you should definitely watch this. And you can certainly watch the intermediate and advanced sessions. I will be teaching later in the day. But this is really just going over the basics. So if you're wondering who I am, I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm an attorney, I'm a blogger, and I'm the host of this summit. And I'm super excited that you're here. I started my very first blog back in 2014, so over 10 years ago, and it was in the personal finance space. I then in 2017, 2018, saw a lot of scaremongering in the online business space about the legal side of things, which is just completely unnecessary. The legal stuff is super, super important, but I'm a firm believer that doesn't have to be scary or hard. I've been writing on that and helping bloggers and all my business owners with the legal side of stuff since 2017, 2018 over at elizabethstapleton.com.

[00:01:13.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And then in 2019, I got the idea to start the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. The first one was held in February 2020. I'm super excited to be here hosting it for the sixth time. Let's go ahead and dive in. Before we start, I do just want to encourage you to turn off your phone, close any other tabs and get rid of distractions. Like I said, this stuff is super important. It doesn't need to be scary or hard, and we're going to make it super approachable and easy to understand. But you need to focus on how to do that. Next up, I do just have a quick disclaimer. Nothing presented here is legal advice. While I have a background as an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is for informational and educational purposes only. It's not legal advice. You may need to talk to a lawyer to get specific answers, but this should hopefully get you started that you know the right questions to ask if you have to ask questions. Let's go ahead and put your mind at ease. Here's what we're going to cover today. We're going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what you should include.

[00:02:10.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We're going to talk about various data privacy laws, what they are, why they matter, Talk about how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every piece of content. Then finally, we're going to talk about what you should know about disclaimers in order to limit your liability and protect your blog. Let's get started. Take a deep breath. Like I said, super important, but it's not going to be scary or hard. We're going to make this easy. All right, so why do you need to have a privacy policy? Basically, a lot of laws, and this is just a good general understanding, a lot of these laws that you have to comply with exist because people were being shady. If you approach it and think of it of, Okay, how can I be open, honest, and transparent with my audience? In most cases, that's going to be doing what you need to do to comply. There's various federal and state laws in the US and international laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which out of the EU and does potentially apply, even if you're based in the US. That says you need to tell people what you're doing with the data if and when you collect it.

[00:03:11.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Again, it's about being open and transparent, which is a great way to build trust with your audience and just let them know what you're up to. If you think you're not collecting data, I'm going to encourage you to think again, because pretty much everyone, every website owner is collecting some data. For example, if you're using Google Analytics, you're collecting data. If you do email marketing, you have forms on your site, you're collecting email addresses and names, potentially. If you have a contact form, if you allow comments, these are all examples of data. If you have any pixel tracking for Facebook ads or Pinterest or things like that, those are all examples. It's pretty hard to run a website and a blog and online business successfully without collecting data. Basically, your privacy policy is your place where you explain what data you collect, how you collect it, why you collect it, and under what provision of consent you are collecting or if you need consent. Here are the things you're going to be including your privacy policy. You want to make sure you're providing clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their data is being used.

[00:04:12.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So information you collect, whether it's personal, anonymous, what tools you use that might be storing that data. If you have display ads, what does that look like? Is that data collected? Just keeping those things in mind. Your cookie policy, affiliate relationships, California Residence Rights Contact information. Your contact information is required on your privacy policy. It could be contact page. It doesn't necessarily have to be an email address, but you need to have something on there. You should also be including when the page was last updated and how long you keep whatever data it is you collect. So these are the things that will go into your privacy policy. And we'll cover this more at the end. There is a default privacy policy in WordPress. It's a great starting point. You're also going to explain how How consumers or your audience can exercise their consumer rights in terms of opting out of things or turning down cookies and things like that. So like I said, we'll go over this some more. But let's We're going to go ahead and talk a little more about the various data privacy laws and what they mean. The biggest and most well known is GDPR, which is the General Data Protection Regulation.

[00:05:25.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Part of the reason is a lot of laws today are behind on technology. We're seeing more and more laws coming up regarding data privacy as they catch up to the times and the online world that we live in. GDPR came out of the European Union. It went into effect in 2018. Since then, there's been the California Consumer Protection Act, where basically all these laws are just requiring you to inform users of the data you collect and the rights they are entitled to. GDPR is a great standard. If you are complying with GDPR, you're in shape to just go ahead to meet whatever necessary requirements, new laws, particularly in the states, because that's going on a state-by-state basis are requiring. GDPR applies to anyone who has an audience based in the EU because it's the rights of those EU residents that you have to respect. And not even residents, they just have to be located in the EU. So yes, it's going to apply if you yourself are based in the EU. But if you have an audience located in the EU, maybe you're a travel blogger, right? And you have posts on traveling to Spain while people in France are traveling to Spain.

[00:06:36.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's going to apply. Or maybe you're a military blogger. Well, are people located not on the base, but out in France, stuff applies. GDPR is a great standard to try to hold yourself up to. I have a whole GDPR guide that I will be sure to link to below this video that can help you with understanding GDPR and what you need to do to comply. But there's actually been a lot of other laws passed, particularly in the States. CCPA, pretty well known at this point, Brazil's data privacy law, Colorado, passed one that went into effect July of '23, Connecticut, same thing, Delaware. These are ones that are Coming into effect this year, next year are in bold. Except Utah because that's 2024, and Virginia, which was 2023. But for the most part, so coming into effect this year, we have Delaware, we have Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nebraska, and Tennessee. So it's all come into effect this year. Most of them actually came into effect this month, and a couple going into effect in 2026 as well. And I'm sure we're going to continue to see more and more states pass data privacy laws.

[00:07:50.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And if you're wondering, why do they keep doing this? I'm sure you remember the time, it's not as common these days, but way back when so and so had a data breach two years ago and they just told their customers. We've all seen those headlines. This is why these laws are coming into effect. Next, you have to figure out if they apply to you. Scope and applicability. Generally, a scope clause is laid out like this in each of these laws, because all the laws are pretty similar, but it does vary state by state. Conducts business in the state, and then it's either or. You control or process the personal data of not less than 35,000 For some states it's up to 100,000 consumers. Or you control and process at least 25,000 state residents and derive more than 50% of your gross revenue from the sale personal data. So sale personal data does include revenue from display ads. So this might apply to you if you make a lot with display ads and you have an audience. If you've got lots and lots of page views, if you're one of those people that has 100,000 page views or more, depending on if it's super localized or not, this might apply to you.

[00:09:06.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, the OR clause, this part, really varies state by state. Some states, it's as low as 10,000 and does the % gross revenue as low as 20%. It varies state by state. You should definitely do a little Google search if you are located in one of those states that I showed you and see if this is going to apply to you. Okay? Sometimes the law only applies if the business is making in excess of a certain amount. In Florida, their Data Privacy Act only applies if you make in excess of a billion dollars. They're going after Disney. They're not going after you. And in Tennessee, it's like if the business makes more than 5 million. A lot of times it'll exclude personal data that's processed for the purpose of completing payment transactions. So it's not counting the data for all the purchases people made from you. Some states, like Nebraska and Texas, exclude small businesses from having this apply. And the small business is typically defined by the US SBA. They're like, Whatever that's the definition, That's what we mean. Which currently, the SBA defines a US small business as organized for profit, has a place of business in the US, operates primarily within the US, or makes a significant contribution to the US economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor, is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field on a national basis.

[00:10:36.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's a pretty broad definition, but I'd say most of us probably fall into that category. All right. What do What do you need to do to comply with all the various state requirements? Basically, you need to have an updated privacy policy that covers all the things we talked about. You need to make sure if you have an email list that you have the proper consent to be emailing them. You should probably install and activate a cookie banner depending on what tools you're using. Set up a way for consumers to opt out of the sale personal information and also have a contact page on your site. So these are things you should be doing. A couple of things you shouldn't be doing is you shouldn't be blocking traffic from locations that have data privacy laws, and you shouldn't charge different rates for those that do or do not exercise their rates. Just don't be a jerk. Don't block yourself. Let's move on. Now we're going to talk about affiliate disclosures because affiliate marketing is one of those things that even if you're brand new, you can get started with. You can start applying to affiliate programs and putting affiliate links on your site so you can start earning passive income.

[00:11:37.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It may take a while before that income actually starts to happen, but it's one of those things that you can do foundationally. We want to make sure that you aren't earning those potential earnings or future earnings at risk by ensuring you're properly disclosing your affiliate relationship for every content. The FTC, the File of Trade Commission in the US, is what regulation this and says what is an appropriate disclosure. The language matters. These are the key elements you want to look at. Language matters. A lot of times I see this, people will just post at the top of their blog post saying, This post contains affiliate links. However, that's not enough because not everyone knows what affiliate marketing is. Think about it. Before you got into this world, did you know what that term meant? It's very much like a term in our niche in this whole online business world, and a lot of other people don't know what it means. If you're going to use the term affiliate link, you need to then explain what it means. As a good rule of thumb, I like to say if your grandma want to understand it, then it's not clear enough.

[00:12:39.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So a better example would be something like, this post contains affiliate links, meaning I earn a commission if you click through and purchase through my link, something like that. So it's explaining what that term affiliate link means. Another key element is the position on the page matters. So your disclosure has to be before they can click on the link, period. So don't put it in the sidebar because a lot of people view things on mobile and on mobile, sidebars are pushed down to the bottom, which means then it would not be compliant. So this applies not just to blog posts, but it applies to emails. I see this mistake made a lot in email marketing where people just include an affiliate disclosure at the bottom of their email and that is not compliant. It has to be before they can click on the link. So make sure. And then size matters. You can't make your disclosure teeny tiny. It needs to be the same size as whatever your normal text on the page is. Okay? So we're going to keep going. If you guys have questions, be sure to comment below. I will be in the comments to answer those questions.

[00:13:45.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Now let's talk about it's easy enough in an email and a blog post to disclose. You're not limited by characters, but social media is its own beast. Where do you put those affiliate disclosures in social media posts? It still has to be before the link. It should also not be in a group of hashtags. I know hashtags are going out of style, but it can't be buried in a sea of hashtags. Because characters are sometimes limited, the FTC knows this, and they actually have a great guide on disclosing in social media. They suggest using terms people understand. So #ad, #sponsored, #paidpartner. And some platforms even let you place a setting that shows it's a paid partnership. Instagram does that, I know for sure. So just making sure you're disclosing that affiliate relationship. And the reason you want to do that is because people have right to know if you're going to get paid for what you're saying. Even if you're not letting that influence what you would say, they still need to know. And that's why the FTC requires this. All right, so like I said, I already touched on this, but it needs to be before the link.

[00:14:53.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host
One thing I like to do for my email broadcast, and I would suggest others do too, if they I have trouble remembering the language or whatnot, is I use Kit, formerly Convert Kit, and what I do is I create a content snippet of my affiliate disclosure, and that way I can just easily pop it in there for the stuff that contains affiliate disclosures. But again, don't put your disclosure at the bottom of your email. It has to be before they can click on the link. Let's move on. What to know about disclaimers to limit your liability. Disclaimers are a little bit different than disclosures. Let's talk about the difference.  Disclosures is where you're making sure the reader is informed of something, for example, that you have an affiliate relationship. Whereas a disclaimer, you're telling your readers that you're not responsible for something. I did it at the beginning of this session where I was like, I may be an attorney I'm not your attorney. This is informational educational purposes. I'm not responsible for what you then decide to do with this information is really what that amounts to. A disclaimer is just a little bit different from a disclosure, but you often find them on the same page.

[00:16:02.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let's go ahead and go through some examples of disclaimers that may apply to you depending on what you're doing. The first one I like to touch on is a professional and nonprofessional disclaimer. If you blog in a specialized area, you need to let your reader know any qualifications you have or are missing. This is important to SEO in terms of EEAT, which is E-E-A-T. I'm going to let you guys watch the SEO sessions on that. But an example is this. If you remember, I started in the personal finance space. My first blog is personal finance, but I am not a personal finance professional. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a financial advisor. I'm just somebody who is sharing their experience with personal finance. I had no expertise in that area. That's why I said, Hey, this is information that I've learned, that I've put together, that I'm sharing, but I'm not an expert. I disclosed that or disclaimed, Hey, I'm not a professional. You might want to talk to one. Another Another area you see this a lot is in health and wellness. Fitness might be one. Like I said, money, legal, licensing, things like that.

[00:17:11.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Those are some areas where if you don't have any professional qualifications, you should say so, so they know who they're learning from. And if you do, say so too, like I did here. Hey, I may be an attorney, but I'm not your attorney. So both professional and nonprofessional disclaimers are two sides of the same coin. Moving on. Earnings and testimonial disclaimers. Now, if you're just starting out, this may not apply to you, but if you get to the point where you're selling digital products and you're using testimonials to help sell them, or maybe you're putting together blog income reports because those are always fun to read. Then you need to make sure you're including an earnings and/or testimonial disclaimer. Basically, you're saying you can't promise they're going to achieve the same results. Everyone's a little bit different. Circumstances change, things like that. You just need to say, Hey, these are examples of what is possible, but I can't guarantee that you're going to achieve this. That's what those are doing. Let's go ahead and recap what we talked about. We talked about how to properly dispose affiliate relationships, and the same goes for sponsored or otherwise.

[00:18:18.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We talked about various data privacy laws and why they matter and how to comply. We talked about what disclaimers are and how to use them to your advantage. And we talked about why you need a privacy policy and what to include in it. We're going to talk about next, putting it into action. From the very start, you should have these pages on your site. Even if you're a brand new blogger, you're going to want a privacy policy page and then a disclaimers and disclosures page. Here, again, is what you're going to include in your privacy Privacy Policy. This will be available in a checklist that I'll link below. Then this is the... Last I checked, the default WordPress privacy policy for using WordPress includes these things in white. It doesn't necessarily have these other things, but it's a great place to start. Then these are different disclosures and disclaimers you might want to consider including. I did put some asterisks here just because these are maybe ones you don't need from the start. You might need a professional or nonprofessional disclaimer. I talked about a general disclaimer that's always good of like, Hey, I'm not responsible for your actions, and things like that.

[00:19:24.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We didn't dig into these too much, but those are things you'll likely want to include as well. All right, so how do you pull this stuff together? Do you have to hire an attorney? You're just starting out. Maybe you don't have money to do that, and that's fine. If you can afford to hire an attorney, that's always going to be your best option. I'm saying this as someone who does not offer those services. But if you can afford to hire an attorney, that's always going to be your best option. The alternatives is start with the default WordPress privacy policy and then cross your fingers for a bit. You can cobble together other policies using various sources or the internet. Never just copy someone's because you don't know that it really applies to you properly. And then there's copyright issues and all that jazz. And you might have actually some templates that you've gotten in bundles and whatnot, and you may be able to cobble something together. That's always an option. I think one of the best options is to grab legal templates written by a lawyer that understands blogging. And when I started in this space, there weren't a lot of us, but fortunately, there are now.

[00:20:24.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So yes, I have some. I'm not going to do some big pitch on my templates, but there's a lot out there, and you might already have some, and that's great. But this is a great, I think, medium place. If you can't afford an attorney and you're just starting out, find an attorney that sells legal templates and understands this world. Not all of them do. I will say, well, I'm not going to do a pitch. I will say, I really like them, and I think they're awesome, and they come with a generator and all that jazz. Here's just some positive things that people have said about them. Thank you for being here. I do have a gift for you guys, which hopefully is showing in the video in the recording, it's deciding to not show. We'll see. But I'm going to give you guys my Smart Bloggers Guidebook to the Legal Side of Blogging. I usually sell this for like $30 bucks thereabouts. You can get it completely free this week. While the summit's live, just go to elizabethstapleton.com/go/2025bbs, and you can get that for free. It not only covers the stuff that I went over today, but it covers accessibility, it covers AI, some of the other topics I'll be covering in the other legal sessions for the summit.

[00:21:33.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's just a nice general guidebook on the legal side of blogging. If you guys have any questions, I am in the chat and I'm happy to hang out for a little bit. I hope you found this helpful. I hope you're not feeling overwhelmed and that you feel like this is approachable and you have some ideas of the right next steps for you. Again, thank you guys for coming. Maybe I'll see you at the other legal sessions, maybe not. I don't know, but I'll definitely see you around the summit because I am the host and I'm going to be all over the place. Have a great rest of your day and enjoy the rest of the sessions.
