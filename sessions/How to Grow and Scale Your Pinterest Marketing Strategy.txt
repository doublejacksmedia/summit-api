[00:00:09.170] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
Guys, I'm super excited for the session with Kristen Larson from Become a Pinterest today and believe in a budget. Christine, thank you so much for being here. I'm excited to have you.

[00:00:17.750] - Kristen Larsen, pinterestva.com
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

[00:00:19.910] - Liz
Because I learned so much from from you in terms of Pinterest marketing. I actually did work as a Pinterest VA. I have a couple of clients I still hold on to, but I moved away from other stuff. But it was such a great course that I took from you. We're not selling you this course. I'm just saying Kristen knows her stuff. But yeah. So, I know you got a lot to share with us. I'm going to let you just take over.

[00:00:43.550] - Kristen
Okay, cool. I'm excited to be here. And I want to talk about how to grow and scale your Pinterest marketing strategy as a blogger, because I know first hand, when I started my blog back in 2015, I started at scratch, I started at zero. And whether you're brand new blogger trying to figure out how Pinterest works or you've been a blogger, but you haven't quite figured out, what you do with Pinterest. I feel like we can go over some really great topics today. So, the first one I want to talk about is the big question, like why Pinterest? And I know we have all heard about the benefits of it. And I was actually on their website recently and I learned a couple of fun facts. The first one is- I even wrote these down. 97% of top searches on Pinterest are unbranded. And basically what that means is that we all have a clean slate as a blogger. That means when somebody goes on there to do a search, they're not specifically looking for a certain website or a product or anything specific. It is our opportunity for us all to be equal and really have an amazing pIn. So, I think that's really cool. And the other thing Pinterest said was "Before a user has made up their minds with a blog or brand to work with, this is your time to reach and build an audience." So, I think that's also really cool, too, because this gives us an opportunity to reach so many people. We have no idea where they're coming from, but we know whatever kind of blog posts we're publishing, someone is on there looking for your content. So, I just think it's really neat that, you know, we're- we're not in the whole starting out. We are just fresh and people can find us. And I just think it's really, really cool.

[00:02:30.440] - Liz
Yeah, no, I- everyone sort of starts from the same baseline, whereas I mean, I love SEO and google and that's amazing. But it takes a lot longer to get traction there. I mean, take you can take a while to get traction on Pinterest, but not nearly as long.

[00:02:43.880] - Kristen
Yeah. And I think what's interesting is that like a few years ago, especially when I got started, you could publish a pin and start to get traffic like crazy within like a week. Now it's a little bit longer, but it is still the fastest tool that I have personally found in terms of having that reach and getting clicks and traffic back to my website and for clients websites, that kind of thing.

[00:03:06.400] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:03:06.790] - Kristen
So, a couple other things I want to talk about is why Pinterest works as long as you follow the rules. So my biggest thing I have noticed, especially the past six months or so, is that we're hearing a lot of gossip and chatter, but we don't know what's true and what's not. And I think it's so easy for us to be in a group setting online and start to say, "Well, this isn't working. So Pinterest is out and it's no longer a thing I'm going to focus on. And I'm going to go here instead." And the thing is, it's gossip. We just don't know. We have to really just listen to Pinterest and what they're saying. You know, there's different hacks, I guess, out there or different strategies. I think that works. But I think at the end of the day, we just need to listen to what Pinterest is telling us. One of the biggest things they told us in 2020 was all about the fresh pin. And for a lot of us, it was creating a brand new pin, whether it was for a new blog post or an older blog post. So guess what? We all did it. We were like, "Okay, Pinterest, we're going to do this." And we all started creating a ton of images for blog content. Recently, Pinterest came out and said, "You know what, this still isn't the ideal experience for the user and it's all about the user." So, their new strategy, they want us to focus on it as a creator, as bloggers is just creating one great Pin for one piece of content. So, all blog posts that we're going to be writing in the future. Let's just make one killer pin and focus on sharing that where we think it's going to be seeing the most online. So, it could be one of your own personal boards you created on Pinterest. You know, group words are still a thing. They don't work for everybody. But if you are in a group board that has great traction, share it there. Right. So, I think that's a really helpful tip from Pinterest. And then the other thing I have to say about that is Pinterest wasn't created for bloggers. And I think sometimes we kind of had this conversation where we're like, "Well, how dare Pinterest do this? And now my views are down and my impressions think at the end of the day, it's all about the users experience. We're just there trying to hopefully monetize and get traffic back to our website. So, I think we have to remember that because even I get mad if I'm like, "What happened to my page views? What happened to my traffic? And it's again, it's about the user. Does that make sense?

[00:05:30.890] - Liz
Yes.

[00:05:31.070] - Kristen
It should.

[00:05:31.070] - Liz
I feel like it should. Yeah, no, I feel like if there's one thing you take away from the Summit because we've covered it over and over again in so many sessions, it's all about user intent. What experience are your readers having or what the experience- experience of someone on Pinterest or searching for something on Google? Or whatever it is, it's all goes back to user intent and trying to answer whatever it is they're looking for.

[00:05:55.580] - Kristen
Yes, I totally agree. So, with that being said, that there's two things I think we should be focusing on. So, it's going to be solid SEO, which you talked about a minute ago, and then our Pin design. We need to have both of those in order for our pins to show up in the search result. We've all heard a million times Pinterest is a visual search engine, so it's not just straight up Google. So, we have to focus on making a beautiful pin that is going to catch your eye. But we also have to have a reason behind it. So when it comes to SEO, our biggest thing we need to focus on are keywords. Are keywords are everywhere. And a keyword is your bio about yourself. When you create your profile, it's going to be the name of your group board, etc. It's going to be a name of your personal board. It's going to be a description of your board. It's going to be the description of your pin like that is where our keywords are at. We have so many opportunities to use keywords about our blog posts. So I'm going to give you guys an example. One of them is I'm going to find it. So, I wanted to make sure I went through my stats to show what is working. I have this pin from 2016. It is still doing great. I have pins I created six months ago that are just not getting any traffic. And I have this one pin from 2016 and it is all about saving money at the grocery store. And that is something that is evergreen, it's not seasonal, it's not trendy. People are going to be searching on how to save money all the time.

[00:07:26.870] - Kristen
So, I have this pin and so I have this pin and I think, Okay, if this pin is doing really well, I should make a personal board and talk more about saving money at the grocery store. So I create a board and I'm going to call it "Grocery Store Budgeting". Those are some great keywords to be using. Then for the description of the board, I'm going to call it "How to Save Money and Stick to a Budget while grocery shopping". So while there is a tiny bit of overlap with the keywords, I'm also inserting new words like money, shopping and sort of saying grocery store budgeting. Then from there, my pin is going to say, "breaking down my weekly fifty dollar grocery budget." That's what it was like five years ago as a single person. So totally different, but again, different keywords. And then when I go through that and I see how much traffic it's getting, it makes me think, "Okay, how can I create a new blog post?"

[00:08:23.480] - Kristen
So, my new blog post then is "How to Save Money on Groceries as a Couple". So that's just different things you can do for like more blog content, which is what we're talking about. But it just goes to show how you can start taking one, can turn it into a board, start adding more content, content to it and start getting a lot more traffic. So, that's just one example. I think if you're a blogger, look at your top five blog posts, see which ones are doing well, doing that. Do they have great boards? Like have you created your own personal board? Are there any killer group boards still out there? Check your descriptions. How can you add on to it? There's just so much you can do with just five of your blog posts if you go on forever.

[00:09:04.520] - Kristen
Another thing I want to talk about for finding your keywords, because people I get this question. A lot of people just don't understand where these. Words come from one of the best ways I like to find key words, Okay let me back up. The basic way is to do a search and type in "saving money at the grocery store" and it's going to pop up a ton of pennies. So cool. I can see who else is posting about this type of thing or sharing pens. Below that search bar. You're going to see lots of bubbles that help you make like longer sentences that have more like specific words to them. But my favorite one is inside of doing a promoted pin. Promoted pins, you do not have to run a promoted pin campaign and pay if you want to just do keyword research. So, I have been doing this forever. So, you go in and pretend you're creating a promoted pen, you're going to walk through a few different steps, but then you're going to get to this like magical keyword box and you're going to go ahead and type in like grocery shopping. And from there you're going to hit enter and it's going to populate like hundreds or thousands of phrases that have to do with grocery shopping. And from there, it'll say, well, this one's had three million searches. This one's had okay, maybe one hundred searches. So, you're going to kind of go through and organize ones that you think would really work to your audience. And you're going to take those keywords and then you put them in your forward description, your Pin description, the name of your board, everything. So it's a little bit more of an advanced feature. It sounds a little crazy, but everyone should be doing this because it is free and it's organic.

[00:10:42.860] - Liz
Yeah, no, I, I've actually run a couple of pins in the past and I never thought to just go use the keyboard part so...

[00:10:49.690] - Kristen
Yeah, it seems intimidating because a lot of times people start with the promoted pins and they're like, "Uh, I'm just going to keep hitting enter but I don't know what's going to happen. No, you can do it for free. I like to copy and paste, put them into a spreadsheet. And that way when I'm creating blog posts in the future, I know what keywords are really popular on Pinterest and then I kind of put them into my blog post. So, I think there's a lot you can do with that.

[00:11:16.590] - Liz
Got it.

[00:11:17.040] - Kristen
Okay. The next thing I want to talk about, I first I said SEO is killer. The second one, of course, is our Pin design. Pinterest has been really good to us for a while about our sizing. When I started in 2015 as a Pinterest virtual assistant, one of the main reasons I was getting hired by bloggers was because back then everything I Pinterest had really wide pictures. It was just the thing. So I was in a great spot at a great time because I knew everyone was hiring me to make the long pictures that we see today. We have been using this like two to three ratio for the longest time. And I'm so happy because that day ever comes where they reverse it, we are all in a lot of trouble. We're going to have to definitely outsource that to get all these new pins done. So hopefully that's kind of stay the same for a long time.

[00:12:05.400] - Kristen
Other things with Pin design that are still popular, we still have white space. We still want to see big fonts, Pinterest said, don't use font smaller than like size twenty one because no one's going to be able to read it. If you want to use your logo, make sure it is not like in the bottom corners because those could get cut off if someone's looking at Pinterest like on their phone. So, we want to keep those kind of like in the center of your pin. When it comes to branding, I'm actually like keeping a lot of my pins looking the same. I think if you guys are using a tool like Canva where we can create amazing graphics and templates over and over again, I like keeping mine fairly consistent. And the main reason is when I want to Pinterest I can tell who's pinging what base and what their pins look like. And I'm always excited to see if someone I follow has a new pin because I can tell right away. So, I think it's something like important to be said about being consistent.

[00:13:05.050] - Kristen
Okay, so, yeah, those are my two big tips about that's another thing I want to talk about that I talked about earlier, is promoted pins a little bit more.

[00:13:15.160] - Kristen
So, with everything I just said, all of that is free. All of that is organic growth. I think that is super important. You never know when that pin is going to go viral. So, you need to be working on that all the time. But if you want to kind of like go to the front of the line, you should be doing promoted pins. They are just becoming so popular about two to three years ago now, maybe like two years ago, we couldn't touch promoted Pinterest bloggers.

[00:13:45.370] - Kristen
Pinterest was very serious about if you don't have a ten thousand dollar monthly budget, you cannot do a promoted pin. And it was really frustrating because they only wanted to work with these high level brands. Only in the past couple of years have we been able to do promoted pins with any kind of budget. So I like it because if I want to promote something as a blogger, like maybe I'm promoting a new course or I have a great freebie, I want to get out there because I want to grow my email list or I want to work on like affiliate income promoted pins can be done for as little as like five bucks a day. And we have gotten some amazing results from these five dollar pins. So yeah. So, I want to share some statistics. So if anybody is watching, write this down, because this is some great information. The first one case study we did is we had a client and first of all, promoter pins, you should run them for at least 30 days. It's going to take time to gain traction. It's not like a Facebook ad. If anyone's looked at Facebook ads where you can see results in like 24 hours and, you know, this is working or this isn't working, Pinterest isn't that fast. It's just not designed to be like that.

[00:14:55.840] - Kristen
So, here is a great example of someone of a client who did a 30 day promoted point campaign. And I'm just going to share the first 14 days because it's crazy. So we ran one ad and that means we did like one- we did two different pins we picked from. So our whole type of campaign was just traffic. We just wanted to get traffic back to the client site and we wanted to kind of increase their email list and we wanted to help them make money because they were doing some like affiliate marketing.

[00:15:26.590] - Kristen
So here's what we did. And then 14 days we spent $62.70 cents. We sent them 433 clicks out of that $62 in two weeks. We also got free clicks out of it. And this is something that will show up when you're on your campaign. But basically Pinterest will reward you as you start to get more clicks. So, if you start to get a ton of clicks and it gets saved, other people, audiences from where they've saved that pen will start to see it and click on it and Pinterest will not charge you. So, let's say, Liz, you share one of my pins that I promoted, you save it. You have twenty people that click on it. I'm not going to get charged because you've gone ahead and saved it. So, that's kind of cool. So, you're getting more than like what you're investing, right? So with that hour click through rate, we always want it to be over one percent. Pinterest tells us, "Hey, if you're Pin is getting less than 1%, there's probably something wrong with it."

[00:16:27.970] - Kristen
Change your pin design, change your description. Something's not working. Yeah, so we achieved like a one point three two percent click through rate cost per click. This is the big one. You guys Pinterest is going to ask you to pick your budget. How much do you want to pay per click. Always put in ten cents. It sounds really low but it will even pop up and say, "Yeah, benefits of working from home" For me are so cute.

[00:16:56.980] - Kristen
So, one of the things I love about this is you can override promoted Pin system, right? We're going to put in ten cents. I start every campaign at ten cents from there. You can go ahead and modify it over time. So, like let's say my budget is five dollars a day. I put in ten cents. It's going to be like fifty clicks. Right. I'm horrible at math, but that's like fifty clicks a day. Let's say you're not maxing out your five dollar budget. That just means you need to go back and increase your cost per clicks to like fifteen cents. So, you're just going to raise it a smidgen just to start maxing out your budget to get those click throughs. So here is the results. For 14 days we spent $62.70 cents for one 433 clicks. Their main affiliate that they were talking about in their blog post made $500. They had a second affiliate that was not like it didn't pay out as high. That made a little over $200. And then the other surprise was her email list grew by one third for her often freebie. So, the really cool thing about this is even though when those 14 days, we can't gauge how much she's going to make down the road if she sells a course or if she recommends like an affiliate or something like that. So that's going to come on down the road. But just in those 14 days, totally got the money back.

[00:18:24.170] - Kristen
So, that's like, amazing. Okay, so I think these are like amazing results. So I'm always big on our ROI return on investment. So, if I'm going to spend $62 to go make 500 here, another couple of hundred here, grow my email list by a third -  sign me up for promoted pins all day long. So, that is a great entry level to start. So whether you're a new blogger with just a few blog posts and you really want to start trying or you've been around, go for it.

[00:18:55.460] - Kristen
The other one I want to talk about is the extreme opposite end. This one we did a case study for, I had a client and we did a 30 day campaign. I'm finding it. Okay, this one's a little more wild. We had a $100 budget per day for 30 days, so we would have spent about $3000 on ad spend. We came in just a little bit short of that. Return on investment was 11,200 in affiliate income.

[00:19:27.860] - Kristen
So, they were promoting a higher end product. They gained 4572 email subscribers, not to mention who knows what's going to happen after those 30 days. So, I can't I can't monitor that. I don't know what they're going to get out of it, but that is really crazy to me. So, for $3000 to get the $11,200 of income plus or 4400 subscribers, that blows my mind. So I think that's crazy.

[00:19:59.300] - Kristen
Now, if you're scared to do a campaign, you can hire somebody. Like if you don't have the time, you don't know what you're doing, you can always hire somebody. You can start at the low end of the five dollars a day for your budget. You can increase it gradually to get it up to a hundred dollars. It's up to you what you're trying to promote. I just wanted to show the humongous difference of what promoted pins can do for you.

[00:20:23.210] - Liz
But I wouldn't just, I just want to add, because you point out the ROI, so you want to have some sort of goal on what you're promoting, right? You don't want traffic just for ad revenue because that's not necessarily going to provide the ROI that covers that ad cost. So, an affiliate link, product.

[00:20:38.390] - Kristen
Yeah, although I would say I've talked to a lot of food bloggers and for them their primary source of revenue is ad revenue, which blows my mind because I don't focus on ad revenue at all.

[00:20:51.140] - Liz
So, I think it depends what you're doing. So, some food bloggers have these crazy blog posts where they're especially like quarter four or even Q3. They can make so much money off of ads. Now, for those of us that are personal finance bloggers, we do great and I personally do great in Q1. Yeah, I also have ads. Some ads do horrible because that's when companies have no marketing budgets. So I can't rely on ad revenue. But I know Q1 is a great time to do blog posts that are about, you know, working on my budget for the year, saving money, getting out of debt so you could run a campaign in Q1 that is all about maybe you're selling a budget spreadsheet or one of those really pretty coloring charts, but you color in that help you track debt or pay off debt. So, I think, yeah, like you said, you have to have a goal. Don't just run a campaign, have a goal in mind of what you want to achieve.

[00:21:45.680] - Liz
Yes. I just want to point that out because you don't want to spend money to spend money.

[00:21:52.700] - Kristen
Right. And I think some people do that, like I think one of the red flags I look at as clients is when they come to me and say, "How do I make ten thousand dollars a month?" "How do I get ten thousand new visitors to my site?" "Why am I seeing results after 30 days of Pinterest like it takes time?" Organic is the way to go. Like I said, you've got to do that slow roll and build it up because that's something we're probably going to be using for a long time. Pinterest isn't going anywhere, but you can also be using promoted pins, especially like like you're doing a big launch or you're doing something special. Definitely do promoted pins and it's affordable more so than I think other platforms are.

[00:22:30.120] - Liz
Yeah, no. And I think ads have become much more accessible in general to smaller businesses.

[00:22:36.740] - Kristen
So yeah, I think so too. And I think especially now let's take advantage of that before things change.

[00:22:43.910] - Liz
I even saw- I think I saw an ad about that. Like Hulu you could do for like five hundred dollar budget. If you have a five hundred dollar budget, you could go on Hulu ads.

[00:22:54.230] - Kristen
Oh my gosh. I wonder how that would work.

[00:22:56.300] - Liz
I don't know. I didn't actually look at it, but I found it interesting. And I was like, "I might just go look at that just to see what that is, because that is crazy that's opening up stuff too."

[00:23:05.580] - Kristen
That is interesting or I wonder, like a tick tock, like I've seen ads on tick tock. I wonder how that would work. Yeah, it's interesting, right? I'm so fascinated by how all this stuff works, like on the back end.

[00:23:18.100] - Liz
Yeah. Same. No, I think that was some fantastic information and advice. If you do love Pinterest the way Kristen does and you want to kind of get paid to do it, then I would recommend, of course, personally; it pays for itself with your first client, typically. But yeah. So, I'm just throwing that out there. Is it any final words or something you want to share with them?

[00:23:44.770] - Kristen
Yeah, I think definitely take advantage of Pinterest, you know, it's a lot different than Facebook, it's different than Twitter is different than Instagram. I love Pinterest so much because people can literally click on it and go back to your website. So, if you are nervous about Pinterest, don't be scared to talk to a Pinterest. Don't be scared to have a conversation about hiring somebody. You don't have to hire somebody full time, but you could absolutely talk to someone and say, "Can you just help me get started? Like, what do I need to do?" And there are people out there like our Pinterest VA center say, "Sure, here's what we need to do with your account." Here's your to do list. Go for it." So, I think there's a lot of options out there. Don't be intimidated by working with somebody.

[00:24:27.700] - Liz
Absolutely. All right. And guys, the link is below. If you aren't sure where to get started finding a Pinterest VA, she actually she built this amazing community with her course and she has a Facebook group where they are all located. And you can, like, submit, hey, this is what I'm looking for and get get pitches. So I think the link to that is below. And if you're actually becoming one, there's more information on that page to the right?

[00:24:50.650] - Kristen
Yes that's it. You have two options to take a look at and see if you're interested in either one.

[00:24:56.020] - Liz
Awesome. So, definitely go check that out. Guys that Facebook group has a lot of great Pinterest feeds in it. Like, truly, you will get some amazing pitches from them if you're looking to hire. So, so.

[00:25:08.440] - Kristen
Well, thanks so much for having me. This was super fun. Get it.

[00:25:12.580] - Liz
Get going on Pinterest guys do some promoted pins.
