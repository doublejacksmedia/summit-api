Hi and welcome. I'm Jessica Evans, owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, and I'm thrilled to have you here for this presentation. I'm going to walk you through today my top five tips to increase your conversions now. Let's get started. Okay, a little bit about me.

[00:00:28.920] - Jessica
Now. I am not only the owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, but I'm also a wife, a mother, baker, and obsessed crafter, and also working on my organization skills. That will probably be something I do forever. Little ADHD here, so can't help myself. I've got two girls, 14 and 9, and they are growing so fast and keeping me on my toes every step of the way.

[00:00:51.470] - Jessica
I call Michigan home, and I've been here my entire life, and I will probably remain here. I love Michigan. I have to be near water. We love boating and camping, and both are wonderful things to do here in the Mitten State.

[00:01:07.350] - Jessica
So, today what you're going to learn why affiliate marketing is so powerful and how to be successful at it. Again, I'm going to share my top five tips so you can increase your conversions now. Why should you take my advice? Well, let me give you some background. As I mentioned before, I'm the owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, but I was a successful blogger first.

[00:01:32.590] - Jessica
I created my first blog in 2015, and that was Follow My Arrow. It's still around. It's just not as active these days. I'm a little busy on the side. I also became an affiliate for UB, and that was my highest paying program to date.

[00:01:52.290] - Jessica
I joined the UB team as a member of the Customer Happiness Team in 2017. Because I loved the products and the team, it just made it such an easy job to do.

[00:02:05.030] - Jessica
I became the manager of Customer Happiness here at UB in 2018, and that was such an honor. I submitted my first product to the master. Your Money super bundle in 2019. That was my first step to commit to my blog, so I was really committed to making money at that point. I wanted to make it more than a hobby, but something that I could do for life, honestly.

[00:02:29.710] - Jessica
So, my blog monthly earnings grew to five figures in 2021. It took time, definitely, was not overnight, but I believe that sustainable growth takes time. Then this year, 2022, my most exciting decision yet, I purchased UB. That has been an adventure so far, and I can't wait to see where it takes us next.

[00:02:55.290] - Jessica
So, let's get started with the presentation. Okay, tip five. Keep your list warm. Why? Well, you want everyone to have you at the top of mind, right?

[00:03:09.300] - Jessica
So, don't disappear between promotions. You can't just sell. You have to offer valuable content at all times, honestly. You can use newsletters. Coffee chats. I love coffee chats. Those are my favorite newsletters styles to send. Blog post roundups are great as well. And free resources in between promotions, by far the best way to keep your audience warm. Now remember that you want your brand, like I said, to stay in the front of everyone's mind.

[00:03:41.270] - Jessica
So, you have to show up. You've got to be there. You want to be seen as trustworthy, resourceful, helpful. Don't ghost them. Instead, be their go-to for whatever niche you're in.

[00:03:52.410] - Jessica
Be consistent. So, it's definitely not enough just to be showing up. If you're not consistent, they're not going to know when to expect your messages. If you send on a whim, you won't build any authority. Tip four, write a blog post.

[00:04:11.420] - Jessica
Okay, this is an easy one. If you're going to promote something, write a blog post. Share the nitty gritty. You can't do that in email, right? That would make for a really long email message and no one's going to read that.

[00:04:25.010] - Jessica
You can get into the details. You could even do a review on whatever it is that you're trying to promote. Now for bundles, because I've done this so often and I'm also here owning the company, reviewing our bundles is an awesome way to do it. You can make this almost evergreen. If you do so, link everything.

[00:04:48.990] - Jessica
That means make it so easy for anyone to click and find more about whatever it is that you're promoting. I'm talking the logo, okay? Anything with brand on it, anywhere that says, any messaging that is relevant. Make it hyperlinked. Just make it ridiculous easy, ridiculously easy to purchase the product.

[00:05:15.250] - Jessica
Okay? Question for you. How large is your following? Who do we have here? Send it and let's share it in chat.

[00:05:22.610] - Jessica
Are you a guppy? Are you under like 100,000, or I'm sorry, a 1000. Tuna, 10,000 or less. Shark, 25,000 or more? Whale, 50,000.

[00:05:36.830] - Jessica
Where are you? I'd love to see. So share it, please.

[00:05:42.190] - Jessica
Okay, on to the next tip. Tip three. Utilize Pinterest. Pinterest is amazing. It's my go-to.

[00:05:49.400] - Jessica
It doesn't matter if you're going to promote it. It doesn't matter what you're going to do. Pin your darn post. It's [inaudible 00:05:54]  search engine. You want people to find you, so you don't need just Google.

[00:05:59.110] - Jessica
Pinterest is great too.

[00:06:02.770] - Jessica
Promote your pin. If you really, really want to get serious, promote your pin. It's a great way to get the momentum going and it's a great way to keep it going. So, I've had a few pins, especially seasonal, that have done fabulous, and they do this year after year. One in particular is a scavenger hunt, and it's for Easter. I get thousands of email subscribers every March and April, thousands from one pin.

[00:06:32.630] - Jessica
And it was just a scavenger hunt that I did with my girls. Decided to write about it, make it a printable, and boom, I've grown my list. Now, a couple of things here. There's a few options depending on your list size, because your email size does not necessarily matter for affiliate promotions, as long as they're active and as long as they see you as authority and trustworthy, you're pretty good. So, when it comes to Pinterest, let Pinterest find your ideal audience.

[00:07:05.340] - Jessica
If you're going to go ahead and promote a Pin. And you're not sure of your audience, you have a small audience already, let Pinterest find your ideal audience. You could also create a lookalike. Now this I would suggest for somebody that has at least, probably, 3000 email subscribers. And you can actually take your list and have that be created using your lookalike.

[00:07:33.730] - Jessica
Select the demographics of your ideal person. That's great for someone that has nothing. And it's a really fun way to try to corner where your people are. You have to know a lot about your audience. You have to know what they like, where they shop, what they do in order for this to work.

[00:07:52.410] - Jessica
But it's a great tool as well. All right, tip number two. We're getting really close to my number one tip, but tip number two, this is super important. Promote the prelaunch. When you're doing any type of promotion, the prelaunch is essentially a warm up for your audience.

[00:08:12.350] - Jessica
They are usually offering a free item. So, whether it's an ebook maybe, or maybe like an email challenge, there's so many different things, a webinar, all these things. It's a great way to introduce your audience to the brand. And plus, okay, this is a real great part. You get those cookies.

[00:08:39.110] - Jessica
So, if you're an affiliate, you're going to be cookied. So, basically, you're tracked. All these folks that you're sending, they will be tracked to your affiliate ID. Those will continue on through the sale. 

[00:08:54.190] - Jessica
So, you're really just getting more traffic tagged to you to your affiliate ID in order to earn more money later. And a real big bonus to this, you're going to get extra attention for your audience. Why? Because you're going to have more help with your promotion. While those folks are on the email list of the company that you are promoting, they're also going to be promoting the product.

[00:09:21.520] - Jessica
So, you're going to have yours that go out to them. You're going to have the company that you're promoting going out to them. And it's a great way to keep this item top of mind. It's free promotion for you. You still earn money from the sales.

[00:09:37.130] - Jessica
That's not going to change, but you're getting the extra help from the actual company that's promoting. Okay, another question. What is your biggest fear when it comes to emailing? Now drop this in chat because I'd love to hear. Are you afraid of unsubscribes? Are you afraid of just emailing too much?

[00:09:57.070] - Jessica
What is your biggest fear? All right, so this one, as you can guess, is all about your inbox emailing. Okay? Tip one, show up in their inbox.

[00:10:10.620] - Jessica
This is so important. If you don't show up in their inbox, they don't know you, they won't remember you. They're not going to be able to purchase anything from you. What I suggest, email daily minimum. I can't stress this one enough, honestly. You can't share your knowledge if you don't email.

[00:10:28.410] - Jessica
Not every email will be opened by every subscriber to the likelihood of anyone being overwhelmed or having that spammy feeling from your messages. Slim to none. Share a story with each email. So, don't just come out with a hard sell. Share a story.

[00:10:45.730] - Jessica
Something personal. It doesn't have to be long, just short and sweet, but something to make you feel human. Use the resources provided. Now this, this is gold. When you're promoting, you're going to have assets available to you.

[00:11:01.700] - Jessica
You'll have a promotion schedule which will probably give you exactly what you should be doing as far as email, social media, any of that. You'll also have graphics and swipe. Utilize it. It's great to get going.

[00:11:17.110] - Jessica
Now, one of the things that you want to do in order to make sure you don't get a high number of unsubscribes is to have an opt out. But not just one as an unsubscribe that's standard in an email. You want one specifically for this promotion. Allow them to opt out very easily to the promotion.

[00:11:37.690] - Jessica
That way you don't lose them from your list, but you also don't overwhelm them with something they have no interest in. It's really, really easy. Just add that top, middle to somewhere on your email, and it will allow you to keep those subscribers that still love you, just don't love the offer. Remember, unsubscribes are good. This is a huge reminder for everyone.

[00:12:03.910] - Jessica
You don't want those folks that have no interest in what you are offering on your list. You're paying for them to do nothing, paying for them just to sit there, bring down your stats. You don't want that. So every time you email, you are essentially pruning your list, right? Makes sense.

[00:12:23.870] - Jessica
You want to only reach those that are truly your people. Okay, quick recap.

[00:12:32.510] - Jessica
First thing is first, keep your list warm. What do you do next? Write a blog post. Number three. Utilize pinterest.

[00:12:41.790] - Jessica
And then of course, promote the prelaunch. And finally, just keep showing up in their inbox. I'm telling you, these things will change your conversions and change them now. Doesn't matter what size your list is, it does not matter. Your following can be small or large.

[00:13:32.450] - Jessica
Now, we have paid out over $10 million in commissions to our contributors and affiliates over the past ten years. That's wild. I still can't believe that number. It's just so large. Okay, why should you do this?
