Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining me. Welcome to the Bloggers Summit. I know you're having a wonderful time. I know you're learning a lot. I know that it's been very inspirational. It's very inspirational and motivational for you. My name is Cynthia. And the topic that I'm going to be speaking on today is developing your mindset for success.

[00:00:36.800] - Cynthia
In anything that we're doing. The first person we have to have on board is ourselves. We have to be able to recognize things that help us and things that actually don't help us. And where it all starts is in the mind. So that's what I'm going to be talking about today on how to develop that mindset for success on how you can build the life and dreams that you are desiring. Yes, it is possible.

[00:01:06.080] - Cynthia
So, I know you might be thinking, you know, how do I do it? Where do I start? What is going on? A lot of times we go through life- maybe you were in corporate and after some time you realized that you weren't being fulfilled there. You had a bigger calling, that you wanted to serve people, that you wanted to be your own boss. And you start out and then life happens. Maybe you lose part of your confidence and you just start to wonder, what am I doing? Is this for me? And so that's the part where I come in. I help to encourage you that if you were able to think about it, if you created it in your head, then yes, you can create it in reality as well. And it all starts with just one basic step. And that is envisioning that is believing what you have thought about, that it is going to come true. And believe me, without wavering, believe me, knowing that this is the truth, this is what I'm going to do. And then you take those steps and you set out to do it.

[00:02:15.020] - Cynthia
A little bit. Again, my name is Cynthia Jones. A little bit about me. I am a business and mindset coach. How I started actually is, you know, like everyone else, we all start from somewhere. I was in cybersecurity. I was a cybersecurity analyst. I was in the IT field for over ten years. And what happened is that when I started, I thought, "I'm going to do cyber security." Actually no. I said, "I'm going to do IT" because back then it was just called information technology. I didn't have anything around me showing me IT. I didn't know anyone in IT. But I had this dream that I would become IT professional. I had created in my mind that it would be better for me and my family if I did IT. So, yeah. So I just started with that dream in my head and I just dug into it and I would not let anything stop me.

[00:03:17.210] - Cynthia
So, when I started, I wanted to be a system administrator. I thought this would be great if I could do this, if I could accomplish this goal. And I started out and I realized that system administrator was going to be very difficult for me as a woman, as a you know, as you can see, a colored woman. And I thought, what else could I do? And I back then was called information assurance. I said, "Well, what about this new field called Information Assurance. Surely I can do that. And I started and I dug in. I got a master's, actually two masters, and I became this wonderful cybersecurity professional.

[00:03:58.790] - Cynthia
And along the way, after I had accomplished all these great goals, I realized that that was not my true calling, that something else was my true calling, which is serving people, which is helping other entrepreneurial women grow into the dreams and desires that they have. Some desires might be blogging, for others it might be coaching. It could be an array of things. But the one underlying theme that everyone shares is that you have a story, you have a message that you are ready to give to the world. And I believe that we all have that. We all have that message, that unique voice inside of us that the world is waiting to hear. It doesn't matter if there is one thousand bloggers or one thousand coaches. What is important is that your take, your voice is heard because there's an audience waiting for you.

[00:04:59.480] - Cynthia
So, that's what I do. I help women mostly achieve these really, really big goals.

[00:05:10.250] - Cynthia
So, how do I do this process? Well, the way that I have developed my process is actually I have to develop it first with myself is that you create the vision, then you begin to set effective goals and then you begin, then that will lead you to the steps to design the life that you have been dreaming of. And everyone is different. Some inspire to be a teacher, some inspire to be an entrepreneur. Some inspired to be a stay-at-home-mom. You know, some inspire to be just an online business. So, it doesn't matter what the inspiration is, but what matters is that you're taking steps to fulfill it because it's a long is that desire is not being fulfilled, you will always feel like something is missing.

[00:06:00.560] - Cynthia
So, what is the vision? How do you develop this vision is really, really important, because if you don't have the vision right, then you're not going to be able to navigate into the path that you want to go.

[00:06:16.100] - Cynthia
So a couple of things that I would like to go over is here's what you need to know. What we have been taught about vision, and it's closely related to dreaming is really false because I'm sure you heard, you know, you can't be a dreamer. You can't sit around and dream all day. Nothing's going to happen if you're dreaming. That's actually false. We do need to dream. We do need to dig inside of what we have to give, because what I have to give and what you have to give is uniquely different.

[00:06:46.730] - Cynthia
So, it's not the same because I'm Cynthia and you're Stephanie or Marie or, you know, whatever your name is, you are you and so is uniquely different. Different. It may look like the same, but it's not. And it's the best thing you can do. The best way you can grow your life is by starting with the dream.

[00:07:09.230] - Cynthia
Once we have that dream vision, we begin to create the goals to move towards that desire we are seeking to fulfill.

[00:07:19.880] - Cynthia
And again, what you are desiring is very important. It's what you are meant to do. So, don't take it lightly. Don't take it as it's something that can't be accomplished. Sometimes it's really huge. It scares you. It's okay, you can do it. We always create everything twice. We create it once in the mental, in our head, in our minds, and then we create it again in the physical. But nothing is created until we create it first in our mental. That's why vision and dreaming is so important. And the other thing that it will do is it will take you out of your comfort zone. A lot of times people are comfortable in being comfortable. And I like to say, "You need to get comfortable in being uncomfortable." That's where you're your big aspirations are. That's where your big inspirations are in that uncomfortable ability, if you know what I mean. You know, you're not going to be comfortable starting your own blog. You're not going to be comfortable starting your own coaching business. Why? Because it's something you haven't done before. It's something you don't know what it looks like. It's something that you're envisioning, but you haven't quite seen it. So, you just keep envisioning it until you see it. That's just the way it is. It's something that you're just expiring for and you're thinking, "How is it all going to work?" But trust in the process, it will work out. So, my encouragement is that whatever it is that you are desiring to do, believe that it will happen. It will happen.

[00:09:06.290] - Cynthia
As I was saying before, the art of seeing vision is the art of seeing what is invisible. We create everything twice. We do. We create everything twice. The vision is so important. The dreaming is so important because without it you can't create. You're like a ship with no destination. You know, you have to embrace those visions. You have to embrace those dreams. As big as and scary as they may seem, maybe they're not aligned with what you're doing. Maybe right now you are working a nine to five, but you're being pulled to start your own business. And you're thinking, "How do I do this?" Once you believe that it will be done? You don't have to worry about the how. You will get the inspiration and the steps and the ways to move- you will you just have to believe that it's going to happen for you.

[00:10:00.790] - Cynthia
So, I have a quick story about us. I've been listening to this gentleman, Earl Nightindale, and he gave a story of one hundred men who started out even at the age of 25. And they all believe they were going to be successful. They all started on the same playing field, per say, and by the time they were 65, only one had became rich, four had became financially independent, five were still working and fifty four were broke.

[00:10:36.940] - Cynthia
So, why was there such a large gap? Because the one that was rich and the ones, the four that were financially independent, they had captured that vision of being rich. If you are desiring to be rich first, you have to believe you have to grab a hold of that vision. I'm going to be rich. I'm going to be successful. And you don't compare your success to other people. Your success is independent of you.

[00:11:09.240] - Cynthia
How you're going to start, I keep saying blogging because we're having the Blogging Summit, but how you are going to start your blogging business is different than every other person. Yes, there are the steps that tells you, you know, get your domain, get your website, you know, put your plug in and start writing things like that. Yes. Those things are there. That's an outline. But your particular steps, you have to be able to envision how that's going to work. And then you believe in it, and then you begin to move towards those steps. Vision is very important in building your business, your life, anything is very important. Vision will take you places that you were dreaming of, truly.

[00:12:00.590] - Cynthia
The next one is a goal setting, so another thing that separated the 100 men from the rich in the financially independent other ones was goals. So, after they determined, they decided I'm going to be rich, they begin to map that out. What is the vehicle that takes you to your success? To that successful blogging that has one hundred and twenty unique views? What is the the steps or the plan that takes you there? Well, it begins with a plan and goal.

[00:12:39.740] - Cynthia
Goals. I believe that, you know, once you have those goals, first you develop the plan, then you develop the goals around the plan. So, it's the vision, the plan and the goals. And you move towards these things.

[00:12:58.920] - Cynthia
Another example is say that let's say you want to become a successful blogger or coach and you just start, you say, "Okay, I'm going to start this blogging business or I'm going to start this coaching business. Let me get going. I'm going to build a website. I'm going to start speaking on Podcast. I'm going to create a blog to go on my website. I'm going to start speaking to people about it and all these things." And you just start doing 101 things. And then a year later, you find yourself doing 101 things. Why? Because you're just like on a hamster wheel. You did not create a plan with goals.

[00:13:39.150] - Cynthia
So, the first thing that if you want to be- and a lot of times people- I'm sorry, a lot of times people think it doesn't work, but it is the step by step, the mundane things, mundane things that take you to success. That is your vehicle to success. So, we would have been better to say, "Okay, I'm going to start my website and I'm going to either you're going to start a personal website or maybe just start a blog website. But either or- I'm going to start it. And then the first thing I'm going to do is start generating traffic to that website. How do I do that? Okay, I need to I want organic traffic or am I going to use paid, what am I going to write about? How am I going to when I'm posting on social media, it would be to drive traffic to my website." And that is the first plan you start with.

[00:14:31.490] - Cynthia
Maybe your second plan is your social media. Maybe your third plan is your speaking engagements. But until you get the idea, the thing about it is that you start it with a plan. And you develop goals to move you towards the success you are looking for.

[00:14:52.850] - Cynthia
So, I think I've gone over this enough that provisions are important. They're very important and, you know, it's good to write them down. It's good to create them without boundaries. It's good to just really allow yourself to dream of the life you are desiring and how you're going to create it. Goals when you're having your goals. Don't play small. Don't hold yourself back. Really engage in what you are doing and believe, believe, believe. It doesn't matter what's happening around you, doesn't matter what things look like. Don't give up hope. Hope takes you a long way. It really does.

[00:15:37.210] - Cynthia
So, you have goals and you have visions. They do help change your life, your family, your career. So, it's very important that you hold on to those things. So, as we're coming to a close, let's think about it. It's your dream vision. Dream big, vision huge when you're doing it, don't put boundaries on yourself, don't say in the past "I wasn't successful." "How am I going to get the money,?" Let all of the constraints go and dream big. Once you have the dream, begin to develop the plan to get to the dream, which is one aspect of this dream that you're going to dig into and make it successful. Once you've done that, then how am I going to do that with goals? So, I'm going to set up goals around my vision and plan. And I ensure you, you will be very successful.

[00:16:39.010] - Cynthia
Another quick statistics on planning and goal setting. This one's was from Harvard study, and it was a single question is what was their goals in life? And have you written these goals down and created a plan to attain them? 84% had not written down their goals and 13% had and they were very successful. So, again, just imagine- just imagine what life you are desiring and then start to make the plan to achieve this life.

[00:17:19.540] - Cynthia
I know sometimes it's scary. I know sometimes it's hard. I know sometimes life gets difficult. But don't give up that dream or that plan or those goals to attain it. It may seem like it's not going to happen, but in due time it will happen if you don't lose hope and you don't lose the desire because we all move towards the things that we desire.

[00:17:52.950] - Cynthia
So, that's basically it. I hope that you enjoy the talk. I hope you enjoy the rest of the speakers that are coming. I hope that, you know, you begin to design the life you are desiring. I hope and I believe that you will create, you know, the blogging website and it will be very successful. You will put the time and effort in to make it successful. Nothing is successful with wishing and and sitting down. But things are a success because you do. And I believe that with the tips that we're giving you, the encouragement that we're giving you, you will be able to do just that.
