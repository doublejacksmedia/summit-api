Hello and welcome to this session on how to use batch planning to get your content completed faster. I'm Cara Harvey, and we are going to dive into a way that I hope will help you be working smarter and not harder. I know what it's like to try to get your blog, your website, your business up and running and feel like you're spinning your wheels trying to do everything. And this batch method I'm going to teach you today I think is going to be your shortcut to success when you have a million things on your plate as a business owner. Before I jump in, I'm going to let you know something.

[00:00:42.120] - Cara
I talk fast, so if you want to get a replay, pause, however, you want to do that to hang out with me today, make sure you access that pass because I'm going to throw a lot of information at you and I want to make sure that you leave with tons of value. But, yeah, I talk pretty fast and I want to make sure we get through it all. So, there's your warning. Let's dive in. We are going to cover a bunch of stuff today.

[00:01:03.700] - Cara
First, we're going to talk about how a batch system works and how to start creating it. We're also going to talk about why you need this to figure out what to work on when and decrease the overwhelm. I'm going to show you how mapping out a content plan is going to help you easily batch all of your tasks. A blog, a YouTube, a podcast, whatever you want to do, and how to start delegating and asking for help to make this work too. So, if this sounds like you, I want to let you know this is the session you need to be watching today.

[00:01:33.270] - Cara
Right? Do you ever say these things? I sit down to work and I just do not know what to do or my life is so busy, how am I supposed to find the time to get it done? Or maybe this one. I feel like I'm busy, but I'm not getting anything actually accomplished.

[00:01:46.870] - Cara
You ever get to the end of the day and you just throw your hands up? Like, what are we even doing? Maybe you said, I want to work on my business, I want to make progress in my home, but I'm just overwhelmed and everything is a struggle. I work from home. I have three kids.

[00:01:58.840] - Cara
My kids are goodness. Six, no, five, seven and 16. And I also know what it's like to try to manage all the things while the dishes are staring at me in the other room and the laundry is begging to be folded. Maybe you're asking yourself, how am I supposed to find time to work when everything else is loaded on your plate? Or you just want to give up and you don't feel like you can make this business work.

[00:02:19.200] - Cara
If you've ever said or recently said any of those things. Friend, I'm happy you're here to hang out with me because I'm Cara Harvey and I help overwhelmed. Specifically, I work with work-at-home moms, but anybody can take my tips. But I help overwhelm work-at-home moms find the time and make action plans to grow and scale their business without hustle, without shame and without overwhelm.

[00:02:39.630] - Cara
I'm going to clip notes my story because, honestly, you're not here to learn about me. But I want you to know that I've been there. I've been in your shoes and I completely understand what it's like. I started my business a little over five years ago as an accidental entrepreneur, and I threw the proverbial spaghetti at a wall trying to figure out what the heck to do. And it wasn't until I niche into productivity and I found my secret sauce in this, what we call priority based productivity and this anti-shame based approach to productivity.

[00:03:07.470] - Cara
Because everything out there is like hustle culture. If you don't want it bad enough, you got to try, sacrifice your sleep, blah, blah, garbage. I decided to do something that was the opposite of that. And when I found that and I started to use my own systems, things took off for me. I was able to go from barely making any money, trying to figure out how to run a business to someone who now has a team of seven.

[00:03:28.000] - Cara
I run a rated top 100 podcast called The Purpose Driven Mom Show with over 380,000 downloads and counting. And I'm the author of the book the 15 Minutes Formula how busy mom can ditch the guilt, say yes to what matters and conquer their goals. And I was able to do both of these things and help over 3000 women in my program by using the system I'm going to talk to you about today. So, whether you're just starting out or you're looking to amplify your currently growing business, I hope you can gleam some nuggets that you can take with you. Now, on a scale of one to ten, I want you to think about this.

[00:04:00.600] - Cara
How efficient would you say you are right now with managing your time and managing your business? Are you a one, hot mess? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just getting started and I feel like I sit down and have zero clue what to do. Are you a ten?

[00:04:13.690] - Cara
Like carrot? Get out the seat. Let me teach this class, right? Or are you like a five? Like, some days, it works, some days, it doesn't, help me out.

[00:04:21.880] - Cara
I want you to think about this because my goal for you is to be able to take it a step further. My goal for you is to be able to say, this is where I'm at. And now I've got some systems and tips because I'm going to toss a lot at you today that I can take and I can amplify it a little bit. So let's talk about the pillars of batching. Our first pillar is about premapping a content plan.

[00:04:41.910] - Cara
We're going to talk about that. We're then going to talk about how to categorize your tasks to make you, again, work smarter, not harder. We're going to talk about creating time blocks and how you're going to work ahead. And pre planning key here, pre planning things out. So, when it's time to actually sit at your desk or your standing treadmill or your kitchen table or your bedroom or wherever you're working at the moment, you know what to do.

[00:05:03.960] - Cara
And you're not sitting there wasting the time thinking, what am I supposed to be doing? Does that ever happen to you? You're like, yes, my kid's napping, I've got an hour. What the heck am I supposed to be doing? Because everything feels urgent, we are going to answer all those questions.

[00:05:18.090] - Cara
So, let's start with pillar one, premapping a content plan. I highly encourage you to make a content plan for your pillar content. And when I'm talking about pillar content, this could be a blog, it could be a podcast, it could be a YouTube channel. What is your main way that you're providing value, bringing it out to the people and the people are finding you, whatever that is, you want to have a content plan.

[00:05:39.750] - Cara
Content planning is going to help you be more focused on what you're doing and why. It's also going to help you fill in gaps with your batching because what it's allowing you to do is look at the vision. And I know it can feel scary and hard to look 5, 12, 14 weeks into the future, but I promise you when you start to get this method going, you save so much time. This is going to help you create your schedules based on the next four to twelve weeks. If you don't know where you're going, then it's very hard to make an action plan around your work.

[00:06:10.740] - Cara
So, I actually want to show you yeah, I'm going to show you this, but I'm going to show you a blank one in a second. Actually, let's start with a blank one. Hold on, I think I have a copy of it here. Yes. Perfect.

[00:06:19.620] - Cara
And I'm going to send these over, so you can access this as well. This is my blanket content mapping schedule. And what I do at the start of the quarter is, or not the start of the quarter, maybe a couple of weeks before the quarter begins because I want to get ahead is I sit down and I ask myself, what am I promoting and when? The first thing you're going to want to do here is fill in the weeks, like week of, you know, like 1/1/2023, whatever you want to do. You're going to put the week here.

[00:06:44.970] - Cara
You're then going to fill all the weeks and you're going to work vertically and not horizontally. We want to fill it horizontally because that makes sense, right? I should just fill in the whole list for the week. Friend I want you to go vertically because that's how our brains work better. And what you're going to do is you're going to say like, okay, so January 1, January 8.

[00:07:05.160] - Cara
I don't have a calendar in front of me, so I don't actually know when the weeks start. But you're going to go vertically. Okay. Batch those out. Cool.

[00:07:11.220] - Cara
Pat yourself in the back. You got your twelve weeks listed. What you're then going to do is go to the next column. Then you're going to ask yourself what are promotions or launches happening then? So, maybe there's a summit you're speaking out. Maybe you're launching your product. Maybe you have a freebie you want to push or an ebook or something that's a flash sale, an affiliate promotion. You're going to fill what that is in first and again, work up and down, work vertically. And I want you to think about the next twelve weeks.

[00:07:37.210] - Cara
And you don't have to fill it in. This isn't one of those where you have to fill every box in. But if you have a promotion or a launch, you want it. Why? Because you've got to work backwards to make a content plan.

[00:07:47.310] - Cara
So, you're going to go ahead and go this way and you're going to say like, I've got a launch here and maybe in this week, I've got this affiliate promo or whatever it is. So, you have the information. The next column, again, vertical, not horizontal, you're going to work on is the freebie push. So, is there a freebie that you're going to focus on sending people to that fits in with your launch? So, if I'm launching something, I work on time management for work at home moms, right?

[00:08:10.650] - Cara
So, maybe I'm launching my membership, the purpose of a mom club. So, if I know that that's happening, I might be pushing like six weeks before that, eight weeks before that, I'm pushing people to my freebie. So, I'm going to say, what's a freebie that sets people up for success when it comes to my program? And I'm going to write the freebie.

[00:08:26.920] - Cara
And so I've got a weekly checklist here. Maybe I have a social media planner that fits really nicely here with my affiliate promotion. Because you always want to be growing your email list. Okay. Now I think if you put on a 15 minutes timer, you can potentially get these four even.

[00:08:44.610] - Cara
I'll talk about in a second, columns done in 15 minutes. And you can have your twelve weeks planned. I use a 15 minutes concept because sometimes that's all we have. But our brains can do a lot in 15 minutes and we play beat the clock. So, then you're going to fill your theme.

[00:08:57.220] - Cara
This is like, say I'm doing an affiliate promotion and it's on like reels or something. Maybe it's somebody else is sharing a reels mini course that aligns for my audience. Cool. So, I'm going to push my social media planner because that fits. And my theme this week might be like Instagram, I don't know, content. So, then all the things I'm going to do are going to align around instagram content that fit my niche. So, I'm going to come up with my themes again vertically. Once you've done that first part, take a break, walk away, take a step, come back. And then you're going to start working vertically again.

[00:09:30.240] - Cara
And fill the other columns out. Now across the top. This is my suggested framework. You don't have to use it. Mondays to do a Facebook Live. Tuesdays, maybe send a newsletter.

[00:09:39.820] - Cara
Wednesdays, a post on social media. It's like a value post. Thursdays my podcast comes out. Friday is a personal post on social media. Saturday is a value based post and Sunday is a blog post.

[00:09:49.680] - Cara
Alright, change it up however you want. Come up with what you're going to do every day. And the end goal is, how do I get it to all lead into my launch? How do I get it to all lead into what I'm trying to sell? Because you're trying to make some money.

[00:10:02.880] - Cara
So, what you're going to do then is work vertically. I know I keep saying it because it will make more sense. So, if I'm sitting here and I'm like, cool, I'm going to do some Facebook lives. I have all my themes identified. My brain can easily bang out a whole bunch of twelve ideas on what I could do for Facebook lives, right?

[00:10:20.950] - Cara
I could just say, oh cool, I'm doing it, work at home mom time management tips is what I teach, right? So I could talk about content planning, I could talk about batching. I could do a live on tips for working from home when your kids are sick. My brain will likes that.

[00:10:33.900] - Cara
Then you move to the next column. In the next column, if you put a 15 minutes timer on maybe three blocks, you could probably do this whole first section in 15 minutes. You probably do the second section in 15 minutes. And this third section, that's 45 minutes. And you can get twelve weeks planned out.

[00:10:48.880] - Cara
Doesn't that feel amazing? So, this is what it looks like and it's kind of all completed. You can see here, I've got the weeks here. I've got what my promo is, what my freebie is, my theme. Now this theme I will say this screenshot is from when I was a lifestyle blogger.

[00:11:02.920] - Cara
I don't recommend doing that like super niche down friends. But this is when I had so many things I was talking about. But this is what it looked like in the beginning. So, it might look like that for you. I have my lives planned out, my value posts.

[00:11:16.630] - Cara
I even had a blog post connected to the social media. So, I linked that here to make it easy what everything was. And having this allowed me to batch ahead because I knew where I was going. I knew what the next couple of weeks were going to look like and I knew this is the stuff I needed to create. In less than an hour, you can make a content plan for your next twelve weeks. I promise you. You are very capable of doing it. But you want to work vertically. Okay, that's going to be cute.

[00:11:44.230] - Cara
And I'll make sure I send this link over if you want to get access to that blank planner I have. But you can use anything. Now that is step one. Content plan. Content plan.

[00:11:52.620] - Cara
Content plan. All right, take a breath, right? You can do it. Now let's move to the second step. Now we're going to talk about how to create your batch categories.

[00:12:00.570] - Cara
Now batching is essentially doing similar tasks together, right? It's taking those things, putting them together, so that you don't have to have a million tabs up. If I'm making images in Canva, it does not make sense for me to be like, cool, I'm gonna work on one podcast episode. So, let me pull up one image in Canva and then tomorrow let me pull up Canva again for my one image. Our brains don't want to work like that.

[00:12:22.230] - Cara
When you can batch, you can make a template. You can do it so much faster. So, two ways to batch is either by the task images or by the content pillar, YouTube. So if like, for example, I have a podcast day, that's my one batch day. So on that day, all I work on is podcast stuff.

[00:12:39.610] - Cara
Typically, for my podcast now I just record. I have a team that does a lot of the other stuff, but I still need to outline and plan. So, the way I structure it is I have, it's kind of meta, right? But on Wednesdays it's podcast day. I have opened my schedule from twelve to three for interviews.

[00:12:58.710] - Cara
Okay? So that's like where I interview people or I record podcasts or I get interviewed. Like that's my one time. So, from nine to twelve, which is my first time block, that's when I start batching by task. So I will spend some time from nine to twelve outlining episodes, I will outline all twelve weeks, for example, or all four weeks.

[00:13:21.540] - Cara
I also spend that time maybe reviewing data. I might spend that time I don't make my images now. But you could spend that time making your images. You could spend that time editing. So, I kind of batch inside of a batch.

[00:13:31.780] - Cara
Super meta, super fun. But it's essentially grouping your tasks together. All right, so here's an example of how to make batch categories if you used a blog. I want you to make a list of everything you do in your business and all the tasks it takes to get them done. I'm going to show you an example on Trello in a minute.

[00:13:48.180] - Cara
Trello is a free tool. I will give you this Trello board as well if you want me to do some of the thinking for you. But I want you to go ahead and say, hey, what is my content pillar blog post? What are all the things that has to happen for me to get it done? This is how you start to learn how to create your batches.

[00:14:03.270] - Cara
So, you got to do your SEO and you got to outline, you got to find affiliates, imaging, formatting, writing, the email, social media, write it all down first because when you write it down, you're going to use this data to create a schedule. So, this is a Trello board here. I'm going to give you this where I've done the work for you. But I wanted to teach off Trello for this session in case you were like, Trello's scary, it's fun. This is a really great way to plan.

[00:14:26.040] - Cara
So, here is my blog flow, right? I have exactly what has to happen if I have a podcast. This is everything that has to happen to put one podcast out. Everything that has to happen for social media, everything for images, emails. I have a list here for YouTube and you can keep going, right?

[00:14:43.630] - Cara
There's admin work, creation, research, Twitter, coaching. I don't know, there's tons of stuff you do. Make a list for everything you do and have a big list, so that we can then categorize. But the first thing is, now that I know my content plan, I know I'm going to do YouTube, I know I'm going to do podcast, I know I'm going to do social media, social media. Then all I have to do is say what has to happen to make it go from idea to finished.

[00:15:09.490] - Cara
Now, here's the thing I also want you to do. I want you to start broad, but I want you to then get specific. So, don't write down in your batch plan, outline all blog posts. All right? So, step one, I guess two point A is these big posts here, this like images, opt-ins videos, right?

[00:15:34.180] - Cara
That's kind of step one. That's your general batching. But the second thing that you're going to need to do if you are looking at the next four to twelve weeks and you're trying to get ahead, is I want you to be super specific.

[00:15:49.240] - Cara
Hold on, I had it in one of these cards here I wanted to pull up for you.

[00:15:54.560] - Cara
Oh, here we go. So that's over here. So, for example, what you're going to do is you're not going to write a newsletter. You're going to say newsletter January week one, newsletter January week two, newsletter January week three. Be very specific about what has to happen.

[00:16:11.820] - Cara
And because you've made your beautiful content plan, you already know what it is. All right? And I'm going to show you the rest of these later. So, here's an example here. So, for your membership.

[00:16:22.840] - Cara
You're not going to say, oh, I'm going to work on everything for my membership. I need to film these videos. I need to go live in the group. What does that actually look like? Be very specific because this will be overwhelming proof.

[00:16:34.500] - Cara
When you go to sit down to work, you can be like, oh, I know exactly what I have to do, because it's not that I have to do every blog post if I have to outline this one blog post. All right. So, you're going to batch out and start with your main list of the tasks you want to do. And then we'll get even more specific. Now, when you're ready to plan your time blocks, like I mentioned, I have a podcast day, etc. There's a couple of things I suggest you do.

[00:16:58.740] - Cara
One is start with the time inventory. This is where you're going to write down everything. Everything that you get done, how long it takes. This is because we either over or underestimate how long something is going to take. And what I recommend that you do is you take three to five days, typical days for you, and you can guesstimate.

[00:17:16.080] - Cara
You can use a piece of paper, your phone app. I'm going to show you how to do it on a trello and just write down how long things take. Now, this is going to do a couple of things. This is going to help you figure out how to group things together, right? If you notice when you're doing a blog post that you open, you know, Ubersuggest four different times during one blog post to look at SEO stuff or find your title or whatever it is, okay, this tells me I want to group this task together because I keep opening it up.

[00:17:47.590] - Cara
This also is going to help you see, like, your best zone of genius. I do not like to record after like 01:00 in the afternoon. My brain is kind of done. So, by two, my kids are a traditional school, so I work pretty much between 9:30 and three. And at 2 'o' clock, I'm pretty done for the day.

[00:18:06.480] - Cara
I've noticed that 2 'o' clock is not my best time. My prime zone of genius time is ten to twelve. So, I know right now that's what I'm recording the presentation, it's ten or nine, right? I know that if I want to get my best work done for things like filming, the things that need my most energy, I try to do it then. Now, you might notice that you're recording podcasts every day or something like that.

[00:18:30.100] - Cara
And some days you do it in the morning, some days at night. And you realize that when you do it at night, it takes you so much longer because you're exhausted. Or maybe you try to do it during the morning, but your kids are home because you're homeschooling, and that takes you longer because of interruptions. This is just going to be like put in a detective hat and say, that's interesting, and make some observations about your time. What it's also going to allow you to do is fill in the gaps of your workflows, so that you can know they're completed and you can guess.

[00:18:55.680] - Cara
So, here's the thing about the trello board. Let me show you this inside trello. What you can do is you can put the times in here. So what if, for example, you were like, I'm going to do a time inventory of my blog flow. I already brain dumped all the tasks that I think I need to do to get one blog post done.

[00:19:13.210] - Cara
But today, I'm going to time inventory. So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to say, okay, it took me 60 minutes or however long it took. And again, guesstimate we're not trying for perfection here. But then what if you get to the next section and you realize, oh, I totally forgot that I also do research on my headings. And I didn't write that down in my task, but it's on my inventory.

[00:19:35.200] - Cara
Well, now you can fill it in here. And now you know the other step. And then you start to see, hey, maybe I can just do my H two research while I'm doing my main keyword research. Like why would I not?

[00:19:45.130] - Cara
But when I started blogging, I didn't realize that I was literally just going step by step when step by step. It doesn't always make sense when you can batch things together. Again, if you realize you're opening up your tools for SEO research, for keyword research, and then you're outlining, and then it's 2 hours later and you have a post on and you're like, oh, I forgot to do my h two research. That's where your light bulb goes. Wait, these are tasks I should put together.

[00:20:08.010] - Cara
So, now I know that when I'm doing my keyword research because my tools are open and all the data is there, I don't have to reload everything or open it or whatever. I'll just make sure I pick my H2s when I'm doing it. Now, you might be laughing like duck hair, that makes sense. But when I started blogging, I had no idea that I was like, oh, that does make sense, right?

[00:20:25.200] - Cara
It's the same thing. I'm doing reels on Instagram. I batch all my videos together because I realized that it was a time saver for me to just open up my camera, set up my ring light, and do all my reels in 1 hour. And then I can get a whole week's worth of reels done and not have to go back and forth thinking about the reel. What am I going to do?

[00:20:41.830] - Cara
Right? Use your brain smarter, not harder. So, step one, make your content plan. Step two, outline kind of what you think your batches are. Step three is where you're going to do your time inventory.

[00:20:53.140] - Cara
You're going to plan out your time blocks. You're going to start to see how long things take. And then you're going to ask yourself a couple of questions when it comes to deciding when you're going to work, when is your largest chunk of time, right? What's the creative tasks? I will record podcasts my kids home.

[00:21:08.230] - Cara
I do not want to, so I know that, like, those are things I want quiet time for. Are there things you can do with your kids around? When I was growing my business, my kids were around if I needed to do something like Pin on Pinterest or make an image on Canva, I can do that in between breaking up the fights and wiping the booties on the potty and pushing somebody on a swing or whatever I'm doing, I can do that. And I can also do it and be interrupted and not annoyed.

[00:21:29.620] - Cara
For a while, I was trying to write blog posts and I had a two year old at home. Anyone else ever do that? That's a terrible idea. And I was getting very resentful towards my two year old because they needed me and I was trying to write. So, what I did was I switched around how I worked and instead when my kid was awake playing in the other room where I was sitting in the room playing with them, because that was the nature of what we were doing.

[00:21:51.060] - Cara
And I wasn't writing the blog post. Maybe I was making the images. So, if I was stopping to play with them for a little bit, my thought patterns weren't interrupted. And I was choosing to use nap time to write because I knew that that was when it was my best time. So, I want you to kind of ask yourself, when is your best time to work and what does that look like?

[00:22:09.700] - Cara
And then here on this time lock suggested schedule, that's the one I kind of pulled up before. But what I do recommend you do nope, not this one. Keep pulling this one up is you go ahead into your cards. That's what these are called or wherever you're planning and you plan out when you're working on what's in that specific, you know newsletter one, newsletter two, newsletter three.

[00:22:30.940] - Cara
This way you know what to work on in your zone of genius. Now, I teach a whole time blocking system that we do not have time to get into today. So, if you want more help on that, come find me. I have courses and videos and stuff, but essentially you're just going to say between these hours, what are the three things I'm getting done? And this will allow you to plan it out.

Okay. Now I'm going to give you a bonus, setting up your delegation plan now. You don't have to do it all, friend. You should be delegating. Now, you may not be financially in the place to delegate.

[00:22:57.720] - Cara
I did not hire or delegate anyone for my first year. Then I started hiring some people on like fiverr to do little things for me. And now five years in, there's a team of seven. It's the whole thing and it's really fun.

[00:23:08.680] - Cara
But in the beginning, I wasn't ready. So, where did I start? I delegated things I didn't enjoy, I wasn't good at, that take me forever. Things that are like my procrastination. Like I hate making images, but my friend loves it and I know that she uses that time to make her image perfect.

[00:23:24.330] - Cara
And procrastinates doing other things because of that perfectionism, those are things to delegate. You can find tons of people. I hired my 16 year old when he was twelve years old. He was working for me. High school kids, intern, there's online jobs at PH fiver, local area moms that want extra money.

[00:23:40.750] - Cara
There's so many people who would like to help you, but also know this, you don't have to delegate. Now you make a wish list. So, while you're doing these tasks, while you're in canva making the image, turn on Loom.com, right, and go in and talk about what you're doing. This is how I make an image. This is the way I do it, so that you have a process when you're ready to hire.

[00:24:02.350] - Cara
The way you can do that on this trello board though, is if you go in here, there's these little labels. So, if we go into a card here and again, this isn't a trello course, but I just wanted to show you how to use it on this board. You go into labels. You can make labels for anything you want. And you can make one that's just called can delegate.

[00:24:18.310] - Cara
And all I want you to do is go through these lists that you've created and say, what can I not do? When it comes to a blog, all the heck I need to do is write it. And at this point, honestly, I can hire a writer. Like, I really don't need to do anything. All I need to do for my blog is record a podcast and send it to somebody else to record it.

[00:24:34.660] - Cara
I'm not there yet, but you know what I mean. Like, there's so much you don't have to be doing. So, I just want you to go through and surf your dream a little bit while you're doing this. It's just smart to get ahead. All right, let's go to pillar four because we're in that time here.

[00:24:47.380] - Cara
But I want you now to start preplanning your task. So, if you've done these other pieces, you have a good sense of like, how I need to get ahead. Now, when you preplan, this is going to give you urgency and it will help you eliminate the procrastination that comes to like, what am I supposed to be doing? So this is what I recommend you do. When it comes to batching, I do teach a twelve week system.

[00:25:08.130] - Cara
But I know that can feel overwhelming. So, if you're not ready to jump into that, why don't we start with getting you one week ahead. When I was a high school teacher I don't think I share this I was a high school teacher for eight years and one of the things I would do is I would not leave on Fridays until all my copies were made and my stuff was organized and my classroom was set up. Why? Because I did not want to go into Monday like feeling behind.

[00:25:32.760] - Cara
Because I knew that on Monday, some sort of fire was going to pop up and my time would not be my own. So, I planned for stuff to happen and maybe I lose my prep. Okay. And this principle helps so much. If you can get a week ahead, how good would that feel?

[00:25:48.510] - Cara
You ever been there where it's like midnight and your podcast episode is due to your podcast editor and you need to send it in and you're up late recording? I don't know, maybe just me, right? That's a terrible feeling. So, I want you to think smaller if that's what you need to wrap your head around it and ask yourself, what do I need to get a week ahead? So, if I'm going in to record reels, I'm going to do what we call a sprint.

[00:26:12.430] - Cara
And I'm going to record not only this week's reels, but next week's. And then that way, I'm ahead. If you want to make it even smaller, when you go in to record today's reel, can you record two? Can you record today's and tomorrow's? Then tomorrow, you already have tomorrow's done. Still record two, then you record. So, let's pretend it's Monday, right? I go in on Monday. I record Monday's reel and Tuesday's reel.

[00:26:36.300] - Cara
So now it's Tuesday. Monday's reel is recorded. So I'm going to record Wednesday's reel and Thursday's reel. And I'm going to add a third Friday's reel. So now I'm a couple more days ahead.

[00:26:48.840] - Cara
I get to Wednesday. Now. I've already got Friday. Done. So now I'm going to do the next week.

[00:26:53.160] - Cara
I'm going to record Monday's real, Tuesday's reel, Wednesday's reel. And then on Friday, I'm recording Thursday and Friday. If you do that system in just a few extra minutes, you've gotten two weeks done, two weeks ahead, and then you rinse and repeat to grow it. So, don't feel like you have to get twelve weeks ahead is what I'm saying. Make it smaller if you need to.

[00:27:15.510] - Cara
But what I want you to think of is what are all the tasks that have to get done this month? What do I have to focus on and what needs to be completed? So, this is what it looks like in the trello board. This is what I keep opening. It looks like this.

[00:27:25.830] - Cara
So, I would go in here and I would say like reels Monday, reels Tuesday. And I would make it super small for myself. Why? Because my brain is overwhelmed anyway. And if I look at my work thing and I say, hey, I just have to do reels for Monday today.

[00:27:42.130] - Cara
Cool. Then I can check it off. I can feel good and I can have that micro in and I can move forward. So, I want you to really think about what that looks like for you and start to plan and get ahead. This lets you get a couple of steps ahead and think about it.

[00:27:58.950] - Cara
Now here's what I want to tell you. Whoo. I told you I talk fast. We covered a lot today. I hope this gave you a great overview of how you can start to use batching in your planning to get ahead, to feel better, to grow and scale your business because you deserve it.

[00:28:14.350] - Cara
The things I'm going to encourage you to work on after this session, and again, don't do them all. Take one to work on. Do a time inventory. If the number one thing that you are like Cara, what should I do first? Do your time inventory because it's going to tell you exactly what you're doing.

[00:28:30.550] - Cara
Then add in those delegatable tasks. Don't know if that's a real word, but we're going to go with it. Create your content plan and start to organize. If you just do this 15 minutes a day for the next two weeks, you will have the next twelve weeks done, I promise you. And then you'll be ready to jump in and start working.

[00:28:45.560] - Cara
