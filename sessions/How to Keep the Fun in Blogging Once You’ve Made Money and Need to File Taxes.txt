[00:00:00.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm excited for the session today with Katherine Pomerantz of the Bookkeeping Artist. Katherine, welcome and thank you for doing this.

[00:00:08.650] - Katherine Pomerantz
Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. I'm very excited.

[00:00:12.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, because pretty much all of my business, financial knowledge I learned from you.

[00:00:16.710] - Katherine Pomerantz
Which.

[00:00:19.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Is you're a great teacher, but it's also reflecting on what a poor business owner I could be. But no, no. I've learned a lot in this last year, and I've come a long ways. And so I'm really excited for your session. Can you tell everyone a little about your background and what we're going to cover today?

[00:00:36.600] - Katherine Pomerantz
Absolutely. Yeah. I am going to talk about taxes in a roundabout way because I came about taxes in a roundabout way. I did not go get an accounting degree. I did not go work in a business the way that a lot of people do. I actually have a degree in theater and dance, and I did the freelance thing for a while. So very similar to a lot of bloggers, actually, where you have something you're really passionate about and you set out to do it, and then you find out like, Wait, this is a business and I need to know business things. And no one warned me about that in art school. So it's difficult. And it was difficult for all my friends, and it was difficult even for all my mentors. There's just not a lot of money knowledge out there. And I wanted to tackle that and I wanted to fix that. So I started just studying money. I knew that there were people who didn't struggle the way that I did. And I fell in love. I felt hard. I completely changed my whole career. I opened my own accounting firm within a year of starting that whole journey, and here we are.

[00:01:39.440] - Katherine Pomerantz
I now just help other business owners do the same things, acquire all the education, but also implement all that education. But we'll get more into that in a second.

[00:01:49.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So why don't you tell us a little bit about what we're going to talk about today besides just taxes?

[00:01:56.720] - Katherine Pomerantz
Absolutely, yeah. I, as an accountant, always get the same questions like, Well, how do I get organized? Can you help me sort out these deductions? What can I do? Honestly, so many of these questions can be answered with a simple Google search. There's incredible bloggers out there who have answered these questions hundreds and hundreds of times, but we read them and we don't follow through. That's the education versus implementation part. The more I've been doing this and the more I work with people who are creative and people who are just really passionate about what they do, the more that I learned the real question is not so much like teach me about taxes. It's, Can you help me with my money stress? Can you help me feel more confident in what I'm doing with this? Can you help me find the answer and feel assured in the answer I'm finding? I think that is really more the crux of the issue. So I have developed over the years a couple of frameworks to help. So I have the let money mindset, and I have this skill that I describe money storytelling. And if you require these two things, really anything, including taxes, becomes easy.

[00:03:03.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
And more importantly, blogging stays fun. You can stay focused on the part of the job you really, really love because you're going to have this really good financial support system underneath you. Just help you grow, help you sustain, help you stay authentic. You don't have to just be into the numbers. So that's what we're going to dive into.

[00:03:21.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I'm excited for that because I think that was part of a beta course you did. And one of my favorite things that I now have is like, my chart of accounts, which I didn't know what that was before, but I can just be like, How much did I make from affiliate marketing last year? How much did I make from client services? How much did I make from product sales? Which products do you make? And I was like, Oh, I like this. So I can speak from experience that you're a great teacher and you do a great job at getting people to take action. So let's go ahead and dive in. I'm going to let you lead the way. Okay.

[00:03:59.650] - Katherine Pomerantz
So I'll close actually. I should also mention that this entire mindset thing we're going to talk about is part of what I describe as the Chaos Money Framework. This is a framework that I actually use with my clients. It has seven steps, and this is how I teach you to not only get a handle of your finances, but also implement right away. Because your blog can't wait around. It's also tax season. You don't have time to just sit and wait around until you get better at money. You need a framework to help you just keep going and keep going and keep going. So we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about step one, because it's the most important step, right? You got to really understand that to do steps two through seven. So step one of the Chaos Money framework is embrace chaos. I describe it as embrace chaos because business is chaotic. It's always moving. Your money is always moving. You got a lot of stuff going on with your blogs. I'm pretty sure most of you also have another job in addition to the blog that you run. Almost everyone does.

[00:04:56.890] - Katherine Pomerantz
So there's a lot going on. And this is where a lot of that stress around money that I first alluded to really comes up because money is an exceedingly emotional topic. Everything that's ever happened to us in our lives affects our relationship with money. Whether you missed the bill and you just got super embarrassed about it, or whether you missed a lot of bills because you were going through something else that was traumatic and your finances were just along for the ride at the time. Whether you fight with your partner about money, fight with your parents about money, just watch your parents fight about money when you're growing up. All of these things bubble to the surface when we have to tackle things like taxes. It's the reason that it feels so overwhelming and so scary and there's so much pressure to get it right. I think a lot of that is really unfair. I think a lot of that comes because we don't really understand the true nature of money because we don't really understand what money is. We don't really know how to put it to work. So the very first thing I always teach people is the Let Money Mindset.

[00:05:54.180] - Katherine Pomerantz
It's a really simple acronym. It means, Let Money Work for you. So the true nature of money, and I mean this literally. We're going to talk some basic economics here, people, is the true nature of money is that money is a language, it is an energy, and it's a teammate. So let, L-E-T, is what we want to let our money work for us. What do I mean by this? Language, we'll start here. Again, literally money is a language. Liz actually just gave a really good example of I have my chart of accounts. I bet hardly any of you know what that means unless you took some accounting classes in college. There is a jargon to this stuff. And so when we talk about profit, when we talk about revenue streams, we talk about ROIs, those all are jargony words that need to be translated. And so this should actually come as an immense relief. I think a lot of people hear this and they're like, Oh, I don't have time to study a language. That's okay. You're not born knowing a language, so you should forgive yourself. No one is born speaking any language at all.

[00:06:56.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
You had to learn it. And each new language you learn becomes harder. And if English is not your first language, you definitely know what I'm talking about. And now I'm asking everyone here to learn the language of money, but there are translators. And so that's one of the best things about the financial industry and the money industry, is that there are translators to help jumpstart this. There are ways that you don't have to be fluent and still be able to get around and still understand. So language is the first aspect of money's nature. Goodness, forgive me. It's very early for me. I'm recording this. It might be a couple of those. I don't have enough coffee.

[00:07:34.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And.

[00:07:35.590] - Katherine Pomerantz
So that's language. And then we're going to go to energy. Again, this is sound woo woo, but I mean this literally. Money is nothingness. It's not a thing. You can hold up a dollar bill, but that's not what money is. And money is not built on a gold standard anymore. We have something called a Fiat currency, which means that money has value because we all just agree that it has value.

[00:07:59.630] - Katherine Pomerantz
Economists.

[00:08:00.540] - Katherine Pomerantz
Can argue about whether or not that's a good system, but it's a system that we've had effectively since the 1930s. So it's probably not going away. And so far it's served us pretty well. So knowing that there's really nothing backing our money except this belief that we all have that money is valuable. What does that leave? How then does money function? And there's a jargony word for this to go back to money's language called cashflow. Money is an actual energetic, creative force. It's going to come and it's going to go. You're going to get money in, you're going to pay money out. And this is what we describe as cash flow if we're talking from a business perspective. But it really is. It operates just like an energy. It operates just like water flowing, how you can divert water into a canal and put it to use, or you can stop water up with the dam and generate electricity. Electricity is another energy. It has a current. You can channel it into these big machines, and it does incredible things for us. That is how money functions. It's even in money's name, currency, that current is all there.

[00:09:01.730] - Katherine Pomerantz
That is part of money's just intrinsic nature. So if you understand the language of money, you can then harness its energy and put its creative efforts to work for you. And finally, you'll turn money into your teammates. And this is the best... And most of all, I'm biased, but this is the best part for me, is turning money into your teammates. I call it a teammate and not just a resource because of that emotional component I alluded to. You have a relationship with money, and you need to acknowledge and honor that relationship in order to make any progress. You got to be able to open up all those door spots and look it in the face and be like, Look, you're important to me, and I'm still going to give you what you need. I'm still going to nurture this relationship. I'm still going to pay attention to you. I'm still going to listen. I'm going to communicate. If you're in your language. I'm going to give you everything you need to thrive. The energy part and all plays together. And then let's be friends. Let's be teammates. Let me treat you like you're an employee at my business and you're going to work hard if I give you all the right tools to do so.

[00:09:59.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
Understanding the fundamental nature of money should give everyone a sense of relief, honestly. Discovering these things was fantastic for me. It was just like, Wow. Okay. I don't have to be so tight-fisted about everything. I also don't have to be so concerned when money is coming and going like it's supposed to.

[00:10:18.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:10:19.690] - Katherine Pomerantz
And so as I started working with businesses and with entrepreneurs who were crazy, crazy smart and crazy, crazy good at this, it was apparent to me that A, they understood money's true nature. Again, I told you I'd do that.

[00:10:36.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But they.

[00:10:38.910] - Katherine Pomerantz
Took it one step further in that they understood money's nature so intensely that they became what I describe a money storyteller. You already alluded to this, Liz, because you're developing these skills. They had the ability to take out financial records, read them over, and they saw through all those numbers to the people and the industry and everything about that business. This is what investors do. This is something I called because I watch people like Warren Buffett who are so brilliant and get all these amazing terms because if you listen to how they talk about their process, they start with the numbers, but they go through the numbers. They see past the numbers. They really dig past these financial reports, and they see the mission, vision, values of the company. They want to reflect on if the CEO is doing a good job. They want to know about the industry as a whole. It's very much a storytelling feature. This is very exciting to me because with my background in dance and with acting, this made perfect sense, right? If we take ballet, for example, choreography is just as technical as money. It has just as much jargon and just as much weird symbolic, amorphous, energetic stuff.

[00:11:52.310] - Katherine Pomerantz
But we as an audience, knowing none of that, can still go on a journey with the dancer. We still understand the story that they're telling. We still have a very emotional connection, and we're still transformed, we're still moved. So I was very comfortable with this idea of like.

[00:12:05.130] - Katherine Pomerantz
Oh, this.

[00:12:06.060] - Katherine Pomerantz
Is a weird, abstract language.

[00:12:09.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To.

[00:12:10.540] - Katherine Pomerantz
Throw back as a language, and it's symbolic, but I can use it to tell stories. And the stories that I want to tell are stories about my business. Money wants to communicate with me. And that is my definition of accounting. Money, storytelling. I want you to see past all these numbers and get back to the story of your business. Where are you headed? How are you doing that? What's this information that you need to reflect? And I think knowing that also makes it a lot easier. It's not about knowing all the jargon. It's not about doing all this math. It's about making decisions. It's about leading your business or your blog, in this case, wherever you want to go. So does that all make sense, Liz? Are we all on board?

[00:12:51.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. No, I'm like, I'm like, Yep, yeah, yeah.

[00:12:54.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
This is a repeat for you. No, but.

[00:12:57.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm just like, It's always good to revisit it too. And I'm like, Oh, how... Because I struggle with QuickBooks. But my chart of accounts, and like I said, I was able to just look at that stuff. I can be like, Well, how much actual blogging I do versus working with others and promoting my products versus... I can see how much time I spend on client. I can look at, okay, well, if I want to move in this direction, what was working there? What was producing that income? It starts to tell the story, like you said.

[00:13:30.890] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yeah, that's amazing. I'm so happy. I'm so proud. I'm so glad that you're getting that experience. It's really empowering, I think. And this is a great time to give one caveat is that a lot of what I'm talking about, if you're a beginning blogger, dive deep into these other sessions that are going to help you get going and help you learn to make income and help you get all your products out there. Once you start making money, then it's time to revisit a lot of this. Because again, I'm not here to help you develop a really good blog. My area of expertise is building out that support system, that financial structure to keep blogging fun, to keep it so you can continue doing it and make money and put it to work and let it all happen. So now that we understand this, embrace the chaos idea, we understand money is language, energy, teammates. We want to be money storytellers. That's the goal. Let's dive into how we can actually pull that off. So this is why I developed the Chaos Money Framework, because again, we can intellectually process those things. Like, okay, sure, we get all the emotional aspect now.

[00:14:31.680] - Katherine Pomerantz
And I'm intellectual on board with, okay, this money storytelling element. How do I actually do that? How do I get started? So the seven steps of the Chaos Money Framework are: embrace chaos, make a value-centered business plan, gather your data, set up your accounting tools, clean up, money map, step six, my favorite, and accountability. And then there's a secret step eight, which is repeat. So again, this is not something that we're going to learn overnight, but this is something to get you moving, to get you better, to learn as you go because you don't have that time to sit around. That's my experience. So maybe I'm biased. That was my philosophy, but it works very well for the type of people I work with. We've taken a deep dive into embrace chaos, and I think that that really is the crux of a lot of the stress around things like taxes. So what do I mean then by the value-centric business plan? This is your translation tool. This is how you're going to dive in and see past those numbers. So we're actually just going to start with the end. Begin with the end in mind is a Stephen Covey thing.

[00:15:39.000] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's seven habits of highly successful people. Great advice. Begin with the end in mind. So I want you to get clear about why your blog exists. What is your mission? Literally, what did you set out to do? Who do you help? How do you help them? What's the mission of your blog? What is the vision for your blog? What do you want your blog to look like in the future? If you're trying to grow this into a really robust revenue stream, you've got to have a clear vision of how that looks in one year, five years, 10 years. Are you going to hire people? Are you going to take on ads? Are you going to find sponsors? Or do you just want this to be a personal diary? And maybe actually it's a way for you to grow a different career and just build your expertise. So what's that vision for your future? What are you working towards? And then what are your values? This is critical. It's understanding what is important to you as a person and how this will help you in your work. An example is freedom is my number one value.

[00:16:34.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
So everything that I do with people is to free them, right? I work with business owners. You start your own business for freedom. And that is something that I very, very much strive for and very much stand for. That's how value could affect a business. So mission, vision, values, turn those into statements, and you got yourself a pretty good plan. You also have a pretty good translation tool, as I mentioned. If you're ever stuck and you are looking at numbers and you're getting lost, look at your mission, vision, and value statements. I point to my wall because I literally have them taped to my wall where I'm like, This is what I'm doing. This is why I'm doing it. This is where I'm going and this is what matters to me. I can now make a decision based on these numbers because this is what I want to do. It's very helpful. So step one, embrace the chaos. Understand the mindset of money is a chaotic force, and that's good. We want that creative energy. Step two, value-centered business plan. Step three, four, five is the accounting part. So first of all, gathered data. Where is your information coming from?

[00:17:34.970] - Katherine Pomerantz
Bank statements? Are you using any accounting tools? Where are you paying bills out to? Just get yourself... Not even organized, literally just write down where does all the information need to find, gather data. Step five is then set up your accounting system because gathering that data, as you guys know for taxes, is difficult if we do it once a year. I want you to build a system underneath you that allows you to do this over and over and over because if you do it over and over and over in little steps, it's a lot easier. It takes only minutes, not hours. And so that's step five is the accounting system. That was step four, excuse me. Step five is then the cleanup, where we actually take all that data and put it into our accounting system and just let it run and just let it automate. I will take a deep dive into accounting systems in a second. So I know I was racing past that, but we'll get there. Because I want to skip ahead to step six, which is what I call your money map. I call it a money map because I want you to be able to do exactly what I described money storytellers doing.

[00:18:39.290] - Katherine Pomerantz
I want you to be able to take out all of your financial reports, which could be just as simple as I have a budget or I have my income statement. I know where my money came from. I have a spreadsheet that just tracks my income versus my expenses. That can be your financial report.

[00:18:54.480] - Katherine Pomerantz
I want.

[00:18:54.890] - Katherine Pomerantz
You to be able to take that out. I want you to be able to read it with your mission, vision, and values in mind, and I want to be able to compare it to the real-world numbers. So your money map is actually going to be a look ahead. This is going to be your ideal. This is going to be like, This is my goal for the year, or This is my goal for the next three months. This is my real numbers. So this is the numbers that actually happen. If you make a budget, this is what I actually spend versus my budget. And rather than feel guilty, like a lot of people, especially budgets, they feel very limiting. They feel very like, I'm in a box. I want that to free you because this is your aspirational goal, and this is where you're at today. Your money map will then be able to help you break this big goal into milestones and track your progress from point A to point B, point C, point D. And because you have things categorized through that accounting system, like Liz said, she can just open it up and look at things and be like, Oh, this is the exact area I fell down.

[00:19:49.380] - Katherine Pomerantz
I didn't bring in as much affiliate income as I wanted, or I way overspent throwing my summit together, which I hope is not the case.

[00:19:56.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm actually doing really well in that regard. Thank you.

[00:20:00.480] - Katherine Pomerantz
No, didn't mean to call you out.

[00:20:03.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's okay. I'm happy to be the guinea pig or the go-to for any... We did that. I just redid my home page like last week, but it was awful because I switched away from a certain page builder and whatnot. And so we're doing a session. I was like, Mine's terrible. You could tear it down. And we went to it and I was like, Oh, it's worse than I thought. Images are broken. I'm good. Don't worry about it.

[00:20:27.090] - Katherine Pomerantz
I'm never worried about you. But that's a good example of how money map works. That's that empowering money storytelling goal I want you to get to. It's a great feeling, you guys. A tax form is another example of a money map. It's actually a really good example of a money map. It's just a money map for the government. They're going to force you to organize everything into these categories, and you put all your data in, and then they have all these formulas that give them an answer. It's a decision making tool, and you have to take action. You've got to pay that final equation off. That's how much tax you owe. That is a money map. Again, it's for the government, though. I want you to build a money map for yourself because the bonus side of that is that not only will you become better at leading your business and achieving your goals, you also make taxes really easy because they will already be organized and you've already been working on it. So that's step six. Step seven then is accountability, where this is my experience. Again, I do this with a lot of people.

[00:21:25.440] - Katherine Pomerantz
I don't know anybody who does business by themselves very well. Doing things like this summit is amazing. Going out and finding resources, finding experts can be your accountability. Asking a friend, asking a colleague, asking your accountant, Hey, can you look over my numbers? This is my budget. Does this seem realistic? Does this seem possible? I love your advice. Doing research about what do other bloggers spend or what do other bloggers make in sponsorships? Those can all be the accountability portion.

[00:21:54.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We have a session on sponsorships and how to price yourself out. Love it.

[00:21:59.880] - Katherine Pomerantz
Love it. You guys are already taking step seven, and I'm very proud of you. Step eight is then repeat. You're going to get better at money the more that you do this and the more that you go through this process. That's actually what keeps you cleaned up. That's actually what makes it easy. That's actually what makes it fun, is seeing your progress over time. This is not, again, money is not static. Embrace the chaos of step one. Money is not going to sit around. You can't just ignore it. It will be doing something. Make sure it's your teammate. Make sure you're reading it. Make sure you're paying attention because it's energetic. It's going to be working. Let's make sure it's working in the right areas. So to recap, embrace chaos. Understand all the mindset stuff we just talked about. Get your mission, vision and value squared away. Gather all your data, put it into your accounting system, clean it up. So make sure all the data gets entered. Build out that money map for yourself. Or the first time once the money map is built, just use your money map. And then accountability. Hold yourself accountable, take action.

[00:22:59.480] - Katherine Pomerantz
Have somebody else hold you accountable, take action, and then repeat. So the repeat part is what we're going to talk about next. But I want to make sure that I hit on everything, Liz. Are we good? Is there anything you want me to clarify?

[00:23:12.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, I think we're good because, as you know, I'm in the repeat and I'm finding little things I missed or mistakes I made when I was setting some stuff up. I'm still clear, but it's a whole process, right? And it's repeating like, I really should be looking at my money a lot more. And yeah. So you're doing great. This is a great refresher for me, and I know it's a great introduction to this for others. So thank you.

[00:23:39.430] - Katherine Pomerantz
Fantastic. Actually, can I share a story that we had with your money system? Yeah. Okay. So, Liz, as she mentioned, doing the repeat and finding all these mistakes. I want to share a story of me as an expert. I do this professionally all the time, still messing up. Where with Liz's setup, with her QuickBooks, there was just an auto rule that was active that messed up a bunch of stuff in her in front of accounts. But because Liz was paying attention to it, she caught it and reached back out to me. It was all like, Hey, this looks weird. And she only noticed it looked weird because she was doing it over and over because she was paying attention to it. Now that it's tax season, it's still January, we've got plenty of time to get it corrected. She's not near... Well, I hope she's not nearly as stressed. I did mess up on her there.

[00:24:24.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I have full confidence in you helping me to fix it, so it's okay.

[00:24:31.530] - Katherine Pomerantz
Excellent. This is again why the repeat matters and why the accounting system matters. We wanted it to be automatic, and we wanted it to do a lot of heavy lifting, and it did. But it's only as smart as we let it be, and so that's why we always also have to clean up. So with that tiny example, that is actually what I want to share with you guys today as my freebie. It's not fancy, I will confess to you all. I love bloggers. I do not have your artistic graphic design skills. I don't have all the pretty website stuff done. That's just not my zone of genius. But I do have a lot of good knowledge to share. I do know that the Chaos Money framework can seem very overwhelming. There are seven steps, and it's taken me almost 30 minutes just to walk them through. I have developed a checklist for myself, for clients over the years for them to use on what I call CEO days where you can sit down and do your money math.

[00:25:23.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's literally what it is in my ClickUp as a recurring task on the 10th to 25th is my CEO day.

[00:25:29.250] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yes, brilliant. Yes. Liz alluded to the thing is I recommend really doing it twice a month. That's really all you need to do is do it twice a month for a couple of minutes. The first time you do it, it might take you a lot longer. We've all been there, right? This is tax season. Sometimes it takes the whole weekend to get your taxes together. It's going to get less. It takes less and less time the more you do it. That's why we have that repeat in the framework.

[00:25:54.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I don't know that it takes less time, but it's like you're spreading out what would be like a whole weekend or several days throughout the year.

[00:26:03.280] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yes. No, and that's true. I still argue that it takes less time because... And here's why, I know I think this is a great point. You're still going to spend the same amount of time, but you're going to be working on high level things. At the end of the day, you're not just going to get your taxes filed. If you do do this and you do money, like Liz alluded to, she can open it up and make decisions about her business. Your focus is going to be a lot bigger, and it's still going to be about the amount of time it takes in a weekend. You'll have a couple of times a year where it's something like redo your money map that might take a couple of hours. But for the most part, once you set it up, you're good to go. And so to help you with that process, I've created checklists for your CEO days. I have weekly tasks, monthly tasks, and even some daily tasks I have recommended. I also gave you recommendations on time limits. If these things start taking you longer than this, especially as you get used to it, I want you to really consider then, is there a way I can up my accounting system?

[00:26:58.760] - Katherine Pomerantz
Is there a tool I can implement? Should I bring on something like Freshbooks because I'm invoicing people now? Is Stripe automating the way it should be? Or am I too busy cleaning it up? Is something like PayPal going to serve me better? I actually would put those as PayPal taking too long to clean up and Stripe automating it better, but personal preference. Things like that are decisions that you can pay attention to because of time. And that's like, okay, that's a great time to read. Like, is my spreadsheet now taking... I used to be a big spreadsheet person. Took me hours eventually. It once I really got things up and running and once I really got good at reading through this stuff, so I switched to some automatic tools. I now use things that automate a lot of the process. This is why it's like, Liz is leveled up all the way to using QuickBooks, which is an incredible product.

[00:27:44.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's totally in the frame. I mean, you can say leveled up and using, attempting and trying. I feel like.

[00:27:51.360] - Katherine Pomerantz
More accurate. Hey, we're all attempting and trying. Software is always updating, and it's always part of the chaos of our system. So it's okay. Yeah. Those checklists I really do want to offer to you guys. So the... Oh. Did I give you? I did give you the link and I don't have it memorized.

[00:28:15.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Don't worry. You don't need to. It is below. So easy peasy. It is below this video. You guys can grab that freebie. So definitely check that out.

[00:28:27.560] - Katherine Pomerantz
Fantastic. Yeah. Good. Yeah, I normally... Again, it's early. I normally have this all prepped and I'm like, Here's the plug and typing your link. And good. Liz again, professional blogger over here has covered us. She's got it covered. She's got me clickable. So if you are interested in learning how to use the framework better and implementing your own CEO days, I have created some very specific checklists just for that; gathering data, setting up your accounting system, and cleaning it up, and how to use your money map. There's a lot of really good tips in there of questions to ask yourself, things to get started, things to think about. And I did break it down. I gave you weekly, monthly, and even annually. There's some stuff in there just for tax season, which I know is coming up. So I can break down and go into some details if you'd like, Liz. But I feel like you can just go get the checklist.

[00:29:16.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, definitely a checklist. I do want to touch on... We said we get back to accounting systems and digging into that because I think a lot of people hear that. And yes, systems are great, and we have sessions on for bloggers because I fully believe in not having to constantly work because blogging is about living your life, not just blogging about it. But the accounting part probably scares them, even though we've talked about the chaos, money framework and whatnot. But if we can touch on accounting systems and where to get started, what to look at, because like you said, it could be a spreadsheet, it could be a tool, it could be... So we can just dig a little deeper there. I think that would be great.

[00:29:58.660] - Katherine Pomerantz
That is such a good reminder. Absolutely. I always recommend if you have no system at all, if you've never really tried to get organized, if this is your very first year that you have to file self-employment taxes or have to worry about taking care of your blog because you made some money, which congratulations, that's amazing. But once you make your first $400, that's when self-employment tax starts kicking in. It doesn't take that long to get to that $400 mark. So how do we get organized and build that accounting system? I always recommend people just start with the Schedule C. So that tax form that you attached to your individual tax return, the Schedule C where you report all of your income and expenses from your business, already has categories for you to sort things by. That is a really good starter chart of accounts. Chart of accounts, all that means is just what categories am I paying attention to? What areas are important to my business? What is it important for me to track? That's a great way to get started, and you can just put that in a spreadsheet, and that can be the accounting system to start.

[00:31:05.700] - Katherine Pomerantz
If you want to level up, and I highly recommend you level up because again, I don't want you to just work for the government, you're working for yourself. What is important to you to know as a business owner? For income, for example, they only want your total. The government doesn't care where you made it from. They just want to know the total amount because they just want their cut. But you need to know your different income streams. So what did you make from affiliate income maybe? Are you freelancing? Are you bringing in ad revenue? Yeah, exactly. So all of those different things you might want to break up. And eventually you might even want to narrow down. Wait, I'm making so much money from affiliate income and not a lot from these others. I'm going to cut them out. Because you were able to break up your revenue streams, you were able to really see that in real time. That's one example for income. Expenses as well is another example, is the government has those basic expense categories. But for example, there is your advertising category is going to be insanely big. I mean, that's going to be your biggest category because it's all your website.

[00:32:06.540] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's where you put a lot of your online tools. That can be like, or a lot of software. I'll just gets filed in their office supplies. Or marketing. I know from... Yeah.

[00:32:15.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I feel.

[00:32:15.750] - Katherine Pomerantz
Like- Yeah, or marketing to the key.

[00:32:16.660] - Liz Stapleton, Host
-or marketing to the key. Because you've got the email marketing software, you've got any ads you're going to do on social networks. You've got social media, automation tools. You've got, yeah. Yeah, and with marketing and course education, I feel like, are my biggest.

[00:32:34.210] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yes, continuing education and marketing are massive expenses for online business owners. They're also the most controllable, however. So if you break those down into, Okay, here's what I spent on my website, not just for hosting it, but any design, any tech, any plugins. This is what I spend on advertising, and this is what I spent on advertising on separate platforms. That's going to give you a lot better data about what was effective, what was really helpful to me. If I spent a ton of revenue on Facebook ads and I did not have an accompanying thing on my Facebook affiliate thing that I was plugging, maybe either improve the ad or don't spend as much. That is not the best use of your business. That's not where it's resonating with your audience. Again, you can't make those decisions unless you've got it organized. So the fun part is the accounting system where you can automate a lot of this. And I am a huge believer in tech. As much as I was giving you a hard time earlier, the cloud is amazing. The internet is amazing. It is a gift, and we should all be happy about it, which since you're all bloggers, I don't have to convince you.

[00:33:42.130] - Katherine Pomerantz
So there's a lot of really good tools for just getting started with a lot of stuff, getting implemented. I do think Quickbook self-employed is a decent program to get started. It will auto-pull a lot of things from your bank and just enter it into there. Now you have to be able to set up your chart of accounts and a lot of things like that, but that's a great first tool. I also recommend Tiller. Tiller organizes things into spreadsheets, and there's no reason you can't hook that up to your business bank account and have yourself sort things. So it's still using spreadsheets, and you can still customize it as much as you want because it's a spreadsheet, but it has that automatic bank feed poll feature. Both of those are paid tools. Okay, I am biased, but I do think this is an area that's worth investing in because it saves you time.

[00:34:32.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And again- I think, Tiller is like, $60 a year. Quickbook self-employed is $10. Now I will say because I was on Quickbook self-employed for a long time, I don't know that lets you do the chart of accounts.

[00:34:46.800] - Katherine Pomerantz
No.

[00:34:47.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Actually. And the downside of that is if you change, like I changed to Quickbooks online last year, is it won't pull stuff in. So if you're starting a Quickbook self-employed because it's a lesson I learned, it's probably not going to be where you end up, and you're going to have to then start over a bit. So it might be worth the extra seven dollars or whatever to invest in QuickBooks online and have something that can grow with you if this is something, depending on where you're at and how much you're earning, things like that.

[00:35:23.020] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's a really, really good point, Liz. That's a really good point. Yeah, QuickBook self-employed is a great starter program, as I said. If you have a lot of business and personal expenses mixed, actually, that's probably the only program that can really handle that. But I recommend, even if you're not making much money, having a separate bank account for just your blogging income or just your side hustle income, because that's also just going to help you stay organized.

[00:35:47.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And when we say separate account, because I feel like this is another misnomer, it doesn't have to be like a formal business checking account. Even if it's just a separate personal account, that is better than nothing. Because you're not able to get a business account until you've registered a state or an LLC or some other entity. There's a little more that goes into it, although it's really not that hard to register as an LLC, and your taxes are still pretty much the same. But we go over that in our other, I think, in some of our legal sessions. But anyway, but yeah, so I just wanted to point that out.

[00:36:23.720] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yeah. No, that is again, a great caveat is that you do not have to have a separate business account for this. You can do it separate checking account. I just recommend the separation. A lot of people actually think it's required. The IRS does not care. They will do their due diligence to get their cut. It's separation for you. Again, it helps you do your accounting system. It makes things faster for you, and that is ultimately what I care about. So two very simple ways to get started with an accounting system. It's just have everything in a separate account and have all that account data downloaded automatically into a spreadsheet with Tiller, which I think is one of the best tools to get started. Or if you are a little bit more serious and you really want to dig into the money mapping stuff, I think QuickBooks is a great tool. Things like Fresh Books also can help because it has some business expense stuff versus income stuff. Dubsato has a little bit of bookkeeping as well. I don't end up keeping a lot of my clients on those, but also I work with people who like our business, businesses.

[00:37:26.240] - Katherine Pomerantz
That may or may not be useful advice for you right now. So related to that, actually, where if you do want to dive deeper and want to learn more, I recommend you pick up the All Access Pass because in the All Access Pass, I have offered everyone a free one-hour session with me. So if you want to learn more, this is obviously very customizable to you and again to your goals because you got to start with step two, that mission, vision, values. We need to know that to get started. You can pick up a free hour with me and I'm happy. I know it's tax season. I know that there are questions. And it's... I don't normally give away hours for free. I normally charge for it. But if you pick up the all access pass, I would be happy to see, to hear from you. So you're going to get a free strategy session with me doing there. So if this is something that you do want this deep dive and you see the CEO checklist and you're like, I'm ready to get bigger or I'm ready to just plan ahead or I'm really- Are you.

[00:38:19.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Trying to get in?

[00:38:20.920] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yes, exactly. You're like, My vision is to have this whole blogging empire. Hit me up. I'd be happy to discuss how you can make this easier on yourself from day one.

[00:38:32.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and that's just incredibly generous offer for all access pass holders to definitely get the all access pass to take advantage of that. Because I've definitely paid her for many hours of her time, and I could tell you it's worth it. So yeah, I mean, any final words of advice for attendees?

[00:38:57.110] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's such a great question, and I should have thought of something. No, I think honestly, you have now seen a bird's eye view of my whole system. It's taking me years to develop, and it helps a lot. I hear constantly from clients who are just so relieved and feel so powerful and have really taken back ownership of their business. So if you want final words, and I would just say, you know what? Go relisten to the embrace chaos portion, give yourself some grace, and try to make taxes a little bit more fun this year. Yes.

[00:39:28.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Thank you, and yeah, that's... And remember, blogging is supposed to be fun. So don't let anything- Yeah, blogging is supposed to be fun. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much, Katherine. I appreciate you taking the time. I want you to go grab the freebie. It's down below. Get that checklist. I actually probably should get it, even though I've...
