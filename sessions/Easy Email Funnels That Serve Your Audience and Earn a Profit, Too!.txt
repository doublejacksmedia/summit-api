Hi guys. Today's session is with Cindy Bidar and I'm really excited about she's gonna be talking about email marketing funnels and we've touch on this in some other sessions. we talked about using a quiz of the funnel, but I think she's gonna dig into sort

Liz Stapleton [00:00:13]:
of the monetization side of it too, kind of Once you've funneled them onto your list, what do you do as well? If I correct me if I'm wrong, but Cindy, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.

Cindy Bidar [00:00:24]:
Thank you. I'm so excited to to join you for this. This is such a an amazing, an amazing event and an an amazing topic to to cover. And I love email marketing, so I'm always happy to talk about it. Like, one of my favorite things.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:
so can you give us just a little bit sort of back your about your background so we kinda know where you're coming from and then the highlights of what you're gonna cover in your presentation.

Cindy Bidar [00:00:49]:
Sure. So my background is I have worked full time online, for the past 9 years now. I started out as a content and copywriter as a freelancer. I moved from there into virtual assistance, and I did technical and marketing virtual assistance for several years. And now I have shifted away from doing the client work, and I'm doing online training and education around marketing for coaches and bloggers and other service providers. Okay. So that's kind of my, my career arc there in a nutshell. And what I focus on now is teaching people how to automate their marketing, how to systemize their marketing, how to create the processes and the procedures, so that they can make more money and spend a lot less time in their office.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:39]:
Awesome. I like it. So can you tell us sort of what attendees are gonna walk away with from your session, like the highlight points of what you're gonna cover.

Cindy Bidar [00:01:47]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So what I find in talking to my clients is that a lot of times, they don't really know where to get started with email marketing. So what I've put together is a presentation that's going to walk them through exactly how to start to build that email marketing list, what to do with those people when they're on their once they're on the list, how to kind of monetize it without feeling all icky all the time about being all salesy. so that's kind of the gist of of what we're gonna cover in the next 30 minutes or so.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:20]:
Okay. Awesome. I'm I'm excited to dig in.

Cindy Bidar [00:02:24]:
Alright. Thanks, Elizabeth, for thta great intro. It's really, like I said, it's really great to join you here for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, and this is such an important topic. So Let's dig right in with easy email funnels that serve your audience and earn a profit too, and they won't be icky. I promise. Here's what I hear from pretty much everybody. when they're first starting out, whether that's you know, whether they're bloggers or they're, affiliate marketers or they're service providers or they're authors. It doesn't matter who they are. the the common statement is I don't even know where to start with building a marketing funnel. And I will tell you what, I have a little survey when people First, join my list that asks them what do they most need help with when it comes to building marketing funnels and probably 80% of the responses are I don't even know where to start. So if that's you, super super common. You are not alone. You are in some very good company. And even more importantly, that's where we all were when we first started out. So it's easy to overcome. I'm gonna help you get started today. And where do we start? Before you even think about the technology, before you even think about making sales offers, before you even think about what a funnel does or how it works, I want you to start with the goal in mind. and not just your goal. Although that's important, we're gonna start with your goal, but we wanna talk about Another goal. We wanna talk about your ideal client's goals because those 2 things, your goal and her goal, and I'm gonna I'm gonna call your ideal client her throughout this presentation. That's just the pronoun that I use. So if your ideal client is a man, This works too. But we're gonna talk about your goal and we're gonna talk about her goal and how they both work together to build an email funnel that serves and earns a profits. Now your goal, this is easy. At least I think it's easy for you. Your goal, you have something to sell. You sell a product. Maybe it's a digital product. Maybe it's an ebook. maybe you sell consulting or coaching or maybe you sell physical products on Etsy or Maybe your whole goal is to drive traffic back to your website, so that you can present people with display ads, and that's how you earn on your blog. Whatever your goal is, that's kind of the first piece that you're gonna keep in mind. where do I want people to go? Where do I ultimately want to send them through the use of this email funnel that I'm building? I want you to keep that in mind as we work kinda through the rest of this. Next, I want you to think about what does your ideal client want? because that's really even more important. If you want to build relationships with people through an email funnel, then you have to start with What do they want? What can you provide to them that's gonna satisfy that need? And we're gonna talk about a a technique that I use to do this in just a second, but I want you to I wanna share an example with you. one of my clients, for example, has, or he is a dating and relationship coach for women in midlife. And what his clients want, what they say they want, and what they actually want are 2 very different things. And that's where 5 whys technique comes in. So what his clients say they want is they want to get married or they want a committed relationship or they want to meet a nice man who's not already married or they want someone to be with on Valentine's day. Right? But that's not -- what they really want. When we dig deeper, when we use this 5 whys technique, and the way this works is to just continue continually ask why, right, just like a toddler just asks why all the time. Why? Why? Why? Why? If you've ever been around a toddler, maybe you've been really annoyed by that. I know I have. I don't have kids. So, you know, it I don't get toddlers, but I know they question everything. And I want you to do that as well when you're building out your email funnel. And here's why. Because What your ideal client says he or she wants is probably not the whole truth. So if we go back to my client and his dating and relationship coaching, his ideal client would say they wanna get married. But if you dig deeper, if you ask why, why do they wanna get married? Well, because they want security or they want companionship. Why do they want security and companionship? because they're lonely. Why are they lonely? Well, maybe because they don't have any friends or maybe they live far away from their family, Well, why is that? And when you really dig deep into it, what he has discovered is what his clients really want is they want to be happy in their life, and they feel that by meeting someone by meeting the right man, that's going to make them happy. But what he's discovered is that's not really the case that happiness actually comes from the inside. So if he can help them find that internal happiness, then that's a better service for them than just helping them meet some random guy on a Tinder app. So that's the kind of dig. That's the kind of deep digging I want to encourage you to do when you're thinking about what does your ideal client or what does your ideal customer or your ideal reader? What do they really want? They and and what they really want may not be what they say they want. So you have to be able to read between the lines and really know them and under stand their motivations and where they're coming from and what their goal really is. And that's gonna put you on the right path to building that email marketing funnel. Here's another way to look at it by asking the so what question? This comes from copywriting. If you've done any copywriting written any sales pages, read any copywriting books, you've probably come across this this technique of differentiating the features from the benefits. So a feature is a description of something. my coffee cup is blue. That's a feature of it. So what? That's the benefit if I answer that So what question I can get to the benefit of having a blue coffee cup? So what? Well, I like the color blue. That's what? So asking that so what question is really gonna help you as well dig into that why your customers want what they want or why your ideal clients want what they want. So they, you know, in the case of my dating and relationship coach client, he his clients think that they want to get married. Well, so what? So they won't be lonely anymore. That's their goal. So if the 5 why's question is kinda stumping you a little bit, then ask yourself So what? When they get this, so what? When they get this thing that they want, so what? What's what's the what there? Alright. So now that we know what your ideal customer's big goal is, what she really, really wants. Let's talk about how you can use your email funnel to help her, help her get there. And the way that we do that is by addressing the elephant in the room. We wanna figure out what's standing in her way and help her get past those hurdles. One big hurdle is tools and technology. So is she lacking the proper equipment, the supplies or other necessary items? An example of this would be if you say you teach, say you teach piano lessons online, maybe you have a membership that that has a piano training, video training inside. If your ideal customer doesn't have a piano, It's gonna be really hard for her to make use of your training. So your job is to, as the expert here, is to make the recommendations to help her make good buying decisions and to help her decide which tools and which technology are the right fit for her. So another example is say you have a recipe blog. Right? Recipe blogs are Super common these days and super helpful. I spend a ton of time browsing recipe blogs. I'll tell you what. I love to read stories. I love to read about new techniques, new to me, and, learn new recipes and also I need the help in the kitchen with the tools and the technology. It was through a recipe blog that I bought my instant pot. It was through a recipe blog that I order new, you know, new to me spices that I've never tried before. So The tools and the technology that are required for your ideal customer to reach her goal are one important part of your funnel content. And, of course, the way you make money with that is by recommending products that you have an affiliate relationship with. What else is standing in her way? Knowledge gaps are a big one. Does she have the basic skills in place, or does she need a quick refresher course? you can easily fill an email funnel with "how to" content that helps your reader or your ideal customer build up those skills. So, again, you know, I if I'm subscribed to a recipe blog and I am interested in learning how, you know, learning how to, cook a really great steak. or grill a really great steak. An email that teaches me the techniques to do that, how to know what the proper temperature of the grill is, and and how to get that that really important seared look on the steak and how to make it fork tender on the grill without turning it into a piece of leather. Those things in an email funnel are gonna be very, very helpful to me. They're not immediately monetizable. They're not they're not gonna bring you immediate money probably, but they're gonna go a long ways toward building those important relationships and keeping your, your email subscribers engaged and active on your email list and reading your emails and moving through your funnel and and making their way towards not only her goal, but yours as well, which is the ultimate goal that you have for your email subscribers. Another thing that you can address in your email funnel is a lack of confidence. This can keep people from trying new things, it can keep people from stepping out of their comfort zone, but it can be easily overcome with the right content. And the types of content that addresses a lack of confidence in your audience are things like case studies or testimonials where you've had other clients or or even yourself where you've overcome some challenge and achieved a goal that is related to what your ideal customer wants. Those kinds of inspirational stories. An example of this is gonna be like weight watchers. If you've ever been on weight watchers or you've ever subscribed to their content, or I would imagine other other weight loss platforms, you know, Jenny Craig, whatever, all have similar, similar styles in their email funnel They will send these inspirational stories about how Sarah lost 75 pounds and you see the before and after picture that can build up the confidence in somebody, build up their, their desire for the goal Plus give them the encouragement to think, hey. If Sarah did this, I can do it too. So the that kind of content has a really important place in your email funnel. No time or money. This is really I gotta be honest here. This is really rarely a real issue. Most often, these are simply objections that people throw out because they can't think of any other reason why they wouldn't buy whatever it is you are offering. And you can address those objections throughout your sales process, throughout your email funnel, and really overcome them easily by not even addressing them directly because what's important to people. If you get to that, if you go back to when we talked about what the real goal is, what the real need is, if you can dig into that and skip past that surface need that they think they want and get to the real issue, then the no time or money thing is not even gonna come up because what people really, really want, what they're really passionate about, what they really desire, they will find the time and the money for. So if you're hearing this objection or you're seeing this objection or you know, your your people are telling you, yeah, that's that's an interesting that's an interesting idea, and I would totally get that, but I don't have the time to study that, or I don't have the money to buy that right now. Then I would say you're probably not getting at the real root goal. You're not digging deep enough into that. Now I don't care what it is that you are selling, what it is that your ultimate funnel goal is There are 3 elements that you need to address within your email funnel in order to make that sale at the end, and that's know, have, and believe. And let's start with the 'know'. Your subscribers, your email subscribers, the people who opt into your list, your community at large, has a prerequisite. They need to know certain things before they can make use of whatever it is you are selling and I don't care if what you're selling is consulting or if what you're selling is an instant pot through an Amazon link or what you're selling is a multi-module training course that you developed and sell for 1000 of dollars. There are certain things that your ideal client needs to know before she can take advantage of any offer. And I'm gonna tell you in just a second how you can address this need in your email funnel, but let's take a look at have and believe first. So the second thing that is required in an email funnel or that is required of your ideal customer for they can make a buying choice is they have to have some things in place. What do they need to already have at their disposal? to make use of your product. This might be tangible things. It might be the tools or the technology or the supplies. Maybe they need paintbrushes or they need an instant pot or they need a piano. Or it can be the intangible things like we talked about the self confidence or the perception of enough time. So what is your ideal customer need to have? And, again, I'm gonna share, I'm gonna tell you exactly how to give that to them in your email funnel in just a second, but before we get there, they also need to believe certain things. Your ideal buyer needs to believe that not only is she capable of achieving this goal, but that you are capable of helping her to get there. And that's important, and we're gonna go over that in just a second. So know, have, and believe. These are three things that you must cover in your email funnel. Okay. So how do we actually put this to work inside your email funnel? So the know piece becomes informational content. This is commonly called nurturing. This is where you are sending your email client or you're email subscribers. You are sending them things like "how to" blog posts, video demonstrations, checklists, webinars, and other free training that can fill in those knowledge gaps that they have in order to prepare them to take advantage of your offer at the end of the funnel. So for example, You might have, like I said, "how to" blog posts. You might have YouTube, videos that you've recorded that demonstrate a technique you might have checklist to help them follow a pros a process or a procedure. You might have free webinars that offer more information. You might have other free training that they can opt in for that's going to help them build those skills and fill in those gaps in their knowledge. The 'have' component, now this is where we get promotional, and this is where I get a lot of pushback from people, if I'm honest, because people tend to think that it's not okay to sell. And I wanna tell you that it is absolutely okay to sell in your email funnels. In fact, it's your job to sell in your email funnels. I wanna tell you something that I learned in the in the corporate world. Before I worked online, I was a buyer for a smallish factory, automotive factory here in Michigan where I live. And I was the only buyer. So I was, like, in charge of purchasing everything from the nuts and bolts that held the machines together to the raw material we used to create the parts, to the tires on the truck that we used to deliver them. everything came across my desk, and it was not unusual for the department head to call me up and say, you know, hey, I need a, I need a particular grade of cardboard to pack these parts in, and we're having a problem you know, with the parts getting damaged on the way. So we need to figure out a new way to pack those. Order me some cardboard boxes for that. Well, I I don't know anything about cardboard boxes. This is not my this is not I didn't go to school and learn about cardboard, but I had people I could turn to, and those people were the salesman. That's their job. It's their job to know all about the cardboard. It's their job to know all about nuts and bolts and screws and cleaning materials and tie truck tires. And The list goes on. There is an army of salespeople out there who are very, very knowledgeable, and all I had to do was pick up the phone and call them. And they would help me figure it out. And that's your job too. It's your job to help your ideal customer make informed buying decisions, whether that is an informed buying decision about your product or an informed buying decision about an affiliate product that you are promoting in your email funnel. The key is that it needs to satisfy this 'have' portion of your funnel. It needs to satisfy a need for your ideal client. And ideally, it needs to help her get one step closer to taking advantage of your offer. Whatever it is that you're selling, whether that's coaching and consulting, or a course, or just additional resources that you are an affiliate for. So your promotional content, those sales emails definitely have a place in your email funnel, and they are of service to your ideal client. So I don't want you to ever forget that. I don't want you to ever think that sending sales emails is annoying or it's icky or you shouldn't be doing it because you absolutely should. It is your job as the expert in your market to be sharing that information with ideal customer. Okay. I wanna skip back to this slide for just just a minute here because this is really important. We talked about asking, so what? We talked about the difference between the features and the benefits. And often what I see happening in email funnels is If you are promoting a particular product or a particular course or a particular, you know, kitchen appliance, whatever it is, whatever it is that you are offering that your ideal customer needs to have in order to take advantage of what your larger offer is. You need to get super clear on the so what piece of that because that's what's gonna make the connection between what you're offering, what you're selling, and what their ideal or what their ultimate goal is, what they really, really want to achieve and why they're listening to you in the first place. A really simple example of this, I told you that I bought my instant pot through a recipe blog, through a link on a recipe blog from Amazon. And I'm certain that the the blogger got an affiliate commission on that, at least I hope she did. But the reason why it the reason why I clicked that link, the reason why I bought it is because she made it clear that the instant pot was not just a pressure cooker. It was not just, you know, a a $100 appliance. It was it was the way that she expressed the so what that made it clear to me that that was what was going to bring me closer to my goal of spending less time in the kitchen and eating delicious food and not having to, you know, spend an hour a half cooking it. So she made that connection between the instant pot that's a pressure cooker and the so what, which is eat delicious food in less time and and make it easier to cook. So that was the so what of the instant pot. And that led naturally to my bigger desire, my bigger goal of more variety in my meals, and less time in the kitchen. So make that connection by really getting clear on what is the so what of whatever it is you're offering. And then the last piece, of course, is the belive. So this is where that inspirational content comes in that we talked about. This is where you're going to be sharing case studies and interviews and testimonials and photos and video and data, if it is applicable. So in my case, data is super applicable because I teach people how to make more money online. So data is important to me if you're teaching people how to use their instant pot, maybe not so much. But interviews and testimonials and photos and video, absolutely. make it real for your ideal customer. Make them believe that they can have that too, that they can achieve that goal that they can have that beautiful Christmas dinner that they can have that amazing relationship they can learn to play the piano, whatever it is that you are teaching, whatever it is that you are selling, the inspirational content piece of your marketing funnel, is where that all comes together for them and where they start to picture it and visualize it for themselves. Alright. So let's recap. When it comes to building an email marketing funnel, what you're going to do is start Always, always, always start with the goal in mind. Keep your goal in mind and your ideal customer's goal. And not just the surface-level goal, dig deep and find out what the real goal is that she has because it's probably -- not what she's telling you. You can use the 5 why's technique or ask yourself, so what? Why does she want what she's telling me she wants? So what? What's that gonna do for her in the end? that's gonna help you dig in and really get to that really real felt need. Next, you're gonna wanna uncover the roadblocks while stopping her from being there now. What's keeping her from having that relationship what's keeping her from creating that beautiful dinner for her family. What's keeping her from learning to play the piano at sixty years old. What is preventing her? What's standing in her way from getting what she really, really wants? Next, address the knows, the how, the haves, and the believes. What does she need to know in order to get there? What does she need to have in place in order to get there? And what she need to believe not only about herself, but about you or about the world in general before she's ready to take action. And finally, throughout your entire email funnel, be the resource that your client needs. They know people don't sign up for your email list because they want you to send them a bunch of fluff. They don't sign up for your email list because you had a cute picture on your on your homepage. They sign up for your email list because they see you as an expert in what you talk about. And as the expert, you have a duty to your email community to be the resource that they need to find success in whatever your niche is, whatever your industry is, whatever your subject matter is. Be the resource that your client needs and don't Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you can't email them offers or that you can't share these amazing resources with them because because people will think that you're spammy or that you are just selling all the time. Don't fall into that trap that it's icky because it is not. It is in the highest service to your ideal customer to be making those offers, and it's what keeps your business in the black. Without the income from your email marketing efforts, you're gonna have to work so much harder in your business just to stay afloat. So don't look at it as if you are being too salesy or too icky or too spammy. Look at it as if you are serving your clients because you are. And you're serving yourself as well by giving yourself the gift of a good income from this business that you work so hard in. I know that sometimes we we might struggle with taking the information that we learn in a training like this and actually putting it into practice. So I want to give you a resource that I created as a part of a paid training product. My funnels 101 course. I wanna give you this resource. It's an email funnel planner. And what it's going to help you do is it's gonna walk you through the different types of emails that you might send in an email funnel. Now the example that I'm using, it is an example from that course is, someone who sells or Christmas ornament patterns and Christmas ornament supplies. So you'll see the example given in in this worksheet of the ideal customer wanting to create a better Christmas memories for her grandchildren but the concept works regardless of what your ideal customer's ultimate goal is And you will see on this worksheet that I've laid out a hypothetical funnel that addresses all of the roadblocks and the know's, the haves, and the belives that we talked about in this training, and you can then take that and plug in your own customers roadblocks and your own customers knows, haves, and believes and actually write out the email funnel that's going to lead her to your ultimate funnel goal, which is to make a purchase by your product hire you for consulting or whatever that case is. So I wanna invite you to download that and work through that as you're building out your own email funnels. I really hope you have found this information helpful and that you are able to go forward and create email funnels that serve your customers and serve you as well. It's been my pleasure to speak with you today. Thank you so much for being here.
