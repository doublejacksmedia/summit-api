All right, guys. I'm super excited to have this speaker back once again. She is an internationally renowned business lawyer, blogger, and coach behind a Self Guru, an online company that's been featured around the world for helping entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses through its affordable legal templates and services. Amira has had the honor of helping over 50,000 entrepreneurs comply with the laws and safeguard their businesses. And she's been featured everywhere, I feel like. Amira, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:38.080] - Amira
Oh, I'm so glad to be back. Thank you, Liz.

[00:00:40.920] - Liz
Yeah. So, today we're going to be talking about contracts, which everyone, I feel like if you're not a lawyer, you're a little hesitant because you feel like contracts make you seem pushy or something. But they are absolutely essential if you intend to make this a business. So, maybe let's just cover kind of what constitutes a contract real quick, and then we'll get into kind of the different ones that you know bloggers may need.

[00:01:05.970] - Amira
Yeah. A contract is simply a legal document, right? It's a legally binding document that basically outlines the agreement between you and the other party. So, there's two parties coming together talking about all the things, and then you outline everything in the contract. It's a mutual agreement between two parties to avoid legal disagreements and legal issues.

[00:01:31.310] - Liz
Yeah. And it doesn't have to be complicated. In law schools, offer plus acceptance equals contract. That's really all it is. Okay, so what are some contracts? What is the best way for kind of ease into it without they may not even realize they're already there. But what are some basics?

[00:01:50.810] - Amira
Yeah. So, there's so many different legal contracts that you should think about having to protect your blog. And one of the first ones that I want to talk about is the one that's actually near and dear to my heart. It has to do with the one that I wish my dad had. So, it could have avoided a massive lawsuit in my own family. So, before I became a lawyer, I was going to go to med school, surprisingly. And one day, I come back home and I watched my dad get served with a $90,000 lawsuit. He was sued by a freelancer that he had hired to help grow his business. And that really turned my life upside down and just motivated me to become a lawyer because I helped my dad navigate through the legalities for over a year. Eventually, we settled, but it was a massive setback financially, emotionally, any way you can name it. So, I've gone through the nightmare myself, and that's why I really, really believe in the importance of contracts. Because if my dad just had that, even though people say it's just a piece of paper, but that piece of paper could have prevented a big legal nightmare for us as a family and the financial setback that we faced.

[00:02:55.320] - Amira
So that's why I'm so passionate about like helping entrepreneurs legally protect themselves and give them the tools. So this is the contract that I want to talk about. The first one, it's called an Independent Contractor Agreement or a Freelance Contract. And that's the one that I wish my dad had. Because anytime that you're working with people in your business, and myself included and I'm sure you too, Liz, we always hire people, right? Whether it's contractors, sometimes we hire employees too. But especially in the very beginning to save costs, and it's easier to just hire contractors and dependent contractors in your business, you always want to make sure that you as being the client, that you make sure that you have that Freelance Contract, also known as Independent Contractor Agreement, to outline the scope of works of payment, any other conditions or requirements that you and the client has agreed upon, to just make sure that both parties are on the same page and avoid any kind of legal dispute.

[00:03:52.240] - Liz
Yeah. And I just want to add to that, it doesn't matter who you're hiring as a freelancer. So, my VA is actually she's like my lifelong best friend. She's basically an adopted sister. And we have a contract. We're like, look, we don't want this to ruin our friendship because it could, right? If you didn't have that. So, it doesn't matter even if they're like a family member or someone super close, have a contract in place because it's just going to really, it's going to be helpful. So, I just want to throw that in there because I feel like some people are like, oh, it's just my sister, whatever, but no, have a contract.

[00:04:24.110] - Amira
And that's a great point that you raised because as lawyers, we've seen that happen all the time, that people, like the best friends, the relationship goes sour because they didn't have this agreement upon the financial terms and so forth. And I feel like whenever money is being exchanged, you should always cover yourself and make sure that business is business, personal is personal, right? So, it just keeps the relationship together. And even in my dad's case, the person that ended up suing him was his friend. So, not only my dad felt betrayed, but he also felt like, well, he got punished for being the good guy and trusting this person, the so called friend. And then next thing, you get hit with this massive lawsuit. So, it happens all the time. It doesn't matter whether it's a family member or a friend, you should just make sure that you protect both parties.

[00:05:11.200] - Liz
Alright. So, beyond Independent Contractor Agreement, which like, seriously have one, if you freelance have one, whatever side you're coming at it from, what are some other contracts that might be important for an online business owner?

[00:05:25.630] - Amira
Yeah. So, one of the other ones that is really important for an online business owner is the Terms and conditions. Now this one is a little bit different than your website terms and conditions. I mean, you could certainly make your website terms and conditions to be comprehensive enough to include your products and services, but usually, this is the terms and conditions that I'm referring to, which has to do with any products or services that you sell from your site. So, you always want to have, like, these essential, this is one of the essential business contracts that every entrepreneur or blogger would need because they set out the rules, governing your relationship between you and your customers or your clients if you're providing services. So, by having these clear terms and conditions, you not only protect yourself from any legal action, but you also ensure that your products and services are used the way that you want them to be. So that you protect your copyright, you protect your intellectual property, so that you know that the customers are going to use your content the way that you intended them to. And it's just a great practice, business practice, for you to like also come across as a professional, right?

[00:06:27.660] - Amira
So, someone who really knows what they're doing when they have these terms and conditions properly laid out. And also it just avoids legal issues related to refunds or you know money back or any of those kinds of issues that come up if you don't have terms and conditions. So, this is definitely one of the areas that I feel like sometimes I have come across the bloggers that they forget and then when they run into like a legal issue, where like, a customer has asked for a refund, then they'll reach out to me and be like, what do I do? And I'm like, well, you don't even have any legs to stand on. You don't have any terms and conditions. So, this is why it's really important to make sure that you don't get that financial setback, but also to make sure that your customers truly understand how you intended your services or your products to be used.

[00:07:14.820] - Liz
Yeah. And I will, I do want to add, so one thing I think a lot of people forget to do is they set those up and they forget to change them as their business changes. So, I actually have it as a recurring task in my project management tool to go and review all of my legal policies, like every six months and make sure they're up-to-date and reflective of where I stand now. So, I just would add that as a, you know if you haven't looked at them in a while, if you had them, great. But if you haven't looked at them in a while, go take a look and update them.

[00:07:46.090] - Amira
And it's also, no, that's a great tip. And another tip that I would add is, like, sometimes it's not good enough to just have these, but you also have to get that electronic acceptance, right? So, on your sales page, before that transaction happens during the checkout process, figure out a way for them to at least click to accept your terms and conditions to be bound by them, because that's another important step that sometimes people forget and they think that okay, I just have it on the sales page, so I'm good enough, you know. But you do need that electronic consent.

[00:08:13.860] - Liz
Yeah. And most, I feel like, checkout tool [crosstalk 00:08:16] pretty easy. Yeah.

[00:08:19.090] - Amira
Yeah.

[00:08:19.400] - Liz
And I will say as part of that, like that is huge because when you get those charge backs, you can fight them and you can keep that money.

[00:08:26.770] - Amira
Yeah. I know.

[00:08:27.500] - Liz
And that [crosstalk 00:08:28] help in doing that. I think everyone's like, oh my God, I got a charge back. Like, can I even win this? I'm like, yeah.

[00:08:33.910] - Liz
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:08:34.220] - Liz
You absolutely can.

[00:08:36.850] - Amira
I've actually helped a couple of bloggers win them because once they had set it up correctly and we had that acceptance, then yeah, they were able to fight and then they were able to win. So, it's totally yes, you're absolutely right. And then also, you know, going back to the terms and conditions, you also want to make sure that you have your privacy policy and the disclaimers also set in, and you can incorporate them by reference into your terms and conditions. So that's another step because you are collecting people's personal information, right, like their names, their credit card information, their email address. So, it is definitely a legal requirement to have a privacy policy, too, even though it's not a contract contract. But I just kind of wanted to mention that that's also a legal document that you should absolutely have on your website and even on your sales page.

[00:09:22.610] - Liz
Yes. Yes, absolutely. And we won't get into all the different legalities of conditions.

[00:09:27.750] - Amira
Yes, there's too many.

[00:09:28.870] - Liz
Because there's like six different ones and it's a whole thing, but okay, so privacy policy kind of incorporated into your sort of electronic agreement of those terms and conditions. Okay, so what other contracts come into play? I mean, I can think of a couple, but I feel like, I'm not sure, whatever you want.

[00:09:47.340] - Amira
Yeah, there's so man. There's so many.

[00:09:51.100] - Amira
So, the other third one, which is really relevant and I think it pertains to and it's something that we all will use at some point or some stage of our business and that has to do with using other people's, like photos, videos, audios, testimonials and things like that, legally in your business. Now, there are different names for it, right? You could call it like a testimonial release if it's a testimonial. You could call it like a podcast release if it's an audio or podcast that you're using. But I have kind of combined it together into what's called a media release agreement to just make my life easy as a lawyer and also my customers'. So, media release agreement is basically the type of contract that allows you to use other people's content in that capacity legally, with their permission, and not have to owe them compensation. And then the release part of the agreement basically releases you from legal liability. So, this way you know that you can safely use other people's content, because if you don't, then you run into a bigger legal issue dealing with copyright violation or any other kind of privacy violations, and so forth.

[00:10:53.830] - Amira
So, you protect yourself and prevent yourself from these legal troubles by using a media release agreement.

[00:11:00.660] - Liz
Yes. Every single speaker of the summit had to sign a speaker release, so. And I've always done that every year. And this past summer, I actually got, so it turned out to be like a prank or whatever. Someone impersonating a speaker, saying they were suing me for not paying them.

[00:11:18.700] - Amira
Oh, my God. 

[00:11:19.650] - Liz
So, I reached out to the speaker directly. I was like, first of all, this doesn't sound like you, and I know you've had some of these issues, So, A, is this you?. B, here's the contract, and like, you know. So, I was like, I know it's covered, but it's still stressful. So, you want these things regardless. So, yeah, yeah.

[00:11:37.240] - Amira
Yeah, no, absolutely. It's crazy, right? Because anything can happen in the online space. So, yeah, you have to protect yourself.

[00:11:44.650] - Liz
Yeah, it's a little bit of a wild west in a lot of ways still, because a lot of you know laws just are trying to catch up.

[00:11:52.090] - Amira
That's true. That's true.

[00:11:54.340] - Liz
Okay, we've covered independent contractor agreement. We've covered terms and conditions for products and services, covered a generalized media release. What's next?

[00:12:04.160] - Amira
So, this one, the fourth one is also kind of tied into the media release. But this is a little bit on a different level. This one has to do with guest blogger agreement. So, anytime that you're accepting guest posts on your site, which as bloggers, we do all the time, I mean, I accept guest posts on my website. And so, this is a great way for you to build traffic to your site, also build relationship with fellow bloggers and so forth. But again, anytime you're having these kinds of relationships, you want to protect them. So, this is the type of contract that where a guest blogger gives you, the site owner, the legal rights to be able to use their content, whatever that they put together for you, it may be images also included in the guest post, also the videos that they're giving you. So, you just want to make sure that you have all of that done legally. So, when you accept those, you know those guest posts, that's already done for you. And also, you could include your guest post guidelines as part of this contract. So, this way, someone submitting the guest post to you will also have a clear understanding of what are your site rules.

[00:13:06.570] - Amira
Right? What is it that you allow? Maybe you allow one do follow link, or maybe you allow don't, and sometimes you might even want to get compensated. So that is also something that you have the option of including in this agreement. Like, some of my customers have actually said that, hey, I'm paying for a guest post, so I want to be able to have that compensation provision in there, which, you know so you could add all of those things as well. And again, this just protects you from any kind of intellectual property or copyright law violations and so forth before you start putting that content, which is prepared by a third party on your website.

[00:13:45.190] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, because most often I say guest posts aren't money isn't typically exchanged. That's where freelancer is where you're getting sponsored content. But for guest posts, like, you don't want to be liable if they plagarized, or if they stole an image, or you know. And I'm embarrassed to say I don't know if I've ever really done a guest post agreement granted, I haven't guest posted really in years, you know, so like. I started blogging in 2014, but I've always had email right, and be used as a contract, but it's not the best. So, yeah, definitely. And those are things I never even really thought about because I didn't do images and stuff like that and I wrote my content, right, you know. But the stuff you always, especially if you don't know the blogger well, even if you do, you want those things, but it's far less likely to lead to issues when you have that in place.

[00:14:44.230] - Amira
Right. And it just also includes things that you don't think about, such as your legal right to edit the guest post, you know. Maybe you want to make some edits to the actual content received before you publish it on your site, so you want to include all those terms. So, this way there's no confusion between you and the guest blogger and it just maintains the relationship, especially if it's like maybe you have some sort of an arrangement where the person is giving, maybe it's an agency or something, right? Like they're giving you four guest post per a month. And that does happen. And I do have bloggers that have that kind of arrangement, so it just varies from situation to situation. And it's just a good idea to have some sort of, like terms and conditions of your guest logging arrangement outlined and nicely put together on your site to make the whole process move and efficient.

[00:15:31.050] - Liz
Yes, I do have that on my site, though. I will say that. Which is why a lot of people don't end up making it through because they said I was like, this isn't even like my requirements for pitch, so.

[00:15:41.830] - Amira
Yeah.

[00:15:42.210] - Liz
I can do more and one less thing off my plate to have to deal with.

[00:15:48.260] - Amira
Yeah, exactly.

[00:15:48.530] - Liz
All right. So, we kind of touched on it. I don't know if this is on your list, but sponsored post, sponsorship in general, right, doesn't necessarily post. I'm working with sponsors for like the first time ever, really. I've never done sponsor. I've done two sponsorships in the like, what?

[00:16:06.150] - Amira
Oh, aren't they so exciting, though?

[00:16:08.490] - Liz
It is, yeah. So, I've got sponsors for the Summit this year. You guys will have seen them, you know, as you're watching this, but I was like, I got to get a contract together, you know. So, what are some of the things that's involved in that and terms you would want to make sure to touch upon.

[00:16:25.000] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. So, sponsorships are like really one of the fun parts of blogging, I feel, because I've also started doing sponsorships and I absolutely love it. So, first of all, what exactly is sponsorship, right?

[00:16:37.180] - Amira
Sponsorship is when the brands actually pay you to create sponsored content, meaning create content for them, which in turn also gains them visibility and exposure. And then if you have some sort of like followers or email list or traffic to your site, or maybe you're creating videos, then you again bringing more traffic to their product or service that you are promoting, right? So that's essentially what it is where they're paying you to create that content. Now, that content could be a blog post. It could be just simply sharing it on your email list and newsletter blast. It could be even creating a video, which is exactly what I did not too long ago. I created a, video, a sponsored video. So it could be multiple different ways that you work with brands or simply posting on social media. Like if you have a lot of followers on Instagram, that's another sponsorship that I have done too, where I have shared some products on Instagram and I was paid for them. So that's one of the things that, you know, it's really exciting to be able to work with brands and to get that kind of money to be able to create the content.

[00:17:39.250] - Amira
But there are some legalities associated with that. First of all, under the Federal Trade Commission rules, you do have to give what's called a sponsorship disclaimer, right, disclosure. And you have to let people know that, hey, you were compensated for this. So, if it's a blog post, you're going to need a sponsorship disclosure in there that's going to say something along the lines that, hey, I was paid to write this blog post, however the views or opinions on my own, or whatever the case may be. But you do need to put people on notice letting them know that you were paid for it. Same thing for the video. Like if the video you do have to give, that's kind of the same thing as what we do with affiliate links, right? When we share affiliate links, we have to give those mandatory disclosures to comply with the law. So that's one thing to keep in mind. The second thing is, you know as part of this agreement, it's really, really important to have one. Most of the time the companies will just have their own agreement, but there will be times that you're working with maybe a newer company or they don't have an agreement and they'll say to you to provide the agreement to them.

[00:18:40.500] - Amira
Then in those cases, you would need what's called the sponsorship agreement or sponsor force agreement. And this way you can provide them the contract. You can fill in the information such as, you know how many posts, how many blog posts, details as to like, okay, when will you have this content created by, what are the payment terms, will you be paid upfront or will you be paid afterwards by, you know, all kinds of stuff, maybe even a late penalty thing, or also, like, how long will this content stay on your website? Because if you're writing a boss, you don't want to be like, giving them forever rights, right? So, you kind of want to reserve the right. Maybe after a year they pay you another fee or something. So, you want to negotiate all the terms before with the brand and then kind of nicely add them all into the sponsored agreement to make sure that both parties are on the same page.

[00:19:32.340] - Liz
Yeah, and I did just want to throw in there. Payment doesn't necessarily have to be cash. If it was a great product that still counts and you need to disclose that and then don't be afraid to negotiate. It's really funny because I think you think, oh, these are big brands. Like, I don't want to you know negotiate, but a lot of times the person you're dealing with is like, totally fine with there. They're like, that's okay, let me just double check, you know like. Like, there's a point person, but they're not necessarily the like and all the all, and they're happy to negotiate, so don't be afraid to ask for what you want.

[00:20:06.720] - Amira
Yeah. And another pro tip is that you don't have to be the first one to give them your number. You can always ask them, what's their budget? Right? So, this way you kind of find out where do they stand and then from there start the whole negotiation process for however long your time is going to take or what the commitment looks like. So, there are many different ways to negotiate, but yes, I totally agree with you, Liz. Like, never just settle with the first offer that you get because you're short changing yourself that way.

[00:20:32.370] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah. And really look over any agreements they send you. So, I want to add back when I was freelancing, like, I was like, this is missing a page, right? Like a jump from like, page seven to page nine and reference causes in there. And I was like I was like, I'm not signing this, you know. And then she's like, I don't understand. I was like, no, it's literally missing a page. Like a page didn't get scared. Like, it took me like, five emails and then finally they're like, oh, we need to go ask legal to get the right contract, because they just didn't even realize, you know? So, yeah, just keep in mind, make sure you really read carefully. Okay, so that's five we covered. What is the sixth one that you want to touch on?

[00:21:13.720] - Amira
Right? So this is the last one, but not the least. There's so many. But this is the one that I also want you guys to remember, especially if you have an affiliate program for your products, then definitely make sure that you use what's called an affiliate agreement. There are so many different names for it. Affiliate terms and conditions, affiliate program agreement. Essentially, these are the terms and conditions that are regarding your affiliate program, so that you and your affiliates are promoting your products legally, and that they're also understanding what's the commission, what's the cookie period for your affiliate links, and just all the different terms of your agreement, right? So, you might want to restrict them from promoting your product a certain way, or you might want to give them certain legal rights, such as, oh, you can use our images, and so forth. So that's why it's really important to make sure that your affiliates are doing things the right way and the way that you want them to. And that's the whole goal of this agreement. So, make sure that before you start having affiliates, which is a great way to, of course, grow your network and have people promote your products, but just make sure that you have affiliate terms and conditions, affiliate agreement in place with them.

[00:22:26.200] - Amira
And till this day, I get emails like, okay, I have obviously one, but till this day, I will get an email about like, well, I didn't receive this payment. You know, I'm like, well, as per our terms, payment is not due until 30 days, blah, blah, blah, you know. So these are the kind of things that you can easily refer them back to. Imagine if I didn't have an agreement and then somebody asked me and they would get upset with me because they would think that I'm not giving them their commission. But that's not the case. That's just our policy, right? So that's why it's so important to outline those policies. Maybe you want to have a period of 30 days before you release payment to your affiliates, which is a good idea, in case there's any chance of refund or any kind of thing. So, you need to outline that in your affiliate agreement. So, this way, your affiliates know when to accept payment, otherwise you're upsetting them.

[00:23:14.610] - Liz
Yeah, and you don't upset affiliates. And just a pro tip, I would say, is have the affiliate agreement or terms, whatever you're calling it, easily accessible to affiliate. So, you know have it in with the affiliate materials of like, hey, if you're curious about the cookie period, if you don't know, you know, here's this, and I see this even like, you know, I'm an affiliate for products. Yes, I'm an affiliate program, you know, but I'm an affiliate for products, and I don't even know where to start. Like, I saw it when I signed up. I don't know where it is now, you know. So, I would just say, it's extremely helpful to your affiliates if you make that easily accessible, it's helpful to you because then you're getting less emails.

[00:23:52.390] - Amira
Yeah. You're getting less questions, and that's exactly right. Exactly. That's very true. And it just makes it easier for the affiliates to be able to see. And like I said, there are some affiliates that will impose certain conditions. For example, I remember when one of the products that I was promoting, it was a course that I had taken. So, I was like, oh, great, they have an affiliate program, so I'm going to promote this. But good thing I read their affiliate terms being a lawyer, I mean, this is fun stuff for us, but maybe not for someone who is not a lawyer. But if I didn't read it, I would eventually violated their rules because as part of their affiliate terms and conditions, they prohibited you from, for whatever reason, promoting it on Pinterest. And I don't know why, but they did. They prohibited that. So, good thing I read those terms and I'm like, okay, I can't create a Pin about this or I can't do this or I didn't promote them on Pinterest, but I did promote them, like in a blog post, which they did allow. So, again, every program or every creator is unique in their own way, so there might be certain restrictions and conditions that they would add into their program, which you won't expect to know unless you actually glance through them and review it to make sure that you're abiding by their rules and regulations.

[00:25:05.810] - Liz
Yes, okay. And just to recap for everyone, we talked about independent contractor agreements, we talked about product and services terms and conditions. We talked about media release, guest post agreement, sponsorship agreements, and affiliate program agreement or terms and conditions. Any final tips on contracts that you think they should know?

[00:25:24.240] - Amira
Yeah. So, contracts to me are honestly the backbone of your business because, again, speaking from experience, anything can, this is such an easy tool at your disposal. They don't take a lot of work. You can easily you know get contract templates from lawyers, and then you can just put it all together for you. So I feel like it's a no brainer to use contracts to protect the relationship that you're building with other people while working in your business. And no matter what kind of business that you're creating, you're going to need help at any point in your business. So, it is a wise idea to always protect your interest, but also make sure that the other party fully understands how it is by working with you. And it just honestly makes you look like a professional when you have a good contract that you're using. And I would also caution against using free legal templates. A lot of people think that I can just Google a contract and I can just take something from online and that's good enough. It's not always the case because as a lawyer who has audited free legal templates, I always find them to have loopholes.

And I'm sure, Liz, you would agree with me on this that free is free for a reason, you know. It's not like it is comprehensive enough. It's not going to always protect you for different scenarios. And you might be looking for something particular that the free one is never going to, you know it's not going to give you all of those legal protections, and you don't even know what the things that are missing in there, who put together the free one, you know it could lead to also copyright violations too, because it's not necessarily written by a lawyer or anything. So, I would always say that play it safe when it comes to your business. You are building a business. They'll make sure that you cover yourself and protect it.
