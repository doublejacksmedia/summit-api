[00:00:13.550] - Angela
Hi there. So, in this video, I'm going to be talking about sales funnels and how you can use sales funnels to increase your blogging income. My name is Angela Mary Vaz. And I am I'm the creator, blogger and illustrator behind Stray Curls. Let's get started. 

[00:00:34.050] - Angela
So, I'm going to be covering a lot of topics, starting with what exactly is a sales funnel? Why you need a sales funnel? What are the five stages of a sales funnel? A mini example, how do you build a sales funnel from scratch and then end with a flipping?

[00:00:51.250] - Angela
Alright. So how exactly do you monetize your site if you are constantly talking about your digital products or throwing an affiliate links wherever relevant, but you are not getting clicks, it means that something is wrong. Right. So, what do you do? You usually write and promote more content in order to generate more traffic.

[00:01:13.260] - Angela
But traffic is not the only answer, because now you're stuck in a vicious cycle of writing and promoting content, right? You're basically aiming for more page views, and that is a little difficult to do on a daily basis. So, what if you didn't have to chase page views in order to get more sales? That is where a sales funnel comes in. Okay.

[00:01:42.370] - Angela
So, the next question is, how long does it take to get people to buy from you? See, here's the thing, people never buy immediately. They need time to be nurtured to get used to your content, to get a sample of your personality and understand what your business and blog is about before they buy something from you?

[00:02:03.540] - Angela
Right. So, have you ever read a good blog post and signed up to a person's mailing list? And then you receive hundreds of emails asking you to buy from them. It's a huge turn off, right. Because that's not something that you do.

[00:02:21.000] - Angela
We are used to being sold to everywhere we go. And this is the thing. As a blogger, you need to focus on building trust and a very strong relationship with your readers. Once you've done this, then you can push for the sale. So, in short, a person needs to read your content, get familiar with who you are, who your content is, and eventually they realize that they need to buy from you.

[00:02:51.480] - Angela
But you should not force them to buy from you as soon as they have landed on your site. Okay. So let me proceed with what exactly a sales funnel is. A sales funnel is a journey that your customers take to purchase your product or your service. Right.

[00:03:07.240] - Angela
And the reason why it's called a funnel is because a lot of people enter the top end, but only a few of them will end up becoming customers. So, you can see the gif that I've made here and you can see there are people entering and you get money from the other end. People go in, money comes out.

[00:03:33.010] - Angela
Yeah. Why have a sales funnel? You know exactly where you are slipping. So, as a blogger, you need to take the reader through multiple sequential stages for him or her to become a customer. Right.

[00:03:45.780] - Angela
So, this requires implementing a few strategic steps in every stage. And when you implement sales funnel in your blog, you will understand where you're falling short and where people are dropping off. That is where people are dropping off in which stage. For instance, when I was creating sales funnels for my blog, I didn't have any trouble getting people to subscribe to my mailing list.

[00:04:07.560] - Angela
In fact, that is actually one of my strengths. But I wasn't very good at email marketing, and this was a slight problem because I noticed that people were either unsubscribing or they were just becoming dead weight on my email list. Right? So, I knew that I needed to work on my email sequences in order to get them to the end and then make the purchase. So, this is what I did. And I was able to see results within two to three months because I actively focused on email marketing.

[00:04:39.950] - Angela
Now I generate sales on a daily basis, and it's mostly passive income. Second reason, you'll have a lot of leads. You can basically convert existing readers into customers, meaning instead of constantly working towards getting more traffic, how about capturing your already existing traffic and marketing to them endlessly? Doesn't that sound so much more easier? So, this is what sales funnels can do.

[00:05:09.880] - Angela
You can basically convert the people that you already have two customers. Third, launches are pretty exhausting, but sales funnels contribute to passive income. Now say you have a couple of digital products and you have a launch. A launch can be incredibly draining. Also, your income is going to go up and go down because during the launch, you're going to make a hell of money.

[00:05:37.060] - Angela
And then after the launch is done, your sales are going to tie down unless you find a way to automate your sales. And this is where sales funnels comes in, you're going to have to constantly push out content or keep creating products in order to keep making sales. So, this is not a great idea, and launches are exhausting not only to you but your readers, especially if you're promoting the same product multiple times in a year. It is going to get exhausting because people on your list will get tired of seeing the same launch over and over again.

[00:06:10.620] - Angela
This is why you should set up a sales funnel so that you wake up to sales every single day.

[00:06:16.740] - Angela
So, how do you know that you need a sales funnel? For instance, in one month, if you're making $200 and in another month you're making $2,000, your sales are inconsistent. So, this is when you should implement sales funnels. People aren't ready to buy all the time, so there may be people on your list who are not ready to buy at the moment. And they may need and want your product, perhaps six years.

[00:06:44.780] - Angela
Sorry. Perhaps six months or one year down the line. These people need nurturing. They need education, they need support. They basically need to understand where they have a problem and how your product or your service can help them solve that problem.

[00:06:59.010] - Angela
So, this is where sales funnels come into play. Let's move on to the five stages of a sales funnel. So, stage one is awareness. Stage two is interest. Stage three is decision, stage four is action, and stage five is retention.

[00:07:16.310] - Angela
So, you don't need to memorize all of this. I'm going to go into detail as to what each one is actually about starting now. So, awareness, basically, in the awareness stage, they get to know you exist. In short, if someone sees a pin on Pinterest that leads to your blog post, they start reading your blog post that comes in the awareness stage, or they find your blog post via Google Search.

[00:07:41.890] - Angela
That is the awareness stage. So, you are basically raising awareness of a problem that your readers have. They either click on a social media post or a search engine result land your blog post and you're reading about it. Right. So, in this stage, you have to assume that your reader knows absolutely nothing about you, which is why every single post that you write needs to be extremely thorough and informative. Right?

[00:08:04.880] - Angela
You need to understand the topic really well and then mince it in such a way that they are able to understand and they fall in love with the way you write, with the way you present your information. And this leads to the interstage. What exactly is the interstate? It basically means that your reader loves your blog posts so much that they want you to keep in touch with them. They want to know more about you.

[00:08:33.930] - Angela
They want to know when you release the next post or what are you talking about next? They just want to follow you in some way. And this is where you basically, this is a very important step in the sales funnel stage because you are getting them to subscribe to your email list. This also means that you need a very good lead magnet. Right.

[00:09:01.700] - Angela
So, what is the lead magnet? The lead magnet is a freebie that you give to somebody in exchange for your email address. Now I use ConvertKit, but you can use any email marketing software like MailChimp. There are three characteristics of a brilliant lead magnet. One of them is it should be highly related to your niche and the product that you're pitching to them at the end of the sales funnel.

[00:09:21.590] - Angela
Otherwise it's not going to work. Second, it should be really fast to consume, so something like a worksheet or a workbook or a checklist or a small mini training. And third, is it should be extremely valuable. You are not going to push your product or your service to the person at this stage of sales funnel. This is the place where you give them something for free and they just give you their email address.

[00:09:50.850] - Angela
Right. So, you have to continue to provide valuable education to your reader in order to show them how helpful you are. You are basically priming them to purchase your product at the end. The third stage is decision. This is where the reader is actively deciding to purchase your product or not, where they reach the end of the email sequence and you can offer them a limited time offer.

[00:10:16.230] - Angela
Right. So, say your reader has reached the end of the email sequence and I still not purchase your product or service. What can you do? You can send them a targeted email after two days offering the same product of service for 30% off, but make sure that it's a limited time offer. That means it should be time sensitive.

[00:10:34.540] - Angela
Right. So, this deadline will push at least 20% to 30% of the people who have reached the end of the sales funnel and have not purchased. And you can do this by using the evergreen countdown timer on a page.

[00:10:53.750] - Angela
The fourth stage is action, where the leader has decided to purchase from you and you have just earned a customer. Right. Now that you've reached the end of the funnel, it's not over because the fifth stage is retention. This is the stage where you keep them happy until they are ready to buy from you again, meaning you have on the customer who also becomes a loyal brand advocate where they talk about your product, help you get more sales, and they also keep buying your future products. So you have earned a customer for life.

[00:11:31.490] - Angela
And this is the fact it is five times easier to get a customer to purchase from you again than to earn a brand new prospect buyer.

[00:11:39.920] - Angela
So, it is important to focus on retailing your customers rather than always trying to get new ones. Right. Now, let me give you an example of a sales funnel. Okay, let's say you have the best coffee beans in the world and you are selling packets of ground coffee in different flavors. This is just an example that I conjured up. Now, even though your product is one of the best in the world, you still have to implement sales funnels in order to have a continuous flow of sales. Right.

[00:12:09.200] - Angela
So, your product differentiation is that your coffee is not only more pure than the coffee sold at regular coffee store, but it's also cheaper. Okay. So, you know that when someone purchases the product from your shop tries it out, they're going to keep buying it because your coffee is just that good. So, here's an example of a sales fun. Let's say that someone sees you post on Facebook and you are basically talking about different types of coffee that they can consume and which type is best for which activity. They head on over to your post and are thoroughly bowled over.

[00:12:41.610] - Angela
Now, they are extremely interested in what you have to say. After reaching the end of your blog post, they notice that you're giving away seven whole coffee recipes in the form of an ebook for free.

[00:12:52.230] - Angela
So, what do they do? They enter their email address in order to get the freebie. Right. Then for the next seven days you are constantly giving them extremely valuable and educational emails related to coffee, how important it is and what type of beans they need to use in order to benefit from them. Right.

[00:13:11.370] - Angela
Towards the end of the email sequence, you talk about how your mornings would change with just a tweak in your morning coffee. So, you provide a link. They go over to your online store, buy a whole bag of coffee and they love it so much that they decide to buy two more bags of coffee. So, you've not just earned a customer, but you've made a few sales just from one person. Right.

[00:13:33.800] - Angela
So, how do you build a sales funnel? By working backwards, you analyze your core offer and then work backwards to construct a sales funnel. Build the lead magnet. Right. Now, imagine there are several people buying your coffee. There are several people downloading your lead magnet. How many sales can you make by just having created one sales funnel?

[00:13:56.530] - Angela
It's insane. Right. So, here's the breakdown. When the person sees the post on Google Search or Facebook and reads your blog post. This is the awareness stage.

[00:14:05.350] - Angela
The minute they sign up to receive your ebook, they're taking an interest. When they enter your email sequence and read your nurturing emails and are considering purchasing the product in the end, it is called a decision. And the second they purchase your product, it becomes an action. When they constantly tell you how much they love your product and then go on to buy four or five products to spread the message that your product is the best. You've just entered the retention stage.

[00:14:33.250] - Angela
They are now your brand ambassador. Right. So, here is how you build a sales funnel. You have to identify who your target audience is. This means if you are attracting the wrong traffic, no matter what you do, you are not going to convert the traffic. So, don't waste your time.

[00:14:52.400] - Angela
Don't waste your time trying to attract everyone because the chances of you converting these people into buyers is close to zero. For instance, if I wanted to sell a sketchbook, I would target artists, architects and designers. Why? Because these are people that are going to be using the sketchbook daily and I know that they will be interested in buying one at some point in time. Right.

[00:15:12.300] - Angela
So, let's say I was mapping out my customer journey for my traffic ebook where I teach people how to gain blog traffic. Right. So ,this is what I would write down as my target audience. Like these are the characteristics of the person who's going to buy. They'd be somewhere between their 20s to 50s.

[00:15:30.630] - Angela
They want to spend more time with their family, so they want to be spending more time with their family. So, they have already started blogs and need to grow them quickly. They want to help pay the bills. They are looking for a new nonsense traffic guide. They may be hanging out on blogs that talk about starting blocks or growing traffic, and they need their blogs to make at least $1,000 a month so that they can quit their jobs.

[00:15:55.030] - Angela
Right. This helps me understand what kind of posts I need to write in order to attract these kind of people. Okay. So, second, write scrumptious blog posts. So, when you are trying to write engaging content, you need to understand whom you're writing for. And this is where identifying your target audience comes into play. So, you can hop on over to a keyword tool like Ubersuggest and type in your competitors name from the search bar.

[00:16:24.270] - Angela
You will spot a trend in the top most content, and this will help you understand what kind of posts do well in your niche. Right. So, once you've done this, you need to write a really outstanding post. And it would be best if you could write something between 2000 to 5000 words, because this is what Google really terms as good quality content, and this will also help you rank on the front page for multiple keywords. Right. Your content should also make your readers want to stay on your blog for longer.

[00:16:58.100] - Angela
Okay.

[00:16:58.950] - Angela
So, it is definitely hard work, but try to do this with every blog post that you publish. Okay.

[00:17:09.390] - Angela
The third step is creating an irresistible lead magnet. So, now that you are writing extremely good blog posts, you also need to create a lead magnet, a lead magnet that is related to the blog post, and that is also related to the product that you are going to be giving your reader at the end, you're going to be selling to your reader at the end. So, this can be anything. This can be a product, can be an ecourse or ebook.

[00:17:37.470] - Angela
Or you can also be offering a service like your own service, your own freelancing services, anything. Right. And once you create your lead magnet, you can market them everywhere. You can put an opt in form on your homepage or about page. You can put it on the top and the bottom of all your blog posts.

[00:17:59.580] - Angela
You can also create pins for the lead magnet and then schedule it via tailwind or even just create pins and upload them to Pinterest. And then you can promote it on social media by including a lot of, you can also promote it on social media by including varying titles and then add it to your social media scheduling app. Step Four, set up a require or a limited time offer. So, this is a really nice way to get people to make a sort of mini commitment to your blog and get a taste of your product.

[00:18:33.940] - Angela
So, Tripwire is an irresistible, low price offer whose only purpose is to convert your audience into buyers. For instance, it is really easy to ask for a sale for $100 product at the end of the funnel when your leaders have already had a taste of your paid content.

[00:18:50.890] - Angela
Right? So, think of it like this. You walk into a shop and you see a very expensive bag of cookies. Branding is brilliant and you all you want to buy it. But you're worried that it may not taste as good as you believe.

[00:19:00.910] - Angela
So, you walk away. But what if there was a woman offering cookie samples and you got to taste the product? There is a very good chance that you are going to buy the bag now, right? So, a reader is usually directed to a trip wire after they have opted in for a freebie and the trip wire pages time. 

[00:19:19.880] - Angela
So, this urges the reader to make the purchase within the time limit that you've set on the page. Okay. Next, not to them with an automated email sequence. So, now that they have downloaded your lead magnet, they're going to get an email sequence that you have written out. Okay. And this is basically the path that introduces them to your product and then raises the desire for it.

[00:19:46.200] - Angela
There are loads of ways you can go about this. You can create an email quote that slowly brings awareness to the problem, and then you can show them how you have the solution and how it is the best. Finally, you need to lead them to a sales page that is extremely beautiful and that basically conveys to them what your product is and how it can help them. Right. So, here are a few ways to nail your sales page. You need to hook the reader in.

[00:20:17.800] - Angela
The first line is where you do this. The first line of the sales page should make the leader desire the product. Remove all distractions like headers and footers from the sales page because you don't want your leader getting distracted. It doesn't even need to have a Sidebar. Okay. Third, focus on the benefits of the product, not the features. Your reader doesn't want to know about the product.

[00:20:40.040] - Angela
They want to know how the product is going to help them become a better version of themselves or help them improve something like either make more money or lose more weight or gain clarity on your business. Save time, become more productive, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. Fourth, build credibility by including a bio that is completely you. So, your readers have already gotten a chance to know you via your email sequence.

[00:21:05.380] - Angela
But including a bio of yourself talking about yourself and how you have helped a lot of people achieve the result that you are promising in this product is going to make them trust you a little more. And if you can include a photo of yourself, brownie points for you. Right. Paint the picture of their lives once they purchase the product. So, you can talk about how their lives will change or how they will achieve a particular goal once they buy the product. This helps them paint a mental picture of all the positive effects of your product, and then you can include a bonus. Right.

[00:21:47.670] - Angela
So, I did this with my first two ebooks and I saw the difference it made when selling them. Seven include an easy checkout process. I use Send out when it comes to my ebooks and I use Teachable for my E courses because the checkout process is really easy and last follow up with your customers so that you can build brand loyalty. Right? So, how do you do this?

[00:22:14.420] - Angela
You can add a follow up sequence after a person has purchased from you. Okay. And you can even tag somebody, once a person has purchased from you via send out. And then the minute someone purchases the product, you can set up an automation for anyone who is tagged with that tag. And you can send it like ten to 20 days after they have purchased the product so that you are keeping in touch with them. You are touching base.

[00:22:41.320] - Angela
You are like, did you enjoy this product? You can ask them questions like that. You can also ask them to leave you a testimonial, or you can even ask them to take a short product survey. And the best way to get more responses is to offer them a freebie if they summit a testimonial. Right.

[00:23:01.050] - Angela
This is a very tiny thing that you can do, but trust me, it makes a huge difference.

[00:23:08.490] - Angela
And lastly, I want to give you a sales funnel workbook so that you can start building your own sales funnel. So, you can download the sales funnel workbook by clicking the button below and you can start building your own sales funnel. Right? Once you build your sales funnel, keep testing and tweaking it till it's flawless. That means pausing, measuring your results at every step. Checking if you're attracting the right kind of traffic, measuring the number of leads you're getting in a month compared to how many sales you're getting in that same month.

[00:23:42.190] - Angela
Right. And this is how you build a sales funnel. Okay. So, I wish you nothing but the best. And if you have any questions, please let me know by typing in the box.

[00:23:54.010] - Angela
I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope that you have a good idea on how to build a sales funnel for your blog. Thank you so much for watching in this video. I hope you have a great day. Bye.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, Ann Marie. Thank you so much for joining me today. I'm super pumped about your session, which is gonna be diving into Google Analytics, which I feel like people do not pay enough attention to. So welcome, first of all, and thank you.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:00:13]:
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to do it.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:16]:
Yeah. So can you just give us, like, a quick overview of what you're gonna cover today before we dive in?

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:00:20]:
Yes. We're gonna talk about how to use Google Analytics to come up with blog post topics that your audience is already asking you for so that you can instantly see that that return and a bump in your traffic.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:34]:
I like that. That's awesome. Alright. So, guys, Ann Marie O'Braskin is going to teach us this. Let's go ahead and dive in.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:00:43]:
So today, we're talking about how to know what your readers really want from you and where we can find that information. So I would love to see where you're watching from. If you're on Instagram, tag me in your stories, take a screenshot. Let me see what's outside of your window right now, or better yet, show me what you're drinking while you're watching. Right now, I'm drinking a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. So tag me in your stories at amelbraskan, and I'm excited to get to know you. I will DM you if you tag me, because I really wanna chat and see what you're what you're doing, what your blog is about, and what you're writing about. So today, you're going to learn about which tools you can and should be using to find out what your readers really want, which content actually helps you reach your real goals, and then how to know what your readers want from you.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:01:40]:
And I promise all of this is gonna be super actionable. I will share these slides, and I will share I have a couple of of extra things that I'm gonna share with you too. So don't worry about taking notes. Just maybe listen and and take it in first. Drop your questions in the comments and I will gladly answer any of them. So which tools can you use to discover all these things that we're we're gonna discover about our readers? There's a a couple of main categories. So there's Google Analytics. Google Analytics is the the one single tool.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:02:17]:
If you're only gonna use 1, use Google Analytics. Because by using Google Analytics effectively, you can really look at what actions people are taking on your blog, on your site, including purchases and all of those goals that we're gonna talk about. And then social media analytics, whatever channels you're on, most of them have analytics of some kind attached. So you're able to use this information for basic metrics that can give you really great information about what they want and what they're looking for. Digging into the social media analytics a little bit, Facebook insights, you can learn about your user activities, favorite content, and habits, things like that. Instagram insights is really helpful when we're looking at, not only the demographics of who's following us and who's seeing our content, but we can see which content our followers really love. We can see when they're online, which stories make them take action. So this is really powerful if you're looking to get replies from your stories, or if you're looking to get them to click through to your blog.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:03:30]:
Pinterest analytics. I'm sure a lot of you are using Pinterest. And now Pinterest analytics isn't as powerful as some of the other tools, but you can still see really great information like keywords that people are using in their search, because we know Pinterest is really like a visual search engine. We can see what their interests are and then generally we can track our progress as well, which is very helpful. Then for Twitter analytics, you can learn about the people that your content is reaching. You can learn about which content does best, what prompts the most engagement, that type of thing. So you can really see what you should continue to post on the platform. And then what should you be tracking? You're looking at all of these analytics and these insights, but I know that a lot of people can feel really overwhelmed by it because there's just so much information.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:04:28]:
So here I'm gonna break it down the 3 metrics that you need to go and get and then the five numbers that you need to be looking at. And if you look at nothing else, that's fine. You don't need to overwhelm yourself with this, but these five numbers are gonna tell you so much information and can really guide you in data driven decisions. So first, we really want to answer the question, where is my money coming from? I'm assuming that you are all blogging and you're all writing this content because Summit, it's driving you somewhere. Ultimately, you want to be making some sort of money with it. So we need to think about we need to think about what are the goals that are getting us to this money. So, for example, if if one of your goals is, sponsorships, then maybe you need to get your sessions up. You need to get your active readers that number as high as possible.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:05:33]:
So that's gonna be one of your goals, just to get more and more people reading the site. Now if you are, someone who maybe sells a product and you're blogging to get more people there, then one of your goals is going to be maybe opt ins, to get them on your email list. And then ultimately, you can also be tracking your purchases of a of a digital product or something like that. So once we have this list of these things, like where is your money coming from, This is gonna guide us with what we're tracking. So inside of each channel now a channel is is maybe a social media platform or your email list. Inside of each of those channels, we're gonna wanna measure these three things. We're gonna measure how many impressions your content is getting, how many sessions that content is driving to your site. This is eyeballs.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:06:30]:
How many people are reading your content, coming from this platform? And then goals, those goals that we spoke about. How many how many goals are these Right? Either purchases or readers or or opt ins, things like that. So impressions, this is how many times has content been viewed off of your website because what we're trying to find here is okay. Outside of the readers on Facebook, on Pinterest, on Instagram, how many people are seeing you who can then decide to come and read your blog. So that's one number that we wanna be tracking. Then we want to know, okay, how many times did people visit the site after seeing that content? So this is gonna be how many clicks and how many page views you got from Facebook, from Instagram, from your email list. You're tracking all of those things. As long as you have Google Analytics installed on your site, you're tracking these things and you may not even realize it.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:07:42]:
So that data is sitting there and waiting for you. And now goal conversions. Now these are these are the goals that are making you money or these are the many steps that are going to make you money. So how many times have these money making goals been completed from someone who came from one of those channels? And it's some I just love that we can track this because we can really put value to the time that we're spending on these on these sites. We wanna know how much money posting in Facebook groups is making us. How much money pinning 50 pins a week is is making us. You know what I mean? Like, obviously, we have the value of our time, but we wanna know what we're getting in return. What are we getting back from that? And is it ultimately worth the time we're spending on these platforms? And so these goals can be things like increased sessions, opt ins, or purchases, as we discussed.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:08:41]:
And it's not limited to this list. So, make sure you think about like, make a list. What are all the steps that someone can take before they become someone that makes you money? Whether that's a reader or whether that's someone who, like, purchases a course from you or, a principal, something like that. So I mentioned that you're gonna be grabbing three numbers, but you're gonna be tracking 5. So once you know those 3, then it's a little bit of math. But I promise I have a template here for you. I will link to it, and, it does the math for you. So I made it like a little calculator.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:09:24]:
So if you hate math, don't worry about it. But the 2 things that we're gonna be calculating are the click through rate of your content and then the conversion rate of your website. So I'm just gonna explain what each of those are. So the click through rate of your content, what this tells us is what percentage or how many people that saw your content clicked through. And the reason we wanna look at this number is because it helps us to understand if the content that we're we're putting out on social media so if, say, our Instagram posts are connecting emotionally, connecting with the people who are seeing it. Because if if our content that we're writing on social media is connecting with people, it should be driving clicks to the site because that's what we're trying to do. That's our goal. Now if we're if we're getting in front of a ton and a ton and ton of people and we're not getting clicks, it means that there's some sort of disconnect there.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:10:33]:
We have our audience who's following you. They they have some sort of interest in you. They they wanna know more about you. But then we have our content, and there's something there that's not jiving. We so what we can do there is if we see, say, we have a low click through rate, what we can do is we adjust that content so that we can give the audience what they're looking for. Because it's much easier for us to adjust what we're doing than it is to go out and find a whole new audience. Because I know you've spent so much time building these audiences. So don't don't make that wasted time.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:11:14]:
Just you can make some adjustments. And then in a similar idea, the conversion rate of your website is how many people that clicked through and got to your site, so this this audience on your website, versus and how many purchased. And so, again, we're looking at what the connection is and how good that connection is. So are we getting all of these people here with our content, but then they're not buying? That means there's something not quite connected between the content that we're putting on out on social that's attracting these people in. And there's something disconnected between what's attracting them and then what we're trying to sell them. So there's something out of alignment there. And these numbers can really tell us that. Our numbers can tell us if if we're if we're aligned with what our audience really wants or not.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:12:09]:
And the more that we track these things, the better we can see. We can look for trends. We can see if maybe a new type of content that we posted last week, like, really hit the mark. Because we'll be able to tell from these actual numbers from this data, and then that will make us money. So where do we find these numbers? I'm not just telling you, hey. You need to figure this stuff out. I'm gonna actually show you, step by step where you can get it. So you're gonna find it inside of these tools, inside of Google Analytics and inside of the social media analytics tools.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:12:43]:
So we're gonna jump in. Now in this example, I am just gonna show you Google Analytics and I'm gonna show you for your Facebook page. There are more, but it would just take a long time to go through it, but you'll get the idea, and, you'll be able to find on the other platforms as well. So for each of these metrics so remember the 3 that we wanna look at are the impressions, the sessions, and the goals. So for goals, we're gonna find those inside of Google Analytics, And I wrote down here where you're gonna find each one, but I also have a screenshot on following slides. Impressions, you're gonna find inside of the social media analytics tool of your choosing. So like I said, I'm gonna use Facebook insights as my example here. And then sessions, you're also gonna find in that same place inside of Google Analytics.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:13:34]:
So you're really only going to 2 places to find these 3 metrics to then ultimately have those find. So here, this is a a look inside of Google Analytics, and I highlighted here exactly where you're gonna find each one. So on the left hand side, you can see acquisition. That's where the people are coming from. Then you're gonna go into channels, And in each of these, you can see you're gonna see how many sessions and how many goal completions you have inside each one. And this breaks it out by the default channel grouping. And if you're just getting started, leave it like that and just see. You can see it's broken out for organic search, that's your Google search.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:14:17]:
Direct traffic, referral traffic, that's when other blogs or other websites are linking to you. And then your social traffic and then this one has affiliates. If you click on social, you can actually break that out further, which I know is is gonna be really important. So then it's the same information, looks the same, but you can see the social network here. That's broken out. Now for impressions or reach, so I was talking about about a lot about impressions or eyeballs. So impressions and reach are 2 different things, But the reason that I'm going with reach for Facebook insights is because it's easiest to find. It's the easiest to find when you're look when you go to your Facebook page and then click on insights, it's right there.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:15:16]:
And I'm all about making things as easy as possible for ourselves. So here, you can track the post reach. And so you can see here, when I pulled this data, the week before it had reached 750. So when you enter into Google Analytics, you'll see something that looks something similar to this. And in the left hand column here, you're gonna wanna go to acquisition, all traffic, and channels. Now this is where you're gonna get the main overview of all of your channel traffic and what the traffic from each of these channels is doing on your site. Now I do wanna point out we're gonna wanna pay attention to what this date range is. I like to look at at least 3 months in the past, if we're looking at this for the first time.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:16:08]:
If we're looking at it once a week, then we just wanna look at the last week, things like that. So let's look at the last 3 months, and we're gonna look at what the traffic from each of these channels did. Now remember, what we're trying to find here are the number of sessions that came from each of these channels. So you can see here social the social channel brought 259 sessions, referral traffic brought 76 sessions, and organic search brought 14 sessions. Now over in the right hand column here, we spoke about goals before and we're gonna wanna make sure that the the conversions we're tracking are all goals instead of ecommerce. Ecommerce tends to be the default, so you really wanna pay attention to what it's showing you. And so this is where we can really see what the most valuable channels are for you because you can see which ones are bringing you the most goal completions. And if you do have goal values attached, I don't obviously in this view, but if you have goal values attached in this far right column, you'll be able to see the actual dollar amount that each of these channels brings you during that time period.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:17:28]:
And that's just so valuable to see. Now if you click right here on this link where it says social oh, no. Okay. That was an error. So if you click on that link where it says social, what it does is it breaks out each of the social channels. So you can see that most of my traffic that comes from social comes from Facebook, then after that it's it's Instagram, and this is based on the number of sessions. And you can see also that Google is starting to break out Instagram and Instagram stories, and that's a very new thing. So that's pretty interesting.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:18:07]:
And you can also see how many goal completions each of those channels channels had. And so what you really wanna pay attention to here, when we when we plug these numbers into the calculator and it spits out the conversion rate, this is what we're really looking for. Because as you can see here, for each of these channels so Facebook and Instagram, obviously, they have huge differences in the number of sessions that they they bring to my site. So, for example, Facebook brought 223 sessions during this time frame and Instagram only brought 24 sessions, but they had the exact same number of goal completions. And look at this goal conversion rate. Facebook has a 4% goal conversion rate. That means that 4% of the people coming from Facebook are converting in some way on my site, but over 37% of the people coming from Instagram are converting. So what does that mean? Let's just take a step back for a second and think about what that means for us.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:19:20]:
What are what are we gonna do with this information? Once we're tracking the the impressions and the sessions and the goals and then the click through rates and the conversion rates. When we know that conversion rate, we know which channel is the most important for us to start driving traffic to. So you can see here, like, Facebook is driving the same number of conversions as Instagram, but, oh my gosh, Instagram is driving it it has a conversion rate of over 37%. So what am I gonna do? I'm gonna start working harder on Instagram, trying to get people to go from Instagram to my site. Do you see what I mean here? This is how we can use this data to really to really guide what we're doing with our strategy. And now from here so this is how we get those first those first conversion numbers. Those first session numbers. This is where we find it inside of Google Analytics.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:20:25]:
And then when we're looking at when we wanna go into Google search console, this is what we're gonna look for here. So inside of Google search console, like I said, this is a different tool, but it is so helpful to look at what people are doing from the outside. So if, if you're getting a good amount of traffic from organic search, please install Google search console onto your site because it can give you so much more information. So here you can see so this is the overview. This is just where you get to right when you right when you log in. And then in performance here, this is where I'm gonna open the report. So you can see here the total impressions I had were over 3,000. That means that people are searching and my website is coming up 3,000 times.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:21:21]:
And what this is telling me is that there's so much opportunity here. People are seeing me 3,000 times, so why am I not getting 3,000 clicks? Let's do something to change that. So here you can you can scroll down here and you can see the search queries, and that's just a fancy sounding word for the words that people are typing into Google, and see how many how many impressions my links are getting. So you can see here, Pinterest scheduler, it got 685 impressions. That means that it was this that my website was seen 685 times when someone searched plug that in. And so what can we do with this information? When we see this, when we can see what people are searching for and what we're already showing up for, And when we know that, we can use these keywords, these search queries, plug them into our site in a very organic manner, use them to write more blog posts, to use that as topics for our content, things like that because it's gonna make it so much easier for us to rank and start getting those clicks when we have these topics. And so you can see here also if you click on pages, you can look at the actual URLs, like the actual blog posts that are getting these impressions and you can see how many times they're showing versus how many clicks they're getting. So and you can look at a couple of other things here, but but really what I wanna the most important thing to look at here, I think, is the query section.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:23:05]:
Use these as keywords for your future blog posts. If if they're, you can see like like this one, I showed up for Twitter ads consulting. Now I offer Twitter ads, but I don't really go into that a lot on my site. But I can see that I showed up 63 times for that. So what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go to my services page and I'm gonna write out a little bit more and say, hey. Yeah. I can run your Twitter ads for you. Here's what it means.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:23:33]:
Here's what I can do for you. And you can see here also so, let's see another one that jumps out to me. Ideal client worksheet. Awesome. I showed up 280 times or people saw me 280 times. So if I do a little bit of work on a page where I have an ideal client worksheet, then I'm just gonna start seeing more clicks and getting more people, for an opt in, on my email list, and then ultimately driving for conversions. So you see how you can really use this information. Turn it into your blog posts and get the get the people who are already seeing you to start clicking.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:24:15]:
So I hope that's really helpful. Let me know if you have any questions about how you actually access this information. But, I can include the links here for how to install Google Analytics and how to install Google Search Console because I think they're both extremely valuable tools. Okay. So now we know all of this. We're we're using the data. We're seeing which platforms are driving traffic. We're seeing which content people are liking based on how many impressions that are being, given to each post and then what the click through rate is.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:24:57]:
But we're gonna take it one step further. So this is we're getting a little bit more advanced here, but it's not too bad. But here, we're gonna see what your readers are already asking you for more of, what they already are showing with their actions, not just by what they're saying to you. But, I mean, obviously, listening to them is important, but you've all heard the expression, actions speak louder than words. So let's look at what they're doing, and we can identify what they actually want. So we're gonna look at what they're already searching because these are their actions.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:41]:
We can

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:25:41]:
look at the top landing pages inside of your website. Now a landing page, that's the first place that they get to on your website. And so this means that one way or another they could have searched for it on Google, they could have clicked through from a website, from an email, from anything like that, But this these are the pages that are attracting. This is the attractive content to people. So look at your top pages. See if there's one topic that really stands out that is doing that's attracting way more people than other than other topics. Because that's something that you can start to create more of. And assuming that their behavior continues similarly, you'll be able to bring in more traffic and get more goals by those top landing pages, that attractive content.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:26:31]:
And one thing that you do really wanna look at is if look at those top landing pages and make sure that those pages are driving people to complete the goals or the actions that that you want them to take. So, for example, if you have an opt in that you know drives people to your email list and then they purchase something from you, then make sure that that opt in is on those top landing pages. You see what I mean? We just wanna make it as easy as possible for people to to take the actions and complete the goals that we want. Just make it seamless. Make it easy for them. There's no need to make it difficult. Then we're also gonna look at, search terms. So inside of Google Analytics, you're gonna look at what people are searching for internally on your site.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:27:26]:
So if you have a search bar excuse me. If you have a search bar, we're gonna just look at the terms that people are plugging in there because that can give you a really good idea. It's something we can the information we can find from this is, one, do you have content already that maybe is a little tricky to find? Or maybe do you just need to adjust the phrasing? That can be a really easy way to get more traffic. And then if there's topics that people are searching for that they think if they're searching for it on your site, they think you're some sort of expert in it. They think you have that information. So give them that information as long as you have it. And then search performance. This is this is the spot where it gets a little bit more advanced just because we're using an an additional tool that you may need to install on your blog, But by using Google search console, we can see the top pages that are appearing in search, and then the phrases that people were using in the search bar, and then we can see how many times people clicked to get to your site.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:28:30]:
So what we wanna see here, what we're looking for here is what people are searching for that we're getting impressions on, that your site is showing up in search results for, and how can we you can then go and you can you can use the phrases that people are already typing into Google, and we're gonna use that to create blog topics, we're gonna use that for our keywords, we're gonna use that to create, our subject, like, our our our titles for our blog posts, that type of thing. So we're just trying to use here the information that we have that's already readily available to us, and I should I should clarify this. All of this is free. All of all of these tools are free. You just need to install them on your site. And the best part about it is that we're not trying to we're not making people do anything. We're just working along the path that they're already taking. We're making things easier for them.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:29:35]:
We're literally giving them what they're already asking for, and it just makes it better for everyone. So that's what I love about this. About data and analytics, we can we're using the information that's there. We're helping people find what they want, and we're looking at these these actions versus what people think that they want. So if you have any questions, please ask. I'm here in the chat. And, if you're watching this afterwards, after the live, live viewing of it, please feel free to send me a message, shoot me a message on Instagram. I'm on all the socials.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:30:20]:
I also have a data and drinks Facebook group. Just type that into the search bar. And then data makes money is my program, where you can take this all a bunch of steps further to just continue to use data to help your audience get what they want and just make things as easy as possible while you're spending less time on your marketing, because we're just we just knock off all those things on your marketing to do list that aren't working so you can get your time back and ultimately make more money. Feel free to send me an email, annmarie@amobraskin.com. I'm so excited. Thank you so much for having me here Right, and please let me know if you use this, if what you got from it, and if you're gonna go and start implementing any of these ideas that we spoke about today. So thank you so much, and have a wonderful day.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:13]:
That was fantastic. I need to go dig into my Google Analytics some more for sure. Thank you.

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:31:20]:
Yeah. Thank you so much. I had so much fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:23]:
Any final words for our attendees? I know you've got a freebie below that we're linking to, but what anything else you wanna kinda wrap up with?

Ann Marie O'Braskin, The Marketing Moms [00:31:30]:
I just wanted to really, emphasize that digging into your data, it's so helpful because it's all already there and so much of it is free. So just go in, take your time, learn about it, and when you know what your audience is already asking you for, it makes your life so much easier.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:50]:
Yeah. You don't need super fancy tools to figure this stuff out. You can there's there's free ones. You should go learn to use them, and with Ann Marie, you'll

Liz Stapleton [00:31:57]:
be there in no time.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:58]:

[00:00:09.960] - Eden Fried, edenfried.com
Hey, everybody, welcome to the master class. Today, we are talking all about how to turn your new leads into instant customers with a Tripwire Offer. If you're not familiar with what a Tripwire Offer is or with who I am, don't worry. I'm going to cover all the basics. But first, I want to say thank you so much for joining me at the Summit presentation. I feel really honored to have been asked to be here to talk about one of my favorite topics of all time, and really honored that you have decided to join me today.

[00:00:41.170] - Eden
So, let's start with this. I want you to imagine this scenario. You get a new subscriber to sign up to your email list. Now, first of all, that's a win in of itself, right? That's amazing when someone signs up to your email list. Now, imagine that instantly, right after they sign up, you offer them a low cost digital product for just nine dollars. That's it. Really low cost, low barrier for entry product, just nine dollars.

[00:01:08.310] - Eden
And they see the offer. They feel like it's absolutely perfect for them. So, they instantly grab their credit card and they go ahead and make a purchase. How amazing would that be? Now, I know nine dollars doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you haven't made any money online yet, this process sounds amazing, doesn't it? And this is what a trip wire is. Of course, there's more to the process. We are going to go in and cover all of the details.

[00:01:35.430] - Eden
But for now, what I want you to know is that Tripwires can truly revolutionize your business without requiring a ton of effort on your part. There are lots of ways to make money from your website, but I'm sure you've heard of lots of them. Not many of them are as easy as making money with a Tripwire. And that's why I'm personally in love with this method and love teaching it to people, because it's a great way to start to monetize your site with really passive income effort.

[00:02:03.390] - Eden
It's really nice to meet you if you're not familiar with me. And my name is Eden Fried. A quick background about me. Back in 2016, I quit my job and I bailed on my plan to go to law school. I started a blog the very next day with the goal of hopefully being able to make money online. I had bailed on law school. I had dodged the bullet a quarter million dollars of debt. But I needed to figure out how I was going to make money and I wasn't happy in my day job. So, I tried a million one things to figure out how to make money online. I tried freelancing affiliate marketing sponsorships, like you name it. I tried it at some point.

[00:02:39.690] - Eden
Eventually I discovered digital products and within a few days of launching my first online course, I made over five hundred dollars, which quickly turned into a thousand dollars, which turned into fifteen hundred dollars. And you know what it really snowballed from there. And here I am now, years later, still in the digital product world, because I guess you could say I drank the Kool-Aid and I never looked back. And these are a few of the things that you can find me doing these days.

[00:03:07.590] - Eden
I am the host of the Rebel Boss podcast, where I interview lots of women who are creating and selling digital products and have really great strategies to help them launch. I'm the host of the founder and host of The Rebel Boss Virtual Summit, which is a virtual Summit focused on digital product launch strategies. That happens two times a year. I'm also the founder of Rebel Boss University, which teaches my 90-day launch format to get your product launched in a 90-day time frame. And Edenfried.Com is kind of the home for everything where you can find my Podcast, you can find free information, blogs, everything, all about digital product launch strategy. So, that's a little bit about who I am and what I do online.

[00:03:50.700] - Eden
Now, I'm going to leave you with this. I think this is a great place to really dive in. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60 to 70%. I want you to really let that sink in for a second, 60 to 70%. That's crazy. That means that your goal should be, how can I turn my leads into customers as fast as possible? If you know that once someone buys something from you once, they're statistically very likely to buy from you again, your goal should be, how can I get these people to buy as fast as humanly possible?

[00:04:23.730] - Eden
How can I get them from A to B, thinking about buying to actually making the sale? And that's why you need to set up a Tripwire or or else you're really risking leaving money on the table. And I'm saying that it sounds maybe  sounds a little bit blunt. It is blunt, but I really mean this. If you do not have Tripwires set up on your website, you are 100% leaving money on the table because tripwires are the tool that will get your customer from thinking about buying to buying within a split second within just a few minutes time. And there's really nothing else out there quite like this that's going to help your customers or your potential customers become actual customers within a few minutes.

[00:05:07.530] - Eden
All right. So, let's start with. Part one, talking about the foundations of Tripwires, here are the core ingredients for a successful Tripwire: First of all, they're going to be low cost. They're usually between 9 to 20 dollars. Now, I have seen trip wires that are more expensive than this. I have tested trip wires myself that are more expensive than this. But I'm going to just be honest with you, if this is the very first time you're messing around with trip wires, just stick to the bread and butter, stick to what works, okay? Nine to twenty dollars is going to be a sweet spot. Honestly, it should be more like 19.19 because 19 is going to sell more than 20 dollar product.

[00:05:45.230] - Eden
Your Tripwire really has to scratch the itch of a pain point. So, products, digital products, if they're going to sell, they need to solve a problem. Okay, products are just really resolutions to problems. So, if they don't solve a pain point, if they don't scratch the itch of a pain point, nobody's going to want to bite. Right. There needs to be a sense of urgency. People buy because they're scared of missing out on a great deal. I think about Black Friday buyers, any kind of Memorial Day sale, things like that. There's a sense of urgency to purchase before you miss out on a really great deal. And that's what makes a Tripwire really successful, because you are going to be including a timer and limited time, low pricing. And the combination of those two things. It really helps people make a purchase decision very quickly. Your product also needs to give people a quick win. It's not just about collecting the money. Right. Making that nine dollars is great. But you want to wow people with your products, you don't want them to get your product and then feel disappointed that they bought it because then they'll never buy from you again. You want to make sure that your product actually is giving them a quick win. Now, I don't mean to say that you have to give everything right, but you need to give them some kind of quick win.

[00:06:59.210] - Eden
So, here's why tripwires really work: the price is right. It's why not pricing or easy. Yes, pricing. It's so low. So it's like, why not? Right. They're looking at this offer. It's low cost. There's a timer. They're scared of missing out on the deal. It's something that they actually need and they're worried they're going to miss out. So, they're like, ""Okay, let me just go get my credit card really quickly."" I'm not going to lie to you. I purchased Tripwires many times myself, which is what motivated me to actually go ahead and get them set up for my site because it worked on me. And I've I remember laying in bed at night. It was like 11:30 PM. My husband is snoozing away next to me. I'm scrolling away on my phone mindlessly. I see an ad on Facebook- and you don't have to run ads to this, by the way. But this is where it happened to see it- I saw an ad on Facebook, I clicked on it, signed up for a Lead Magnet, immediately saw a Tripwire and I bought it and I literally got out of bed. And it takes a lot to get me out of that. Right. I got out of that and I got my wallet, put my credit card information and I bought a Tripwire at night. And that's when I knew, okay, I need to figure out how to make this happen to.

[00:08:07.190] - Eden
Now, let me just tell you this. You are not about to get rich off of Tripwire is now you. We talked about the low pricing already nine to nineteen dollars that you know, that's great to make that money. But the goal is not to get rich off of it and you will not get rich off of it. Okay, so your goal with the Tripwire isn't to make money, but there are lots of other amazing benefits to making one.

[00:08:28.880] - Eden
So, first of all, it's going to turn your leads into customers fast. Right. Which means they're likely to buy again. If they're 60 to 70 percent likelihood that they're going to buy from you again because they've already bought from you in the past, then if you can turn them into your customers fast you won, if that's all this would do, it would be worth it. But there's more benefits to tripwires. The earnings that you can get from a Tripwire can cover the cost of your expenses.

[00:08:52.370] - Eden
So, think about the tools that you're paying for on a monthly or annually basis. Maybe you're paying for an email service provider or, I don't know, storage on your computer or lots of other kinds of things that you might be paying for. You might be able to break even or even make a little bit of profit on this. You can cover the cost of your ad spend. And that is huge, because when you can cover the cost of your ad spend, you have an opportunity to infinitely scale your business.

[00:09:20.900] - Eden
Now, I'm just going to preface this by saying I'm not going to be talking about ad spend in this particular training. And you also do not need to ever drop a dime on ads if you don't want to. Okay, so I went five years of my business or four and a half years of my business without ever investing in a single Facebook or Instagram ad and totally doing fine financially.

[00:09:41.420] - Eden
It wasn't until I had the right offer for an ad type offer or funnel that I decided to go ahead and dive into Facebook ads and it wasn't with the Tripwire. So don't listen to this training thinking, ""Oh my gosh, Eden is going to tell me I need to run Facebook ads"", because that's absolutely not the case. This process is something you can do and you can make money with without touching any Facebook ads or Instagram ads or any kind of ads.

[00:10:09.070] - Eden
And another big win is that you are giving your customers a quick win, and that is important because you are now establishing the know, like and trust factors which are absolutely necessary to get your customers excited to buy from you again and again and again.

[00:10:26.620] - Eden
So, part two, how do we actually go about setting up a Tripwire? In order to go through this process? I want you to understand what a funnel actually looks like, and then we'll dive into where Tripwires fit into this.

[00:10:38.110] - Eden
So, your job online is to get as many people, as many qualified people, I should say, over to your website. So, you know, whatever you're doing on social media or wherever else it may be, you are strategically promoting your content so that they land on your website. Then you are hopefully getting people from just viewing your website to actually signing up for your email list with a lead magnet. Once they signed up for your lead magnet, they've gotten whatever free goodies you've given them. They're now on your email list, which means you have that opportunity to develop that know, like and trust factor and really nurture them with quality email content that will hopefully get them primed and ready to buy your more expensive product from you down the line. Now, obviously, there are more people going into the funnel than coming out of the funnel, but the goal is at the end of the funnel to have customers actually making a purchase.

[00:11:32.770] - Eden
So, where does a Tripwire fit into this process? Right here. So, it's an opportunity for you to make money before you would have made money. So, you don't have to wait to the end of the funnel. Now you have another mini funnel setup, so you get people over to your site, same process. You get them on to your email list with a lead magnet. But right here is where you offer them the trip wire you right after they sign up for that ledman will direct them to a trip wire sales page.

[00:12:00.060] - Eden
Now, here's another way of looking at it. For those people who are more linear and a visual learner, again, you're getting people to your site with strategic promotional strategies, SEO social media. You're getting them over to your site, on to your email list with a lead magnet now there on your email list and eventually you can pitch them your core product. Another way of doing it is immediately from the lead magnet you offer them the Tripwire offer and now they're on your email list and you will give them your core product offer pitch later on. Okay.

[00:12:33.460] - Eden
So, works like this, you get targeted traffic to your website. You convert that traffic to your email list with a freebie or lead magnet, whatever you call it, and then instantly send those new leads to a tripwire sales page.

[00:12:47.890] - Eden
So, here are some of the things that you need to make this happen: Now, obviously, you're going to need a tripwire product. You need a timer software. You're going to need a sales pitch. But it doesn't have to be a crazy long sales page like you're probably familiar with. And you need a payment processor, obviously, to collect those dollars.

[00:13:04.840] - Eden
So, the product we talked about this already, but it's worth mentioning, again, the product that you're offering needs to solve the pain point or it at least needs to scratch the itch of the pain point, meaning start to solve the problem.

[00:13:17.560] - Eden
It also needs to make sense in the grand scheme of things. So, it needs to make sense in your funnel. It needs to build on your freebie and it needs to lead to your end product. Okay. So, I'm going to give you an example here. Let's say you are a Facebook ads marketing expert. Your freebie might be a Facebook ads, checklists, use a checklist for all the things that you need to do before you hit publish on your first Facebook ads campaign. The Tripwire might be a mini course on setting up your first Facebook ad campaign and with video to go along with it so that you're not confused. Everybody has all the information that they need.

[00:13:50.980] - Eden
This example I put in here, because this is an example of a Tripwire that I actually did go ahead and purchase. This is the one I purchased like 11:30 at night. So, yeah, you can see here how the Tripwire builds on the freebie. And now you can imagine that at the end of this funnel there's going to be a more expensive product related to running Facebook ads. So, do you see how it makes sense in the grand scheme of things? The Tripwire is not just a random product. It actually builds on the previous step in the funnel.

[00:14:20.560] - Eden
Another example is a freebie. The freebie could be a list of dangerous home cleaning products for babies. So, if you have a little baby at home, you're worried that the cleaning products you're using might be toxic for your new crawler. You would download this freebie and then the Tripwire would be a DIY recipe book with homemade cleaning products, nontoxic baby, safe cleaning products. So, maybe if you're worried about the cleaning products that you're using at home, you might be interested in making your own cleaning products and you might buy this recipe eBook that helps you make your own non-toxic cleaning products. So, it builds on the previous step in the funnel. It makes sense in the grand scheme of things.

[00:14:59.560] - Eden
Both of these tripwires are scratching the edge of a main pain point. This Tripwire is not going to solve all of your problems when it comes. To starting Facebook ads, right. You're still going to have questions, you're not going to have all the answers that you need, but it's starting to scratch the itch, right? You're starting to get the information you need to feel more confident. And this is obviously going to build that. No, like a trust factor in the same thing is true for this example.

[00:15:27.820] - Eden
Okay, so the format of your Tripwire product is really not the most important thing that I wanted to give you some options. Here is your trip wire can be in the form of an eBook. It can be templates, it can be a bundle of resources. It really can be anything. Swipe, copy graphics and mini course. It could be a full course. It could be something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet. Your imagination is the only limiting factor when it comes to deciding what format your Tripwire is going to take.

[00:15:54.490] - Eden
When you're deciding on the format. I encourage you to consider what you like to make. If it's going to take you forever to make a mini course and don't make a mini course. But if you're really great at writing and it's going to take you a day to write an eBook, then go ahead and make an e-book. The other consideration here is what does your target customers prefer? Do they hate eBooks, but love courses? While if that's the case, you might want to create a course. Do they love graphics but hate something else? Well make that a consideration. When you're deciding pricing, it has to be discounted from something higher.

[00:16:26.890] - Eden
Okay. So, we talked about the low cost pricing, $19.19, but there's really no sense of urgency to buy a $9 product when it's always nine dollars. Right. So, it really needs to be $9 discounted from something more expensive, like twenty five or thirty five or forty five, something like that.

[00:16:45.850] - Eden
You want to avoid pricing like 16 or 18 because 18 feels like more than 15. 16 feels like more than 15. Think about it this way. A $19 product is probably going to sell more than a $16 dollar product, even though the $19 product is more expensive because the $16 product sounds like it's more than 15, but the $19 product sounds like it's less than 20. So, think about the psychology behind pricing.

[00:17:14.020] - Eden
Another thing that you can consider is adding in what's called an Order Bump to make more money. Okay, now we talked about this already that the goal with your trip wire isn't necessarily to make money. There's lots of other benefits to get a new customer being the number one benefit. But that being said, you can still, like we said, cover the cost of your expenses, cover the cost of your ad spend if you choose to go that route. Lots of things that you can do with these earnings. So, if you want to squeeze more juice out of the scale and sale, if you want to increase the order value, you can add what's called an Order Bump.

[00:17:49.600] - Eden
Now, you've probably seen Order Bumps before on checkout forms. So somebody's already checking out. You've already decided you're going to purchase. You're putting in your name, your address, your credit card information, and you're literally about to press buy when you see this flashing box that says, ""Wait, do you want to add this to your order?"" And it's usually just a paragraph, maybe a picture where it says, ""Here's what this is, it's only 19 additional dollars. Check this box to add it to your purchase."" That's what an order bump is. It's bumping up the value of the order.

[00:18:22.990] - Eden
Okay, make sure to visibly display the massive discount. So, don't assume that people know it's discounted to 9 from 29. Right. Don't assume that people know that. You want to make sure that people see that it's discounted. So, usually I would do it's $9 with a big 29 in red font crossed off with an X through it.

[00:18:44.470] - Eden
So people visualize the massive discount that's included here. Okay, timer software, you absolutely should do everything you can in your power to have a timer on this page that's visible, because this is one of those factors that's going to help people visualize that there is urgency here, that if they don't make a purchase decision now, that the offer is going to go away, and they're not going to be able to find it again. Okay, I recommend finding a timer and setting it between 12 to 20 minutes. Usually I'll do fifteen minutes. But honestly, it depends on how long my sales page is. You want to make sure that your timer gives people enough time to actually go through the content on the sales page, because if you have a crazy long sales page and a ten minute timer, for example, you're just going to be giving people a sour taste in their mouth and they're going to be frustrated. So, you want to make sure that you balance out the timer with the content on the page, but you don't really want to go more than twenty minutes. And I would say 15 is the sweet spot.

[00:19:41.440] - Eden
You also want to make sure that the timer actually does something. It should expire the page to a, ""Sorry, this offer expired page."" It should make sure that that page with the offer is no longer available. If that timer hit zero and nothing happens and people see that nothing happened, you've now lost the trust of your potential customer, and they're probably not going to believe you again when you offer them something else with the timer in the future. You want to make sure that the timer actually does, in fact, expire the offer some options for you.

[00:20:13.460] - Eden
Deadline Funnel is my personal favorite. I use it for a Tripwires. I use it for my, like, open closed kart launches for products that I launch throughout the year. I use it for my Summit. I use it literally for everything. It is a little bit of investment, not so much. It's like a monthly cost or something. And there is a free trial, but I highly recommend trying it out. It's really robust and also simple to use, which is a powerful thing when you can find a tool that can do a lot and not be complicated to use; that's that's my kind of tool.

[00:20:45.380] - Eden
Another option would be page expiration robot or evergreen countdown timers. These are free or almost free options that you can check out, and explore whether or not they're going to be right for you, and the tools that you are using. But whatever tool you ultimately decide to go with, make sure that you have a timer, make sure the timer is displayed on the page and make sure the timer does, in fact expire the page, so it's no longer available.

[00:21:11.720] - Eden
The sales page is what we would call a Short Form Sales Page. So we're not talking about having a massive long sales page like you would see for a thousand dollar online course. This is a nine or nineteen dollars somewhere in between product. So, people don't need to have a crazy amount of information in order to make a purchase decision. You want to give them the information that they need and really nothing more. Okay, so that's going to include a headline, a sub headline. You're going to get the timer. I include mock up graphics. I want to make sure that I have that price discount visually. Explain on that page. I explain the features and most importantly, the transformation the product's going to provide. I like to include testimonials and definitely, definitely, definitely include a buy now button. And make sure that buy now button, actually does connect to the checkout page. You'd be surprised how many people forget something like this when I review their Tripwire sales pages. So yeah, this is really all you need on your sales page, your payment processor.

[00:22:09.110] - Eden
Again, the buy now button needs to actually be connected to a checkout page. There are lots of options for you to use when you are thinking about how can I collect payment? Teachable is great. Sendowl is great. Whatever you already have probably will work in some capacity. I don't recommend that you use a PayPal button. A PayPal button is very glitchy. It doesn't look that great. And PayPal often times out, which means that you are going to be losing out on sales most definitely if you are exclusively using a PayPal button. So, avoid that temptation. Trust me, I've had people say, ""Oh, I'm not going to listen to you, I'm just going to try it."" And they try it and they're like, ""Why did I do that?"" And they say, I should've listened you in the first place. I've tried this before. You guys learn from my mistakes and other people's mistakes. It doesn't work that well, not for a Tripwire, at least.

[00:22:56.570] - Eden
And then finally, the payment success needs to actually trigger immediate delivery of the Tripwire. This is really important because it's frustrating for somebody when they buy a product that and then they don't actually get immediate delivery of that product. So, make sure that when someone buys, they within a few minutes time will receive access to the product that they just purchased.

[00:23:18.380] - Eden
So, I wanted to share some examples of Tripwire sales pages that I used in the very beginning of my journey. And the reason why I shared these pages with you, is because they are definitely not perfect. However, they worked very, very well. I had extremely high conversion rates for all these Tripwire sales pages, which is why I wanted to show them to you, because mine have evolved a lot since then. But these imperfect sales pages have performed really well, and they're also a great learning opportunity for you.

[00:23:47.720] - Eden
So, this was for a Tripwire called the Email Hack for Bloggers. Now, the incentive to purchase this is that it was going to save you hours and hours worth of time with growing your emails. So, that's that was kind of the value incentive of purchasing. So, this is part of the sales page here. I highlight the transformation. So, it's going to save you 40 hours of work time; that's crazy. Here's a buy now button. I show the options for them to make a purchase. They can use Visa, whatever this is MasterCard, I think, PayPal. I included a graphic mock up. You can make something like this really easily. And Canva. A graphic mockups are really amazing to again, visualize for your potential customer what they're going to get when they make a purchase and what it's going to look like for them.

[00:24:39.320] - Eden
And yep. So, here are some testimonials here. Here's another Tripwire again. Here's a great example of how you can visualize or help people visualize the discount. So, it's usually sixty five. You can get it now for just $9 and roll now for just nine. And here's the value incentive here. You can get your-your sales funnel setup together in the next 30 minutes. I included instead of a graphic mock up on this page, I included an entire two and a half minute tour, so people could actually watch the video in two and a half minutes and see what they're going to get.

[00:25:16.850] - Eden
And then this is another Tripwire where my first ever Rababah Summit is actually a trip. This is from two years ago, the Rababah Summit. And people, can they have 15 minutes to decide whether or not they're going to pay $12 to get the 25 recorded trainings.

[00:25:35.210] - Eden
So, yeah, you can see that my Tripwire sales pitches have evolved stylistically over time. But I personally really love this simplistic format here where you can highlight, here's what's included. Here's a graphic mockup. Here's the button. And then, you can also make sure that you are including the timer like it was right here and other features as well. But this is the core of what you need. And typically, I would actually also include a timer like right above the button or maybe right here so people can see the timer with the buy now button, all the features, the mock up, it's kind of all in this little square.

[00:26:12.650] - Eden
Okay, so part three, does it work? And some next steps for you. Now, I know it's really hard to to to be patient with this process. I've had people stress out that their Tripwire isn't working or it's not working the way they expected it to be working. Let me just tell you this right now, up front at the beginning: You can't analyze the success of a tripwire until you've had at least two hundred people sign up for your lead magnet, actually view the offer. Anything less than that, and you just don't have a good sample size. It's like saying, you know, I've had people actually say, ""Oh, my gosh, my Tripwire is not working."" And I'll ask them, ""How many people saw your lead magnet and saw the actual tripwire offer."" And they'll say, ""Ten. Okay, well, I'm really sorry, but ten is just not a big enough sample size to know whether or not this is going to work in the long run. It's just not enough people."" And I totally get that. It might take you a while to get to 200. I get it. And that can be frustrating.

[00:27:10.790] - Eden
You know, I remember when I was building my email list in the very beginning, it felt like it took forever to get that first hundred people and then two hundred people. It does, it does take some time, but you do need to be patient. Marketing is all about data and it's all about making decisions based on the data. It's not about emotions. As much as you might feel like something is a failure or you might feel frustrated because it's not working. The fact of the matter is the numbers will tell you whether or not it's working- not your emotions, your emotions are just that emotion. So, put them to the side. Don't think about them, journal about them if you want to, talk to a therapist about them, if you want to. But it's all going to come down to the numbers.

[00:27:50.660] - Eden
Okay, so here's the math. What you're going to do is you're going to take the number of Tripwire customers that you have, divided by the number of people who signed up for your freebie or lead magnet. You're going to take that number and multiply it by 100. So, let's say you had 80 people buy out of 300 sign ups. You're going to point two six times one hundred. That's a 26% conversion rate. That's crazy, right? That's crazy high.

[00:28:16.910] - Eden
Now, let me just go back here and say industry standard conversion rate for a Tripwire can traditionally be more or higher than standard conversion rate for something like an online course or something that's more expensive. So keep that in mind. 26% is a number that you could expect, okay, that I can tell you from my personal experience that some of my trip wires have converted over 30%. So, you can expect to have higher numbers. That being said, if you don't have numbers as high as 26%, 30% or even 20% or 15 %, don't panic because standard conversion rate in most industries is going to be between four to seven percent, okay, and four is even high. Some is one to seven percent. But I would say four for a lot of industries. Okay. So, just keep that in mind because trip wires are lower price on the spectrum of products that are sold online, you can and probably should expect a little bit of a higher conversion rate than a more expensive course or other type of products sold online. But if you end up having a 10 percent conversion rate. You don't need to go crying and freaking out that it's not working because that's fine. All right. So, there is a big range here. That being said, there is always room for improvement.

[00:29:39.260] - Eden
So, what I want you to do is just keep in mind that marketing is based on the data and based on the data. You get to make changes, you get to make informed decisions. You can keep testing. And some of the things that you can do to make those changes are changing the graphics, tweak the copy on the sales page, play around with slightly different pricing. Maybe the $12 you tried didn't work, so you want to try 9. That's totally fine. Try that out for a little while. Maybe the graphics were not great, weren't solid, and you need to switch those up. Maybe the value incentive for the product doesn't appropriately communicate what the value actually is and what the transformation actually is. Okay. So, marketing is all about testing, analyzing, modifying and repeating that process over and over and over again. That might sound overwhelming, but don't let it be overwhelming. This is just part of the process for selling online. And it's fun. You just have to view it as a part of the journey. Often the biggest problem is the marketing message. I've talked to a lot of people. I've had thousands of students work with me on developing their own Tripwire product. And in my experience, when I evaluate whether or not someone's Tripwire is working, to the extent that it should be working or or evaluating why it's not working, I find that their messaging is wrong. Okay, so you have to- we're going back to what we said in the very beginning. You absolutely have to make sure your product solves a problem. Every product out there that you buy solves some kind of problem.

[00:31:18.340] - Eden
Take a look around at the things around you. Like all of these things that you have surrounding you are products that you will purchase at one point or another. I'm looking right now at my microphone. I purchased this microphone because in my very first online course that I sold, people told me that my audio absolutely sucked. They liked my content, but they thought my audio was terrible. And so what did I do? I went and bought a microphone to solve my audio problem because I wanted to be able to communicate my message clearly and effectively. And I wanted my students to have a really great experience learning from me. So, I bought a microphone to solve that problem. If you have a product that you're selling doesn't solve a problem that actually needs solving or just doesn't solve a problem at all, no one's going to buy it. So, if you don't focus on that, you're going to have a really hard time selling this product no matter what.

[00:32:09.340] - Eden
You also want to make sure that you don't focus too much on the feature. So, let's say your product really does solve a great problem. You might just be focusing on the wrong thing. You might be focusing on the features of each module in your mini course, or the chapters in your eBook. People don't really care about that. They want to know what your product is going to do for them. So focus on the transformation that your product is going to provide.

[00:32:32.650] - Eden
So, for an example, if your customer is worried that her cleaning products aren't safe for her baby at home and you're selling a product that's all about all-natural cleaning product recipes, your sales mechanism here, the thing you want to really focus on and drill down on is the fact that this is a baby safe product that's going to help you make natural cleaning products, that will help you as a parent, feel guilt free. Don't stress about your baby inhaling toxic cleaning products, because you're going to know exactly what's in your products and you're going to know that it's safe for your baby to crawl around. And even if they do, ingest a little bit of it, it's totally safe. You don't have to have that mom guilt. You can just rest easy. And that's huge. You want to focus on that? Okay.

[00:33:17.590] - Eden
All right. So let's review a little bit here. We talked about a lot. But again, the big idea here is that you want to make sure that in your funnel you are offering this tripwire at the right time. So, again, your goal is to drive qualified traffic over to your site. Once they're on your site, get them on your email list with the lead magnet and bam, right there at that dollar sign. And that's where you're going to be offering your tripwire offer to people. And usually this is instead of like a thank you page or whatever. So, right after they sign up for your lead magnet, they're going to see your tripwire sales page. Whether or not they buy it, they're still on your email list. And you have that opportunity to build a relationship with them, and nurture them with all kinds of quality content. And then eventually pitch and launch them a higher priced offer down the line. That's how it works.

[00:34:06.370] - Eden

[00:00:13.790] - Gergely Varga, Speaker
Hi everyone and welcome to the 2022 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. My name is Gergely Varga. Today I will talk about the power of stats and how to use your stats to win contracts and make more money.

[00:00:27.450] - Gergely
For those of you who don't know me. I am the founder of Authentic. Authentic is a smart reporting tool made for bloggers. It is now used by thousands of bloggers worldwide and we are growing fast.

[00:00:39.990] - Gergely
I have also been working in the influencer industry for the past six years, and with my wife, we have two successful blogs, You Could Travel and Yuzu Bakes. You Could Travel is a travel blog and our main business. In normal circumstances, the blog reaches over 5 million people a year. Yuzu Bakes is a vegan blog focused on sustainability. It is a young business, that's getting close to 1.2 million people a year.

[00:01:09.690] - Gergely
So Power of Stats, what does that even mean? Well, you need to produce creatives that resonate with your audience and take stats and data into account, but without compromising on your creativity. As a result, your creatives will be seen by an engaged audience that connects with you and converts into loyal customers. This means you now have the stats to show your value to brands.

[00:01:38.190] - Gergely
Here is the overview of today's talk. Build an engaged audience. Create the right content for your audience. I will talk about the importance of an engaged audience, why it is important to know your stats and how to use your stats to get paid more. I will explain what Authentic is and how to use it to make more money with it. I will also have a quick demo of Authentic and then lastly, I will talk about how to pitch new clients and win more contracts. At the end, there will, of course, be some time for questions via the chat.

[00:02:16.210] - Gergely
Most of you already worked with brands or businesses before, some of you got paid and others might just do this on a busy basis. As my wife and I are travel bloggers, our top priority when making money is to travel to new and exciting destinations. We couldn't always pick and choose the type of clients we wanted to work with or the destinations we wanted to visit. It's been a long journey to get where we are today and I will try and share some of the things we have learned along the way.

[00:02:45.270] - Gergely
One of the most important things that contributed to our success was building an engaged audience. We all know building a large and engaged audience is difficult. There are so many different channels fighting for our attention, and it is not easy to stand out. Still, the best advice is to be yourself. Our advice is to find a niche that fits you and fits your personality.

[00:03:09.550] - Gergely
Here are a couple of questions you can ask yourself: What is your business about?What is your value proposition? And why are you different than everybody else?

[00:03:21.010] - Gergely
Answering these questions, we discovered that when you write a blog, the most important asset you have is yourself. Being yourself is the easiest because it allows you to be the most authentic self even in the context of your business. People who are interested in you and your story will stick around. You can safely ignore the haters and the naysayers. They are not your audience. Although it's worth mentioning, they also contribute to your ad revenue.

[00:03:51.890] - Gergely
When posting new content. It's important that you are passionate about the topic. We call this authentic content because it's the easiest type of content to produce. It'll just come naturally to you because it's based on your interest and your experiences, and your audience will know that you are invested in what you post about and will happily join in the conversation.

[00:04:13.550] - Gergely
The same happens when you post sponsored content. When you pick the brands and sponsorships, make sure they are relevant to you and your audience. This is especially important because this way your post will generate a clear and real engagement. And I'm telling you all this because brands look for impressions and engagement as indicators of a successful post. Simply put, an engaged audience is going to make you more money. They will return to see your recommendations and purchase the products you sell. They are the ones who open your newsletters. Click ""like"" when you post something new on social media.

[00:04:53.030] - Gergely
So why is this important? Why am I telling you this? Brands usually like to look for influences that offer a somewhat guaranteed based outcome, meaning they have a good idea of what the ROI for their campaign is going to be and what outcome they should expect.

[00:05:10.250] - Gergely
By having an engaged audience, you almost always have a predictable model on how post is going to perform. Use your stats to showcase this information in a readable format that is easily digestible by the marketing team. Brands love an engaged audience. You will have a much easier time convincing brands to work with you. When you can show that your audience is engaged and active, better stats mean that you will convince more brands to work with you.

[00:05:40.370] - Gergely
So now that you have content and an engaged audience, it's time to see some numbers. If you have a blog, you probably have Google Analytics installed. Your social media accounts, of course, all come with usefull stats. Why is it important to check these stats?

[00:05:55.490] - Gergely
For two main reasons. One, use the data to make better creative decisions. For example, you can use your stats to check if your audience likes the newest trends on Instagram, and the other reason is based on the data. You can determine where is the best place for your creative content. For example, we all know that spontaneous server posts usually perform better on TikTok than on Instagram. Check your numbers and make decisions based on that. Hard numbers are the only thing that measures the success of your creativity, the better these numbers are, the better your chances of working with your dream brands.

[00:06:38.070] - Gergely
So when you work with brands, they will want to see a return on their investment. To create an ROI report, you will need to show your stats to determine the success of the campaign. Usually, brands will ask you to send them screenshots of your posts and stats. This is obviously very time-consuming and tedious to do. It is also difficult to provide these stats for content that has to mature first, like blog posts or YouTube videos.

[00:07:06.570] - Gergely
We had the same issues. And the more we worked with brands on campaigns, the more time we spent putting together long PDF documents with screenshots to show our results. Because of all this, we decided to create Authentic to automate and make this process simple.

[00:07:24.210] - Gergely
Authentic is an online tool that you can use to quickly collect your stats for each social media post and add them to a beautiful and easy-to-digest report. The generated professional reports are clean, easy-to-understand, and ready to be sent directly to your clients. They can be customized with your logo to fit your brand. And the best part, all the stats update automatically within the reports so your data never goes stale. You don't have to remember to update the stats on those blog posts you created three months ago. The stats are ready to be sent to your clients.

[00:08:03.290] - Gergely
I will now have a quick demo of Authentic. Authentic is a smart reporting tool made for influencers. You can use it to create ROI reports in minutes and share these reports with your clients. You can sign up to Authentic for free at any time. The free account is great for most influencers and it allows you to connect all your social media accounts and blog.

[00:08:26.130] - Gergely
The premium plan is for more established influencers who have multiple blogs or influencer businesses. It allows you to create multiple profiles and share unlimited case studies with your clients.

[00:08:41.850] - Gergely
After you log into Authentic, the first thing you see is your dashboard. I am now logged into Yuzu Bake's Demo account. This account doesn't use real numbers but works exactly like a normal account. On this page we list the social media accounts you can connect to and their current status.

[00:09:00.590] - Gergely
You can connect to your social networks directly from Authentic. Pinterest and TikTok do not currently support this option, but you can download our Authentic browser extension for Chrome to connect your account.

[00:09:15.790] - Gergely
Below the list, you can see some stats about each of your accounts. These stats are live and pull direct from the social network when available. This is meant to give you an overview of your stats and usually display insights for the last 30 days.

[00:09:31.390] - Gergely
Now I'm going to connect an Instagram account to Authentic to show you how quick and easy it is. A quick note you will need both an Instagram business or creator account and a Facebook business page for the connection to work.

[00:09:47.090] - Gergely
Facebook will ask you a couple of questions to confirm you are okay to connect your account. The last step is to select the account you want to connect. This step is important if you have multiple Instagram accounts connected to your Facebook. And it's done.

[00:10:04.150] - Gergely
While Authentic downloads the first ten stories, I will show you how profile looks like. This is your public profile on the top. You can customize it with your own picture or logo and write detailed description about you and your business. On the side, we display your latest stats and insights. These are public and can be viewed by your clients, when you share your profile with them. And in the middle, you can publish your past reports as case studies to show your clients what they can expect if they want to work with you.

[00:10:44.330] - Gergely
Now that the post have downloaded from the Instagram account, let's head to the media wall. The media wall gives you an overview of all your social media posts and blog articles you have in Authentic. It provides an easy to use interface to filter and search all your posts.

[00:11:04.310] - Gergely
On the top you can add some posts manually. For example, all Instagram stories can be added if you have a screenshot and the stats handy. This is useful because while we automatically download your Instagram stories every day, Authentic can only access stories that are not older than 24 hours. Pinterest pins and TikTok videos can be added to Authentic using our Authentic browser extension for Chrome. It's a quick and easy way to pick the pins and videos you need. Authentic will take care of the heavy lifting for you.

[00:11:38.750] - Gergely
Now that we have seen the dashboard, the profile, and the media wall, let's create a new report.

[00:11:46.710] - Gergely
The Reports page shows you a quick overview of all your reports and the campaigns you have been invited to. Reports are a great way to show the social media posts and articles you have created for specific clients or campaigns alongside your stats and engagement. Let's create a report to show off all the posts which we have about breads. I will call this report Best Breads.

[00:12:14.350] - Gergely
When you create a new report, you can customize a few things, like the report background and the campaign date. If you are creating this report from specific campaigns. Let's have an image of a nice herb bread as a background image.

[00:12:47.090] - Gergely
The description section allows you to explain more about the report, like explain who is the report was created for, what was the campaign about, and share details about the target audience, just to name a few.

[00:13:00.590] - Gergely
And finally, the part where you can select and add your social media post to the report. Click the big green button at the top of the page to open your media wall. I'm going to search for posts that contain the word ""bread"" and click on a few posts to select them.

[00:13:26.550] - Gergely
Once I have all the posts I wanted to add. I click Save and close, to close the media wall. Now you can see all the selected posts are listed on my report. The only thing left to do is save the report and check the results. At the top of the report. You can see the image we selected earlier and some information about you.

[00:13:47.790] - Gergely
There is also the report description with the details I explained earlier. The block in between gives you the URL you can use to share the report with your clients. Reports are private by default and can only be accessed using this unique link.

[00:14:04.770] - Gergely
And now let's look at the stats. Based on the posts you have selected. Authentic generates your stats and insights and displays them in a simple and easy to understand way.

[00:14:15.020] - Gergely
On the top, you can see a summary of all your stats, total impression and engagement of all the selected posts. Below a breakdown of stats by each social media. Here we display the total impressions and the engagement rate when available. Further down, you can find a more detailed breakdown of stats specific for each social media and then each post. For example, Google Analytics can give you insights into sessions and users for each post, so we display those numbers. While Facebook has clicks, comments, and shares.

[00:14:53.710] - Gergely
All these stats combined make up your report and most importantly, the stats are always up to date. Once the posts added to the report, we keep them updated for you so your reports don't go stale and your clients can access the most up to date information at any time. This is especially important for blog posts and YouTube videos, which usually take time to mature.

[00:15:16.330] - Gergely
For example, blog posts usually take two to three months to start showing useful stats. If you use Authentic, you don't have to remember to collect these stats yourself. This report will be automatically updated for you.

[00:15:29.770] - Gergely
You can see how powerful the reports can be, but how can you use them to make money? If you haven't worked with clients before, you can create reports based on a specific topic that fits the type of clients you would like to work with. When you pitch clients, send them the reports as part of your pitch to show the sort of engagement they can expect if they work with you. If you have already worked with clients before, you can use these reports as case studies to show new clients what you have achieved in the past. It's a great way to make it easy for guns to say yes to you.

[00:16:05.530] - Gergely
And finally, you can always create reports for yourself to track the improvement of your social media accounts and blog every month. Having these reports and seeing the increase in traffic or engagement can be a great motivation. I will now continue with the presentation.

[00:16:25.190] - Gergely
Now imagine how professional you will look when you send over these reports to your clients after a campaign showing off your amazing results and your engaged audience. Since we have been using Authentic, we've got incredible feedback, amazing testimonials, got offered more work and got recommended to other brands.

[00:16:45.230] - Gergely
If there is one thing we learned while running this business is that it's our job to make it easier for brands to say yes. Here is how. Provide them with a proposal that saves some research, show a return on their investment to save them money, and give them an auto updating report that saves them time.

[00:17:06.230] - Gergely
How to win new clients with this approach.

[00:17:10.310] 
As we started using Authentic for past campaigns, we quickly realized that the reports can be used as case studies to pitch new clients.

[00:17:19.890] - Gergely
It worked like a charm. Since we started sending out previous reports showcasing our results alongside our media kits. We went from pitching brands and hearing nothing back to getting answers within 24 hours, saying that they are interested in working with us.

[00:17:37.790] - Gergely
As a result, we could charge more for our content and pick the clients and campaigns we were interested in. It is now obvious to us that businesses like to see authentic results before they spend their money, so make it easier for them to say yes and brands will love you.

[00:17:56.450] - Gergely
The keys to building a successful influencer business are a loyal engaged audience, authentic content, and authentic stats. You can sign up to Authentic for free. The free account is perfect for most bloggers and it is always going to be free. The pro version is for established bloggers who have multiple blogs or influencer businesses. With the code at the end of this talk, Pro Pass holders get access to our Pro plan for free for one year. Thank you for your attention and I'm open for any questions.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Okay. Thank you so much for joining us for the session with Jenn Zellers from Virtual Summit Search. Welcome, Jenn. I appreciate you doing this.

Jenn Zellers [00:00:08]:
Hi. I'm excited to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:10]:
Yes. And we're you're gonna be digging into Google Analytics and how can I help you grow your blog, because I feel like when people start a blog, they're like, told, okay, install Google Analytics, and then it, like, stops there. But Google Analytics is so powerful. You can do so much with it. So, yeah, I'm really excited. You know, anything you wanna sort of add before you dive into things?

Jenn Zellers [00:00:33]:
Yeah. So just a quick overview of what I'm planning to cover today. I want to talk about how do you use Google analytics to increase your traffic to what we all want to do, make more money, and monetize your blog. even get more content and blog post ideas. And the 2 of my favorites are figuring out how to better leverage your social media and track your goal your website. So that's what we're gonna be talking about today.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:57]:
Yes. Well, I, I have to admit. I have our own set goals. Like, it I'm like, oh, I need to. I really should I know I can. So I'm excited to learn something from your session as well. So I actually can can get mine set up the way it should be. So Alright.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:12]:
Let's go ahead and dive in. I'm super pumped. Here we go.

Jenn Zellers [00:01:16]:
Okay. So this is the first screen that you're going to see when you log into Google Analytics most of the time. It's just Google's kinda quick home page overview of what's going on on your website. So as you can see, there are active users, and that just shows who's actually on your website right now and what page do you mean? A quick overview of the last 7 days of your traffic, things like that. we're not gonna go into this too much because we're going to go into other things. So the first thing you're gonna wanna do is if you well, if you haven't set up Google Analytics already, you're gonna wanna do that. but this is assuming you have set up Google Analytics. If you haven't, just come back to this after you have, set it up.

Jenn Zellers [00:02:01]:
And first thing we're going to do is set up some goals because this is going to be important for all the other things that we are going to talk So you'll go over here to the left hand menu and click admin. And I'm using a client's Google Analytics to demo this. So we are going to go over to their goals. And as you can see, there's already a couple of, goals set up So I am going to show you how to set those up for yourself now. So you go into here, click new goal. And the first one we're gonna wanna do is pages per session. So you'll click custom. Continue evening with whatever you want.

Jenn Zellers [00:02:38]:
That'd be pages per session. you'll click the pages presentation down there. That's all pretty self explanatory so far. and then here, you'll want to set it to greater than 1. So what that'll do is make it so that anyone who views at least two pages on your website, whether it's a blog post or about page, whatever it happens to be, it will show up as a success, a conversion on this goal. So then you want to verify this goal. And what this does is it checks your traffic from the last 7 days and sees if it will would have, converted on the goal. So in this case, it shows that Centella Studio, which is this, the site that I'm using for this would have had almost 10 a half percent conversions.

Jenn Zellers [00:03:24]:
So that means 10 a percent of the people who visited the site, visited at least two pages during their visit. You also see this value, thing we're going to ignore that for right now just because pages per session is not a super great metric of if people are going to convert to paying customers. So we're going to leave that for right now. You would then click save. In this case, I'm not going to just because I already have this goal set up. So I don't actually want to set it up. But once you hit save, or in my case, cancel. You'll see that that goal is now in your goals list.

Jenn Zellers [00:04:04]:
I'm also gonna show you how to set up the email opt ins. before I do that, I just wanna tell you a quick thing about the goals per session. The reason that that's important is because it measure. It's it kinda gives you a good metric for how engaged people are on your site. If they're clicking to multiple pages, it means that they like what they've seen. and maybe they're clicking off of a blog post onto your About me page or whatever it is. And they're just trying to learn more about you and what you're you're doing on your blog. So that's a great first metric to see how much, engagement you're getting on your site.

Jenn Zellers [00:04:41]:
The email opt ins, of course, is important because as a blogger, you're trying to grow your email list. Like, that is one of the things you're over and over and over again. So You wanna make sure that your email's, list is converting from your blog post and your other pages. So to set this up, we're going to go to new goal again. and I'm going to go to custom once again. And you can leave it whenever you want me to email list You'll go to destination and continue. And then this is where you may have to do a little bit of back end setup if you don't already have a thank you page. So In this case, what you want the thank you patient to do is once they have given you their name and email address, most email marketing providers will let you set up a redirect so that, once they send you that, it'll automatically redirect them to a page in this case, the thank you page.

Jenn Zellers [00:05:33]:
and you might just say, hey, thanks for joining. So I'm so excited to have you. here's a good place to start and get them, like, to take some blog posts that most people are interested in whatever it happens to be, maybe ask them to share. But whatever it is, you wanna have that thank you page set up. So that you'll go ahead and grab the URL for that thank you page and put it in here. You only want the part of the URL that is after your domain name. So in this case, cintilla.studio/thank-you is their thank you page, but you don't want to put the actual domain name. That's where it's gonna think dash u.

Jenn Zellers [00:06:12]:
And, it'll remind you down here not to put the domain name in because Google will automatically add that for you. This is somewhere where you may want to use the value option. so say you have, you know, a certain amount of your subscribers, maybe 20% will, pay you for your $5 trip wire product or whatever it happens to be. So an email subscriber would be worth a dollar because that's 20 percent of the 5. So you could assign it a $1 value, and that just kinda helps you see which pages are giving you the most value and the most return on investment if, say, you're spending money on ads. We're gonna ignore the funnel for right now. then we're gonna verify it. In this case, we they don't have a lot of data set up on the thank you page right now.

Jenn Zellers [00:07:02]:
So theirs shows a 0%, but yours may show more than that. And that's fine. And if you haven't set up your thank you page, of course, you are gonna see 0% It doesn't necessarily mean that you set it up wrong, but if in, say, 7 to 30 days, depending on how much traffic you get, you're still not seeing conversions, you may want to come back and take a look and just make sure you did set it up right. So you would hit save. I'm gonna hit cancel because, again, I've already got it set up, and I know it'll show up right there. You can come in here for a quick overview of the conversions on these goals from the last 7 days. So in this case, we just set up the pages per session goal for them today.

Jenn Zellers [00:07:45]:
You've already had 7 conversions, so that's not bad. so, yeah, that's setting up your goals. Like I said, you can do a lot of things with goals, but we're not gonna get into them right now because I could go down a rabbit hole on that [inaudible]. So, okay. We're gonna go ahead and move on. So the next thing we're gonna look at is your traffic because everybody wants to get more traffic to your blog. That's how you get money. That's how you get your email subscribers.

Jenn Zellers [00:08:13]:
So we'll start right there. So the first report that you're gonna wanna look at inside of Google Analytics is your source slash medium. That may sound weird. I'll explain in just a minute to get there, though. You're going to go over to acquisition once you're back in your main Google analytics, which can get you by clicking home. So acquisition, all traffic, and then source slash medium. And in here, you will see all the different page or all the different places that you're getting traffic from. So in this case, you'll see that interest in Google are the top refer, are the top traffic sources for Centella Studio.

Jenn Zellers [00:08:49]:
And then you'll see this direct traffic. And all that means is that it's traffic that is something that Google can't track either they're typing in the URL manually, they're coming to it from a bookmark. Maybe they came to the blog post in the past and saved it for later on their browser bookmarks or it's just something that Google doesn't have enough information to tell you where it came from. So, unfortunately, it's not super helpful for figuring out where your traffic sources are, but those pages will still show up in other reports. So it is still useful in the long run. And what you'll wanna do here is just keep an eye out from which places are sending you the most traffic And that's typically where you wanna put the most effort and possibly money if that's something you're doing into. You will also see so that's what sources. sources like Pinterest, Google, Facebook, that sort of thing.

Jenn Zellers [00:09:43]:
And you will also see this like referral and organic and stuff like that. referral just means that it's a website that referred traffic to you. So Pinterest refers traffic via their pins, Facebook refers traffic via the link on Facebook posts, Instagram, camera, bio, all that kind of good stuff. that is something where you may see direct traffic. So if you have traffic from Instagram, and you're putting a link in the post itself that would end up showing up as direct traffic. But there are ways around that you have to use campaigns not gonna get into that right now. Just know that it is possible to track that and see where it does come from Instagram or places like that. You will also wanna keep an eye out for really weird looking websites.

Jenn Zellers [00:10:27]:
If you see something that you're like, what's the dot org or whatever, which I don't actually know. I've never seen that one. Don't necessarily go and go to that website. A lot of the time, that can be spam, and it's coming from automatic bots, and it can go to really bad sites that could have viruses If you really wanna know what it is, go to Google or another search engine and type in what is and then paste in that URL, and just make sure that it's legit before you actually go look at it because you don't want that things to happen to your computer or your website. so that's just a little caveat with the traffic sources just be careful. okay. So from there, we are going to move on to finding your best and worst performing pages and posts. So we're actually going to stay in this same report.

Jenn Zellers [00:11:21]:
We're going to click other though. and then click landing page. So you'll type in landing of however much of it, and then just click it. Excuse me. And then this is going to show you which actual pages are getting traffic. Sorry. So you can see he's got a blog post on songwriting, a blog posts on how to create a a computer wallpaper, some other posts down here, and those are getting the most traffic. So the top 3 right there are definitely his best performing posts there at least double what all the other ones are getting.

Jenn Zellers [00:11:57]:
So you in thoughts based on users anyway. So what users are is the unique, people. So, like, the unique IP addresses, which I know is technical, essentially as Google knows if someone is busy. And, again, that's really what it comes down to. So, that's just the individual people rather than the number of pages that they're viewing or the number of times they're coming, which is what sessions is. So session is when they do one or more pages within a certain time frame. and if they leave or if they're inactive, 30 minutes, then it counts as a new session, but Google knows, oh, they already visited. So they don't count as a new user.

Jenn Zellers [00:12:40]:
So that's why you'll see that There's a 1055 users, but there's 1149 sessions because some people came back again later. So when you're looking for your best performing pages, you can either show up by users or sessions. It automatically, like, by default, sorts by users. So we're just gonna continue with that. to find the worst performing pages, you would click users again. And in this case, most of the, like, late less performing pages only have one user, so we're not gonna go with that. with this case, but if you have pages that are getting my my guideline is usually about 10% of the best performing pages. So in this case, I would say if he's getting 15 to 20 or, thereabouts that they get minimum, that many pay users visiting those pages, those are really great ones to be able to optimize to increase the traffic.

Jenn Zellers [00:13:41]:
So in this case, he might go and take all of his 4 through 10, most trafficked blog posts and go ahead and work on that search engine optimization, go ahead and promote them more, just make them more valuable for people so they're more likely to stick around. and look at other pages. So you can actually see if they have looked at other pages with your goals over here. So in this case, you can actually see that the creative excuses blog post, someone went and went to more than one page when they were there. And the same thing for the finishing map tutorial that he has. He got more than one person to go to another page for that. So that's a great way to see which ones are actually doing well to you and not just having someone come, look at it and leave, which is called a bounce. And, oh, one other quick note, this little slash here, that just means it's your home page.

Jenn Zellers [00:14:38]:
so if you see that That's all that is. It doesn't mean it's broken or anything. so and if you click these, it'll open up the blog post in another tab. So okay. so that's the best and worst performing post and how to use them to increase traffic. The best performing post, you just wanna make the most out of them, increase the SEO even if you can. get one eyeballs on in as much as you can, which actually brings me to my next point, which is, I'll make more money using your Google Analytics data. So we're actually gonna stick right here because you want to optimize your best performing posts.

Jenn Zellers [00:15:19]:
The ones that are already getting a lot of eyeballs are going to be more likely to have enough people to convert them to paying customers. Typically, the best way to start with that when you're blogging is picking affiliate links, which you probably already know, but I'll just say it again. So find your best performing posts and find ways to add affiliate links to them in a way that doesn't feel salesy. So, for example, the, songwriting tutorial that he has, he could go and find some books on Amazon that relate to that. he could link them to some sheet music that they could buy, like blank sheet music or whatever. and things like that for the wallpaper, the wallpaper tutorial, maybe there are some software that you could recommend for people who use to make that, things like that. So if you get a little bit creative with the things that you can link to as affiliate links, and maybe you're doing like a lifestyle blog and it's really easy because you're showing your outfit you can just go link to where you bought that during affiliate links. But the more creative you can get, the better it'll be, and don't forget to include your disclaimer.

Jenn Zellers [00:16:28]:
because if you don't, that can get you into legal trouble. I know you probably already know that, but, again, just gotta say it. So that is a really great way to increase your blog income without having to do a ton of work. There are even some, some plugins that you can get. Like, there's a plugin by TC pins that will automatically add a link. You give a keyword and you give it the affiliate link or any a basic link, even and it will automatically go through and add that to every, every time that that keyword shows up. And Then you only have to go in and update that link once inside of the plugin, and it will update it again in your blog post. So that can be a really great way to easily optimize your affiliate income.

Jenn Zellers [00:17:15]:
another thing that you can do is find search queries. So we're going to move on to that. So you will go to, search console and inquiries. Over here in the acquisition tab, And then this will show you all of the search engine queries. So things that people type into Google or Bing or whatever search engine they're using. And, unfortunately, Google can only show you a certain number of them. A lot of people have blockers that they use on their browsers, but Even the amount of traffic or data that you can get from this can be might be useful in the long run. So One of the best ways to make more money with this is maybe you have a blog post that is not getting a ton of traffic but is getting a lot of search traffic.

Jenn Zellers [00:18:04]:
And search traffic can actually be one of the best traffic to get if you're trying to monetize your blog because People that are searching for things are looking for answers and results. And if you can provide those answers and results, they're much more likely to buy the things that you recommend to achieve that. So in this case, again, the minimalist art wallpaper, is something that was one of his top posts, but it's also getting a lot of search traffic. And so you can go in here and figure out which ones are getting the most search. And you can optimize those to get even better search engine results and add affiliate links to them even if they're not your top post, because if you can get people that are more likely to actually buy things, obviously, you're gonna make more money even if you're getting less traffic. And then another thing that I hear a lot is how do I find content ideas? Because when you're blogging, you're coming up with a lot of ideas, and you have to write a lot of content in order to keep your blog going. So where do you figure out what to do with that? And this can actually be a really great place to do that.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:14]:
So you'll note that this shows you how many clicks each, search query has gotten. So people have searched how to make minimalist art, and he's done 18 clicks out of that. but there are other ways to find data from search and inquiries. So we yeah. You're gonna go. And we're going to be in the search console still, and we're gonna go to landing pages this time. So what we're doing here is this will show you the actual pages that are showing up in search results. So you'll notice the multi classing and everything, which If you don't speak nerd, that's a Dungeons And Dragons reference.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:53]:
I'm I'm one of those nerds, so I say that with love but that is a blog post that gets tons of traffic, there are lots of nerds searching for multi classing, apparently. And it doesn't show you the queries. but it shows you that this has shown up in almost 14,000 searches, but it's only gotten 50 clicks over the last 30 days. which is really low. And you can tell that because this CTR, which stands for a click through rate, is only 0.36% versus this minimalist wallpaper, which is over 6%. So that's a great one to be able to optimize. to find more content, to get more traffic to it.

Jenn Zellers [00:20:34]:
so he could optimize that post itself to get traffic, but You can also take that and find contents that is related to that in order to get more traffic to that type of post. So if people are searching for multiclassing, he might be able to find other related terms. So if you go back to search queries. We can go ahead and sort by impressions. And impressions is, how many times it's showing up in a search query. So in this case, 5e multi classing has shown at 677 times. So that would relate back to that blog post. And if you can find something a different angle to take on 5th edition multi classing, for dungeons, and dragons, He could probably get a lot more traffic to that type of post because a lot of people are searching for it.

Jenn Zellers [00:21:25]:
And you'll notice that the 4th result is pretty much the same thing backwards. So we're doing a little bit of digging, a little bit of sleuthing to find the things that are getting a lot of traffic to searches but aren't resulting in traffic for you. Those can be really great ways to find you content ideas because Those are people that want the content you have, but they're not seeing it. And you can actually tell that they're not seeing it because coming back to here, you can see this average position column. So what that means is where it shows up in search results. So if you do a search on Google, you'll see that there are ten, I mean, there's ads and then there's, like, 10 results of actual results. And so there's about 10 results per page Your goal is to have an average position of 10 or less because that means you are reliably showing up in the top 10 search results and let's be real when most people don't go past the first page of Google results anymore because Google's gotten really good at showing me what you actually want to see. So in this case, this multi crossing and everything is showing up on the 3rd page of the search results typically, which means most people are not seeing it, which explains why he hasn't gotten a lot of clicks.

Jenn Zellers [00:22:42]:
And ironically, this minimal wallpaper is getting an average position of 31, which puts it on the 4th page of the search results. But what that actually tells you is that there's a percentage of the time where it is showing up in probably that first 10, position, like, 1 through 10. And then the rest of the time is probably showing up more like 50 or something like that, and so it averages out to that middle ground. but he's got a lot of clicks, a lot of sessions out of that. And so that is something that maybe there are other topics around that that he could fill and optimize for it as well. yeah, that that's one of my favorite ways to find content ideas is going to seem what people are searching for, what not actually finding you for, and optimizing around that. The other thing you can do is go and see which pages have been getting the most traffic over the last 3 months or so. So I'm gonna come back to here, and we've got the landing pages pulled up still.

Jenn Zellers [00:23:48]:
And we are going to Okay. So I'll go to 10th October. And, you can see that this blog post has gotten the most traffic. So what you can do there is go into the blog post and see if there's a piece of that that you could expand on more. So maybe there is one of these in this case of creative excuses that he could talk about more and find a slightly different keyword and just get more traffic out of that. It's in the min minimalist wallpaper. Again, clearly, this is a really good one. he could go in there and maybe see what other kinds of art tutorials you could find to do because people clearly like that and just kinda getting creative with the different things you can do.

Jenn Zellers [00:24:42]:
So it's really similar to the search queries, but just a little bit different because you're going off of what is actually getting traffic. because that way you can link back to it in new post that's getting traffic and hopefully increase your pages per session and things like that. Okay. And the other thing you wanna do is make sure your demographics are enabled. That's something that you would think people would automatically do, we do have to turn it on. I have a little lesson that in Google Analytics 101, so I'm not gonna go into it too much here. And but last but not least, one thing that I get lost a lot about is social media because Everybody's on social media. Everyone wants to know how to get more traffic out of social media.

Jenn Zellers [00:25:26]:
So let's move on to that. So to get to the social media report, you're going to go to acquisition, social, and then network referrals is usually the best reports you see for us. So this is where we're at. You can see that over the last 30 days, he's gotten traffic from Pinterest a little tiny bit from Facebook and one from reddit, so Pinterest is queen of the giants in social media world force into the studio. And, what that means is that you need to analyze that a bit more. So to analyze it a bit more, you just have to click on that particular social network. and it will open up another report. And this one is gonna show you the actual pages that have gotten from your different pinterest.

Jenn Zellers [00:26:09]:
So These 3 are getting pretty significant traffic from Pinterest. These ones not so much. Partly becaus nano arrival within November. but this will go ahead and show you how many sessions are getting page views. And then the most important one in my book is the session duration and pages per session. So the session duration is how long someone actually spends on your website. If it's less than a minute, most likely they're not reading your blog post, it should be at least 30 seconds to a minute to qualify as a solid visit in my book.

Jenn Zellers [00:26:46]:
This can vary depending on like, what kind of topics you're talking about, if it's something where they're just giving it to you, see if your kids are whatever it might be, maybe they are spending less time. But if you're doing tutorials or recipes or anything like that, most likely they're going to need to be on the page for longer than, you know, 6 seconds. And you also wanna see pages per session that are higher than 1 because you're hoping that people are going to more than one page off of this. So if you're doing recipes, make sure you're linking to your complimentary recipes that they may wanna try. If you have outfits, like, doing a lifestyle blog, bring back to other blog posts that related to that as well. Tutorials, there are always different tutorials that you can link back to So things like that to keep in mind your site longer is always good. And this is also something that is very important when it comes to social media because You may be getting a lot of traffic from it, but is it actually quality traffic? Because in this case, you can see the pages per session, which is one of the goals we set up, but you cannot see the email conversions. So I'm going to go and show you real quick how to do that.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:01]:
So we're going to come back to this source slash medium report. And I left down the landing pages because that's what we really care about. Actually, no. Sorry. I was wrong. I'm gonna go to source slash medium after all. Okay. So once we're back to here, what you can do is say we wanna analyze the Pinterest traffic more.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:20]:
You're gonna click this little enhanced link here. And you'll notice it. Hang on. Okay. So you want to set it to include and leave it with source slash medium containing. And in this case, since we want to include all Pinterest traffic regardless of how it shows up in Google, because in just a second, see that it shows up differently depending on where it's coming from, see this type of Pinterest and click apply. There's a lot of different options, but you don't need them right now. So hit apply and you'll notice that now it, knocks out everything from Google and Bing and Facebook and everything else.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:58]:
We just have Pinterest So this is where making sure it's just pinterest, not, pinterest.com is important because you've got the regular pinterest.com, which is typically in the US, Then you've got, like, Canada and the UK and maybe this is Zambia. I'm not sure. we've got, like, France down here and things like that. So making sure that you are including everything that's relevant can be really important. So now you can come over here to the conversion section and see if there are conversions. We're gonna go to the pages per session because I know we don't have any emails right now. And as you can see, this one, which leaves Spain or Estonia. I don't know.

Jenn Zellers [00:29:41]:
All the different Pinterest sites are really confusing, but that particular version of Pinterest is giving 25% conversions to people who are saying for at least two pages. Whereas from the US, we're getting 0.24%, which is really sad. and again, this is also pretty a pretty new goal, so it doesn't have all the information from the previous week necessarily, which is why this other one is actually really helpful because then even if you don't have your, your goal set up quite yet, you can still see if it's getting good pages per session. But if you want to see the email opt in rate, you can go into here And, again, this one doesn't have any yet, but if you have your setup and you've had your thank you page set up, then you would be able to see Is Pinterest actually giving the email convergence? Because, you know, maybe you don't actually care if there is any more than one page on Pinterest because typically, Pinterest is a high bounce rate, which means a lot of people come from Pinterest. Look at the blog. They'll say, okay. That sounds good. We've almost immediately and then go save it on Pinterest.

Jenn Zellers [00:30:49]:
Do you you later, which lets me really probably won't. So you wanna find ways, especially with interest, to make sure that you're getting more value out of the visits. So you could go and get your email options like, hey. Don't save this for later. Let me help you implement this now and things like that. So checking to make sure that you are converting for some type of goal is really helpful because maybe you're putting a ton of time in the Pinterest. Maybe you're on there the 2 hours a day And then once you have your goal set up and you've got some data flow and then you're realizing, it's not actually doing anything for you. It's not making you money.

Jenn Zellers [00:31:27]:
It's not getting you email subscribers. and maybe go down to, like, 15, 30 minutes a day because if it's not making you any return on that investment of time, It may not be worth it. So and maybe you're getting more traffice from Instagram or at least it's higher quality traffic. So that's just a little caveat, a little bit of a soapbox just because you're getting a lot of traffic from a particular traffic source, whether it's Pinterest or Google or whatever, it doesn't mean that it's quality traffic. It doesn't mean it's traffic that's going to get you any money or email subscribers or whatever other goals you have for your blog. So be really careful about investing time into traffic sources that do not actually get you anything in return. So this is why I had to set up your goals first because if you have those goals, it's a lot easier to tell if you're getting that return on investment. when you're putting your time into something.

Jenn Zellers [00:32:24]:
So that's pretty much my my best tips for blogging. I mean, I have a lot more but that's all we have time for right now. So if you have any questions, I'm always happy to answer them. And if you want the Google Analytics 101, go ahead and grab that too.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:41]:
Wow. That was super awesome, Jenn. Thank you so much for sharing all that super helpful information. I can't wait to dive into my Google Analytics. any final words for people watching the summit?

Jenn Zellers [00:32:52]:
I guess just that if you haven't sat figured out how to install your Google analytics, or if you haven't done some of the little things that a lot of people miss like setting up your demographics and your search console because those are not automatically in your Google Analytics account. I've got a quick freebie that you can download, so make sure to press that too.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:12]:
Yes. So grab that and then your, your Google Analytics 101 as well to help people dive even further. So thank you so much. I appreciate it. All the information guys is below the video, and we are excited for you to to get your feedback and to hear what how you're using what you learned in this session. So Awesome. Thank you so much.

[00:00:09.750] - Jenn Zellers, virtualsummitsearch.com
OK, so let's talk about five things that Google Analytics can tell you about your blog or Website and what to actually do with the information that you get from that.

[00:00:17.970] - Jenn
So we're going to be asking five questions and we're going to ask 1. Where's the traffic? 2. What are they searching for when they find your Website? 3. Who's actually coming to your Website? 4. Where are they going on your Web site? And, 5. then what are they doing when they get to your website? So I'm going to start off by sharing my screen real quick. We'll go over here. And so this is going to be the first thing that you see when you come into Google Analytics.

[00:00:44.250] - Jenn
This is their default dashboard. So I'm using the Google Analytics demo account. It essentially pulls data from their merch store. So it gives us a lot more information than a typical smaller website. So it just kind of helps for visualization, I can talk today....

[00:01:02.190] - Jenn
So as you can see on here, you get some idea of how many people are coming each day, what their conversion rate is, that type of thing. You can see how many people are currently on their website. So it's about fifty five ish. How many people are coming back month over month where they're coming from around the world, things like that. But we're not going to dive into this too much because this isn't the stuff that we want to talk about.

[00:01:26.580] - Jenn
So the first thing that we're going to ask is where is the traffic? So where are they actually coming from?

[00:01:35.040] - Jenn
So to get here, you're going to go to Aquisition> all traffic and then source slash Medium. All that really means is what website are they coming from? And that's the source. And then the Medium is what type of traffic as it's like, is it paid? Is it organic or essentially organic just means that it's not paid for and stuff like that. So in this case, you can see that Google's main traffic is coming from direct/none.

[00:02:01.840] - Jenn
So what that means is there is, the source is direct. So typically that means that someone is typing in the URL directly into the browser or they're coming from bookmark or there's some other reason that they can't track where it's actually coming from. And then the none just means that because of that, they don't know what the type of traffic is. So it's not paid, it's not organic, it just is. And then the next highest one is their Google-CPC, which stands for cost per click.

[00:02:30.990] - Jenn
So what that means is that their second highest traffic source is their paid ads.

[00:02:35.370] - Jenn
So I mean, its Google, they're paying themselves, but they have paid ads, essentially their campaigns that people are clicking when they're typing in a search query. And so that's where their second highest traffic is.

[00:02:51.360] - Jenn
When it says not set. Unfortunately, what that means is that Google can't get any information on it. Either someone's using a tracker blocker or they, for whatever reason, are not allowed to track their, like where they're coming from. So that one is kind of just stuck.

[00:03:08.250] - Jenn
You can't get any more information off of that, but if you're looking at, say, this PartnerSource affiliates, what that typically means is that they gave someone a specific URL to send out as an affiliate, and so they want to see how their affiliates are performing. So there are affiliates are number four on their traffic, which isn't too bad. And then as we go down, you'll see this one's another paid AD the DfacPM. The Google slash organic is organic search traffic.

[00:03:35.570] - Jenn
So that means that someone typed something into the search bar and they clicked on a nonpaid search results. And you just kind of go down here. The referral just, it doesn't mean a whole lot. It just means that the traffic was referred from somewhere. So in this case, the mail.Google is a Gmail link, like someone opened up an email and clicked on it. It's not a whole lot.

[00:03:58.150] - Jenn
But what you can do with this information is take it and figure out where you're getting the traffic from. So say you were running some paid search ads for your blog or your website knowing that the cost per click ads are getting you the most traffic is really helpful. It means you can put more money into it if you want, or figure out other ways to get more search traffic without paying for it, which is always nice. And if you're trying to track if you have affiliates like you have your own courses or products that you list on your website, knowing if your affiliates are sending you traffic is also helpful.

[00:04:34.390] - Jenn
So kind of just go in and here's where your best traffic, your most traffic is coming from and then optimizing. That is a really good way to use this metric. The next thing we're going to look at is what are they searching for? So to get here, we're going to go to aquisition again. But this time we're going to go to search console and then queries.

[00:04:54.340] - Jenn
So as you can see in here, we have a bunch of different queries.

[00:04:58.750] - Jenn
So this is a query, just the terms that someone is searching when they are finding your website. So in this case, their highest one, someone typed in DynoGame into Google, and when they typed in Dyno Game, one of their products came up. So you can see in here we've got clicks. Impressions, CTR and average position. So what that means is the clicks pretty probably pretty obvious. It's how many times people have actually clicked on the link from the search query in order to get to the website.

[00:05:32.170] - Jenn
The impressions is how many times people have seen that search query in the results, whether or not they've clicked on it. The click through rate is a combination of those. So they take impressions, divide it by the click. Well, sorry, backwards. They take the clicks, divide it by the impressions, and that's the percentage of people that have clicked through otherwise the click through rate. So 3.47% of people who search for Dynogame have actually clicked and gone through to Google's product page.

[00:05:59.170] - Jenn
And then the average position is where on those search results it actually ranks. So there's usually 10 results in the first page of the search results when you search for something. So your goal is to be less than 10, because if you're more than 10, let's be real. Most people don't go to the second page of the search results anymore. So in this case, you can see they came up around about four fourth in the listings. So that helps with their click through rate because you can see the next one is at number eight and it only gets less than half a percent of people who click through to get to that page.

[00:06:37.990] - Jenn
So the higher you are in the position, the better your click through rate typically tends to be. So comparing Dynogame versus dinosaur game, Dyno game definitely gets the much better results than dinosaur games, but they could do it. That is, take that information and optimize their SEO so they could go and use Dyno game instead of Dinosaur game. They could sprinkle that in in more optimal places. There's a lot of things you can do with that.

[00:07:07.450] - Jenn
So if there's a particular search term that you are trying to rank for, that you want people when they search for something, they want that you want you to be the first person that shows up. Go ahead and get into this data and see where you're ranking right now and figure out how you can improve that.

[00:07:25.150] - Jenn
So next thing that we're going to look at is who is actually coming to your website. So to get here, we're going to go to audience again. And this time we're going to go to demographics and overview.

[00:07:35.980] - Jenn
So this is a pretty simple overview. So you can see the ages that are coming to the Google website. So they have the most users in the 25 to 34 year old range and then they've got 18 to 24, 18 to 24 year olds and it kind of drops off after that. They also have primarily men that are coming to their website. So that's interesting. Some people have more men than women. Some are pretty evenly split. This one's not too far off at 59.1% and 40.1%.

[00:08:08.500] - Jenn
But knowing that can help you with targeting, as well. Men and women, tend to have different things they're looking for. So if you're trying to attract more men or more women, this can help you figure out how to do that. Another thing in the demographics that you can do is go to the interests.

[00:08:26.350] - Jenn
So we're just going to look at the overview real quick. And this is, it can look a little weird.

[00:08:34.750] - Jenn
So there's a lot of things going on here you got the affinity category, which makes no sense, the in market segment, which also doesn't really help, and the other category. So completely ignoring the titles of these things because they're just jargon. What you're looking at is the different things that your visitors have also expressed interest in. So in this case, Google has a lot of people who are value shoppers. They're looking for a good deal at a good price. They also love movies.

[00:09:05.380] - Jenn
They like technology. So maybe they're the first ones you get a new cell phone or the new PS5 or whatever it happens to be. They like music.

[00:09:15.610] - Jenn
And so knowing all of these things can help you also with targeting and SEO and all sorts of other stuff. So if you maybe have a Facebook page for your community, you could use questions around this like what's the best deal you've gotten this week or what's your favorite movie, whats the next song I should listen to? Stuff like that. You can go in here and get ideas off of that. The market segment is more about advertising. So these are things that they might be looking for, advertising and marketing services that they want to buy, those kind of services.

[00:09:48.610] - Jenn
They're looking for women's apparel. So maybe you start making T-shirts or something like that. They're looking for employment. I probably aren't going to integrate that as much, but stuff like that can be really helpful. So if you're looking at it with a creative lens, you can go and figure out ways that you can serve the needs of your audience based on this. And keep in mind, with these types of things, it is very broad.

[00:10:12.670] - Jenn
They do not have very specific information on this type of thing, but it can be a good just kind of umbrella to give you an idea of what you could do to give your audience more value.

[00:10:27.220] - Jenn
So the next thing we're going to look at is where are they going? So to get here, we're going to go back to acquisition all traffic and source-Medium. This time, instead of actually looking at the source in the Medium, we're going to go to landing page. So to do that, you'll click over here, start typing in landing page and then you'll just click that. And what this is going to do is switch it over from telling you where they're coming from to where they're going.

[00:10:53.350] - Jenn
And this is helpful because it can help you find your best pages and even your worst pages in terms of performance so that you can go ahead and optimize them to get even more traffic to them. So in this case, we can see that Google's top page that people are going to on their store is the home page. It makes sense if they're searching for something, then it's entirely likely that's the first thing that's going to come up. And then from there, they'll start searching for actual products.

[00:11:20.800] - Jenn
But the next highest one is this YouTube one. So they may be searching for products that are related to YouTube. The next one is, unsurprisingly, based on the search queries, the dyno game.

[00:11:34.870] - Jenn
So knowing this type of thing, you can go in there and start optimizing the page. You can look at the search queries, you can look at their interests and things like that in order to make your page show up more often and you can optimize your ad traffic, send more people there and whatever else you want to do with it. So knowing your best pages can be one of the top ways to get more people to those pages. But if you want to find the one, you're pages that are doing the worst, so maybe you're doing click, like the CPC, cost per click ads and you're sending them to a page that isn't getting the kind of traffic you want, you can go ahead in here.

[00:12:18.370] - Jenn
You just go and you click the users and that will flip it. So that is showing the ones that get the least amount of traffic. So you can see, is a page that I'm paying for not performing the way I want or as a page that I'm trying to get the SEO working again on, not doing the way it should. So going in here can really help you figure out if you need to stop pouring time and energy and maybe even money into a particular page, or if you want to go ahead and optimize something that is already working really well for you.

[00:12:49.750] - Jenn
So the last thing that we're going to look at is what are they doing once they get to your website? So this is one of my favorite reports.

[00:12:58.750] - Jenn
It looks like spaghetti, but I can give you some really great data.

[00:13:03.250] - Jenn
So we're going to go back to audience for this one. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of that section and click users flow, so.

[00:13:11.010] - Jenn
The country one is what it automatically defaults to, thats not super helpful for us as a blogger or someone with a website. So what we're going to go in here is we're going to search for source. And we're not going to do source/medium because that breaks it down a bit more granularly than you necessarily need to, unless you're doing something like paid ads where you want to see, OK, are people coming? Like what are they doing when they come from paid search result versus an organic search result?

[00:13:44.130] - Jenn
That might be helpful, but typically I would recommend just going with this because they know they get all of the Google results, they'll get all the ones from the partners, whatever else.

[00:13:52.590] - Jenn
So since the direct traffic is so huge, we're going to skip that one. We're going to go to Google. So there's a couple of things you can do here. You can just highlight the traffic that's coming from Google. So as you can see it then kind of gray's out all of the traffic that's not coming from Google. But you can also go and view only the segment, which is more helpful in most cases. So we're going to go here.

[00:14:18.300] - Jenn
And what this is going to show you is where everybody that's coming from Google is going on your website. So in this case, there's some apparel that a lot of people are going to. So in this case, what it's showing us is that there are eight hundred and eighty two people that have come to this particular Web page. And what this through traffic and dropoffs means is that the through traffic is people who have clicked on this page.

[00:14:45.750] - Jenn
They've looked at it and they've gone to another page on your website.

[00:14:49.650] - Jenn
The dropoffs are people who have gone looked at the page and then not actually done anything. They've closed out the page and gone on to something else. Maybe they've gone to different search results or they've just they found what they wanted and they were like, I don't actually need that. And they've moved on. So knowing this can be really helpful, because if people are dropping off of a page a lot. So in this case, 84 percent of people are not staying on Google's merch store.

[00:15:18.210] - Jenn
After they go to this page, then that can tell you some things that might mean that you're not giving people what the search result promised. So maybe they're searching for women's apparel and they're coming to this page. And the page is not exactly what they were expecting. Maybe it's not the type of apparel that they wanted or it's not men's apparel or something like that. But regardless, it means typically that people are not finding what they want. So you can go ahead and optimize your Web site.

[00:15:51.810] - Jenn
Based on that. We are going to go ahead and highlight the traffic that does continue through here. So when they come to this page, most people then go on to men's apparel. So if you have a lot of people going to a particular page after that, then that's a pretty good sign that you can optimize it based on that. In this case, you can see now, once those ninety seven people have gone through to this page from that first page, 78 percent are sticking with it.

[00:16:20.190] - Jenn
They're going to multiple pages on this website. Only 21 people out of the ninety seven dropped off, stopped browsing the website, so then we'll highlight the traffic further through there and you can see it continue. So the more pages that someone views, the more likely it is that they're going to continue viewing more pages. So if you can back link in your blog posts, that is going to really help keep people on the site. And the longer they stay on the site, the more valuable they tend to be, the more likely they are to buy something.

[00:16:53.150] - Jenn
So going into the users flow report can really help you figure out where people are going so that you can provide the best back links. You can make sure that either you're giving them the information that they want if they're having to search for something, and you could just go and give them a back link to it. It makes it a lot easier on them and it means that they're more likely to stay on your Web site. So those are some of my top tips for what to look for in Google Analytics to optimize your blog or Web site and what to actually do with them once you have found them.

[00:17:28.190] - Jenn
If you have any questions, shoot me an email at hello@virtualSummitsearch.com. And if you don't have Google Analytics set up yet, I have a free Google Analytics 101 course that you can grab to go ahead and get that going, I hope this helps and I can't wait to see what you do with your new Google Analytics information.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.200] - Kim Anderson, kimandersonconsulting.com
Hi and welcome to my presentation, so you may be wondering, who the heck is this chick if you've never met me before? My name is Kim Anderson from KimAndersenConsulting.com, and I have a six figure online business. I am a thrifty lifestyle blogger, Podcaster ,online business coach and traditionally published book author. I've been doing online business since 2013 and in 2017 my blog business made enough money that my husband quit his electrical engineering career. He is now bootstrapping a nano brewery in our small town.

[00:00:34.500] - Kim
In addition to all these things, I also have twins. They were born in 2016 and are growing and growing and growing, as well as my eight year old, very energetic son. So I definitely have my hands full as people like to point out on a regular basis. In this presentation, I just want to go through these 10 steps, like step by step. Hopefully this will be very actionable for you when we get through this presentation.

[00:00:59.820] - Kim
And I'm hoping some of you guys have some great aha moments that help you be able to create a new stream of passive income or more than one on your blog. So let's talk about step one. So step one is to understand the warm up process funnels, which is what we're talking about today, are the marketing strategy that helps you compel someone to take the action you want them to take. And in most cases, there are three types of someones that we're going to be dealing with as bloggers, and that is cold, warm and hot audiences.

[00:01:29.580] - Kim
And there may be a multitude of actions that we would like this people to take on a regular basis from likes, to followers, to subscribes, to sign ups, getting them to join our tribe or buy something. These are all things that we can try to get people to do. But today, we're going to focus on a funnel that gives every new subscriber the chance to buy a physical or digital product from you, which is very exciting. Let's talk about cold audiences to get started.

[00:01:56.310] - Kim
So these are people who come to your blog who may have no idea who you are. They may just kind of stumbled upon, like maybe your YouTube channel. Maybe they just landed on your website. They just found you on Instagram. Basically, they just learn that you exist and they don't know if they like you yet. And I made a note here under our little snowy friend that says these people are the hardest to get to take an action because you haven't really established a relationship with them yet.

[00:02:24.390] - Kim
Our next group is the warm audience, these are people who have probably heard about you potentially from someone else, maybe they've seen some of your content and they like it and they may have stumbled on you and stumbled upon you on Pinterest. And they're kind of navigating your Web site, looking around or reading your about me page, whatever it is.

[00:02:42.660] - Kim
But they at least like you, and they at least feel like they know of you at this point. So there is my note here under Mr. Smiley Friend, is that it's easier to get these people taking action because they may already like you and feel like they know of you.

[00:02:57.720] - Kim
Our last audience is hot audiences. These are true fans. These people love your content. They follow you.

[00:03:04.110] - Kim
They comment on all your videos or feeds, they actually like you. And they may feel like they may feel like they actually know you. And most importantly, they feel like they can trust you. And trust really is that game changer and getting people to buy what is that we are selling.

[00:03:19.680] - Kim
So I made a note under our super fan over here that these people are the easiest to get to take an action because they, like, know and trust you already. And I really like these are the kind of people that we want to cultivate, but we can't always control that variable on our websites. We will at all times have cold, warm and hot audiences visiting us and we have no control over that. But as we go into this process of better understanding how we're working towards getting someone to take the action we want them to take, I want to walk you through this as like a prerequisite, because it's something that you should always keep in mind.

[00:03:54.960] - Kim
Ultimately, we want to take our audience members from cold to hot, so I have this little pretend little funnel over here and you can see I've got the cold guy, the warm guy and hot guy.

[00:04:04.200] - Kim
And ultimately we're trying to get them to get them at this bottom point so they'll make some decision. So when we talk about like a really simple funnel for growing your email list and keeping it warm, you may have been familiar with this simple funnel that you may or may not be already running on your own blog.

[00:04:23.150] - Kim
So basically, a person watches, reads or listens to your content and that content is usually free value that you're giving away. And at some point in that content, you're going to call them to action, asking them to sign up for an email list, plus a freebie. This is also free value.

[00:04:42.580] - Kim
Then they sign up and in most cases, a lot of people will set up a welcome sequence, and so they'll send a three email welcome sequence to help them get that the audience to get to know you and also to deliver maybe some more high value freebies to continue to warm these people up.

[00:04:57.690] - Kim
And then we follow up with these people by sending weekly communications to keep the list warm until you're ready to sell something, so that's kind of a traditional little funnel where our goal is to get people to take the action of signing up for our email list so that we can stay in communication with them. But for today, we're going to really be focusing on this funnel, a simple impulse offer email funnel for increased passive income from your own products.

[00:05:21.120] - Kim
So the way this would work is a person watches, reads or listens to your content again for your value. You call them, take an action. Hey, sign up for my email list, get my freebie and other free value. Except now they sign up and they are redirected to an opportunity to buy one of your products or a bundle of your products at 50 to 80 percent off. Hopefully 2.35% or more will buy your impulse offer. So this is the funnel that we're going to be discussing today.

[00:05:49.690] - Kim
This is the 10 steps we're going to walk through and try to talk about how to build one of these out. And then hopefully when you're done, you'll be able to go build the process for yourself, whether you already have one set up or not. Maybe it's time to set up another. OK, step two is to decide on a freebie and product upsell. So, OK, so impulse offers give you the chance to sell something to every single new subscriber on autopilot, which is why I love them.

[00:06:13.610] - Kim
There's no launching involved. It's literally like you have an opportunity with every single new person who subscribes to your list to make a sale and is completely passive. And so in this section, I really want to talk about six types of freebies. I want to talk about the multitude of products that you could sell just to kind of get the ball and the ideas rolling for you here. So usually when I teach this concept, people will ask me, OK, if I'm going to make a freebie, I'm going to make a product.

[00:06:42.260] - Kim
Which one do I make first? So it kind of is that chicken and egg scenario I kind of laugh about here. So you can see that we've got our upsell and we've got our offer being our freebie.

[00:06:52.760] - Kim
And so I tell people honestly, like really it's a process of figuring out what's going to work best for you. And sometimes people will create their product and then they'll pull a freebie out of the product or they'll think of a freebie that is connected with that product and that's easier for them. And then some people need to start with the freebie and then create the product off of the freebie. So to be honest with you, it doesn't really matter. The key is for you to just pick one kind of work through that process on your own.

[00:07:26.180] - Kim
OK, let's talk about the five types of email freebies.

[00:07:30.170] - Kim
There's obviously way more than this, but for the purposes of what we're going to be learning today, I'm just going to cover these five main types so you can have a site wide offer, a category specific offer, post specific offer, challenges or topic specific offers, since I'm going to break each of these down really quick. A site wide offer is one general offer geared towards your ideal audience on every single page of your website. Category specific freebies is one freebie or offer related to each category that you write about.

[00:08:04.830] - Kim
So if you have a WordPress website or any Web site and you let's say you have four categories that you write about all the time, you would be able to create a specific freebie geared towards each category and then have that freebie appear only in the content related to that category. Then you've got post specific offers. So this is one freebie offer related to the content of the article that you wrote, and I think sometimes these are some of the warmest offers that you can make.

[00:08:35.880] - Kim
And you may see the highest conversion rates on these because they're so specific to that particular article that you're writing. And if that's the case, it's probably a good idea for you to evaluate in your process of picking what's going to be the post that you basically monetize in this fashion, would be the one that has significant traffic. So you want to look at the ones that are already getting good, decent traffic or regular traffic, especially from like Google and things like that, because in that article, you're probably providing some sort of informational solution that people are looking for and having an offer in there, plus the upsell.

[00:09:11.320] - Kim
May be a high converting opportunity for you, but those are just things take into consideration. Like, obviously, you know, don't go looking for like your lowest traffic post. And then spend a bunch of time building out a product for that, look for the ones that are already doing well. Next, is challenges, a time a set time period or measurable finish line to accomplish something, and you can do this in so many different niches. They'll, they'll all usually work, and what I've seen a lot of people do with challenges related to freebies and products is it might be like a seven day challenge or a 30 day challenge.

[00:09:45.920] - Kim
And then people actually package up all the materials they've created for the challenge over the course of the seven days or the 31 days.

[00:09:54.260] - Kim
And they sell that as their upsell. Like, you don't have to wait for all the information to come out through email, like you can get it all in this one thing, plus this workbook.

[00:10:03.050] - Kim
So that works for some situations. Then there's topic specific offers. This is offering something related to a specific topic that you write about.

[00:10:11.090] - Kim
And how is it different from categories? I sort of think about this as being almost like subcategories. So it's just more specific to the topics that you might write about. So if you write about let's say you write about fitness, maybe that's, like one of your favorite topics under fitness to write about is kettlebell exercises. And so kettlebell exercise might be the topic that you may make your freebie based on the product that you sell. People would based on, be based on kettlebell.

[00:10:34.430] - Kim
So it's just more specific. OK, so if you're thinking like, I got to come up with some freebie ideas, the key here usually is to keep it simple. And there's a lot of people online.

[00:10:45.040] - Kim
I teach a lot of different things about freebies and what to give away and how much value to give away. And everybody kind of has different philosophies on how that works. But in my experience as a blogger, keeping it simple is best. Something like a plans library. I've seen people do before is like if you're into design or woodworking or furniture making or something. SVGs for those crafty people who are doing cricket, silhouette machines. Checklists, printable tutorials, mini e-books, mini courses, it could be a workbook Eguide, printable planner, quick win type items, challenges, PDFs, videos, lists, anything that can be kind of done for you.

[00:11:25.280] - Kim
So like, you know, if you can provide them with the items that they need or should do or some schedule to follow or something along those lines where you're providing it sort of done. So products or services that you can offer are e-books, merch, Physical Products, Commission work, online courses, trainings, printable plans, online workshops, events, templates, anything again, done for you. So if you're making some sort of product like let's say you're in the fitness industry and you want to make a exercise plan that is available like a 30 day exercise plan or a 30 day meal plan where people don't even have to think about it, it's just completely done.

[00:12:07.800] - Kim
So the question is, how do you brainstorm your products and freebie offer like this kind of some of the questions that I get from people is like, how do I kind of figure out what I'm going to do? And so I want to kind of give you some ideas of how to get the ball rolling to figure out what you're going to do for your own blog.

[00:12:23.030] - Kim
So when you think about number one, what's the problem that your audience is dealing with, like when you think about whatever whatever freebie offer you're thinking about doing, whether it's in post or across your website or whatever, get to the root of the problem that you're going to be able to solve. And then. Try to create a product that provides a solution to the problem. And then the next thing you want to ask is, well, if I got, if I know their problem and I know this product is the solution, really, what's the best format for me to deliver this particular solution to the audience that I have?

[00:13:01.450] - Kim
So rule number one, make sure that your freebie connects logically to your products and you would think this would be a no brainer.

[00:13:08.440] - Kim
But I've seen a lot of people who are sort of like slapping the stuff together because they just want to get it up and see how it does.

[00:13:14.680] - Kim
But there's an important process here where your freebie needs to make sense for the upsell so you don't want to have a freebie that is like, you know, the mom's, mom soccer van cleaning guide and then the upsell to a mini plan or something like that, unless it's like specifically geared towards like the soccer moms mini plan, like it needs to have some sort of logical connection.

[00:13:41.790] - Kim
You know, if you're going to give away like, you're going to do a checklist, maybe the upsell is the for like the full set of, like, checklist associated with something.

[00:13:51.960] - Kim
Maybe if you're going to give away like a cheat sheet, maybe the upsell is like a mini e-book that explains all the concepts on the sheet and how to implement them. But like those concepts should connect. You don't want to have a bunch of random freebies with a bunch of random things, because when someone gives you their email address in exchange for that freebie, they're indicating that they're interested in whatever that freebie is doing for them. And so the next logical step is to give them another solution to that problem they've just told you they have by opting in with their email address.

[00:14:26.460] - Kim
Rule number two is make sure that your product is in a format that makes sense for your audience. I don't, this is such a hard one because, again, there's so much information online coming from all kinds of different people who have so many different business models about like what's working.

[00:14:42.300] - Kim
And so one of my biggest frustrations in the blogging world, especially with all I mean, I've coached over 400 people and this is kind of one of those things I see constantly is there's people who are like, OK, this guru is saying this is the new way to make money online or this is the modern, like this is the today way to make money.

[00:15:00.240] - Kim
So, for example, people will go out and they'll create membership sites or something because that's the new big thing. And when they launch into their list, they get zero sales and they get very frustrated. But it was because they didn't take a step back and ask, is my particular audience interested or going or willing to pay for our membership? And that's like a super important question to ask yourself, as well as courses like if you, for example, have an audience of busy, busy professionals, for example, whether it's men or women, and you're trying to deliver your product in a way that they'll be able to consume it, it might be easier for those people to consume something that is in audio format that they can complete, like while they're commuting or on the bus or, you know, on train or whatever it may be like.

[00:15:46.500] - Kim
Really think about your target audience and what do they have time for? How do you make that easier for them? So for me, and my particular audience thirty little mom, I've shifted into more PDF based things because they can open as PDF wherever they are, carpool line, sitting around the house and they're on their phone and they can open them and they can read them versus women who just don't, you know, they have kids at home or whatever and they don't really have time to watch a ten minute video. So video is not going to be effective for them. Whereas, you know, like if you are a person in a more DIY niche and your audience wants to see your how to videos, you know, like that's what they're there for, like they need to see you do that project and some video would be more effective for them.

[00:16:30.030] - Kim
But it's very important for you to consider what format makes sense for your audience so that you actually make sales. Step number three is to make your freebie and your products. All right. There's so many different ways that you can make your freebie and your product these days and so many tools that make it so much easier.

[00:16:30.030] - Kim
So you've got programs like Canva, Stencil, Google Docs, YouTube, where you can, you know, upload your video and make it private and then be able to share it in an email or PDF or link in the PDF, password protected pages or an online school platform. So to create pretty looking PDFs and printables, I really encourage you guys to get into a program that helps you make professional looking things, the current programs out there that a lot of people use and are familiar with our Canva, PicMonkey's come a long way over the years to try to compete with Canva, in my opinion.

[00:17:19.650] - Kim
I still like Canva a lot of people already have Adobe, so they just use the Adobe Design programs and stuff. And then they're Stencil, which is sort of another version of like Canva.

[00:17:31.710] - Kim
But these are just options. So I have this image here where you can kind of see like the different things you can do, in particular just to make a note.

[00:17:41.820] - Kim
These this the screenshots that you see is templates made by Kara Fidd from simplifying DIY design, but she makes these awesome templates that you can change out and switch out. So that is her work and I want to make sure she gets credit for the designs and stuff.

[00:17:59.650] - Kim
So the next thing you can consider doing is create pro looking courses, and I personally think a lot of people use teachable, Kajabi and Podia are also two other options. But, you know, if creating courses is what you want to do, you have the option to be able to build those on a platform like these.

[00:18:19.050] - Kim
The next step is to make the offers look good and make the titles compelling, so I think it's really important to create better looking product covers. Again, you can use programs like Canva and Stencil. If you're really proficient with Adobe and you're in into design, you can make a lot of different things that way. I don't know Adobe as well, so I just default to my Ecover maker because it helps make these 3D looking images that have the bindings on them or computer screens or anything else.

[00:18:49.950] - Kim
Like it's just a easy program and it's inexpensive.

[00:18:52.620] - Kim
It's like $4.95 a download. And they also have free options too. So spend time making sure that your PDF documents cover image is compelling because that is what people are often making a decision based on.

[00:19:10.230] - Kim
The next thing is to avoid white noise titles, and my best example of this is home binder. So if you look on the left, this is a pretty white noise thing, a home binder. Yay, so exciting. So to encourage you guys to use power words, use transformational words and consider using time frames when it's appropriate. So you can see how I take in this white noise title of home binder and tried to make it more transform transformational by calling it the Bad Ass Mom's Guide to Total Home Management in thirty five minutes, which is a lot more compelling than home binder, because there's a bit of a promise or there's a bit of an expectation to that title.

[00:19:48.210] - Kim
And obviously you want to be able to deliver on whatever you title it.

[00:19:52.140] - Kim
But it's a much more compelling offer when you spend time on the title of your product. Step five is to set up your payment and delivery. This is one of those interesting processes which is different for pretty much every platform that you use, but in general, sort of the process in case you're new to selling online and you've never really done it before. I think this is one of those areas people get very confused about how things work. And it just again, it depends on the program that you're using.

[00:20:22.930] - Kim
But for a lot of people in my circles of blogging, this is sort of the the way things work.

[00:20:30.820] - Kim
You will get a product and delivery software so you can see that you've got our shopping cart and checkout because that's what we need for the consumer to be able to use. And that usually, that shopping cart and checkout has a way to deliver. That's why it kind of runs along the bottom, because this piece is connected to get it right. So you've got your checkout and then your delivery truck on the other side. And then I've got this thing down here that has a little packaging.

[00:20:57.910] - Kim
It says, these delivery softwares will charge you a small fee, your monthly subscription fee. And some of the examples of the ones that are most commonly used in my blogging community is sendowl shopify, Leadpages, teachable, thinkific, ThriveCart. So these are some of the major product delivery options out there. And once you get them set up, you will have to connect them to a secure payment processor.

[00:21:22.960] - Kim
And some of the most popular ones that are the most widely used ones are Stripe, Square and PayPal. And I made a note. So there's a little Pacman here that says two and a half to three and a half percent fee for each transaction. And I think a lot of people get concerned about these fees and stuff. But if you're creating digital products, I joke about basically we sell invisible things.

[00:21:44.740] - Kim
There's not a lot of margins when it comes to PDF and things like that because you're not having to print it, package it, ship it or anything. Right. Like there is somebody else kind of doing that for you and so for me, for the convenience of being able to process those payments securely and know that consumers information is being kept safe by Stripe's, Square, PayPal and I don't have to worry about that on my end or my responsibility of keeping that information safe, I will pay these fees.

[00:22:17.770] - Kim
And I will set these things up. So this is just kind of an idea of how that works. So once you get that secure processor in there, people go to their shopping cart, which is connected to the secure payment processor, which is then delivered by your product delivery software.

[00:22:33.220] - Kim
Step six is to write your welcome and delivery email sequence. So obviously when someone gets a freebie or purchases something, you need to be able to deliver that thing to them.

[00:22:44.770] - Kim
Some people with freebies opt to have them delivered in the first email of the welcome series because it gets the person to open the email.

[00:22:54.160] - Kim
And getting people to engage with your email when it comes into their inbox helps to make sure that your, your, your email gets in their inbox again. And in the future, like it sort of tells you know whatever their email service provider is, ""hey, this person engaged with email and must not be spam."" So that's why a lot of times in my welcome sequence, my very first email is delivering the freebie because I want them to go open that, whereas I've seen a lot of people who, when they deliver their freebie, do it on a thank you page or something like that.

[00:23:24.340] - Kim
I want people to go into that email.

[00:23:24.340] - Kim
I don't want to give them the freebie immediately on the thank you page because I need them to check that email to make sure that I am being able to email them again in the future and that I'm not going to spam. So this is an example, email, welcome sequence, if you never created one, this is just an example. There are a million ways you could do this, but this is just something to kind of get your brain going.

[00:23:49.180] - Kim
In this case. I've got email one as a greeting, you know, delivering the freebie and telling them what they can expect from you and what's in it for them and the information about you. And I usually ask them to hit reply and say hi or answer a question, because, again, this helps to create engagement inside of those e-mail delivery services in hopes that that continues to help us get into their inbox on a regular basis.

[00:24:13.990] - Kim
Email number two, two days later, could be a quick email that you give something of value away for free, a video or a printable or something like that. Email number three, which can be five days after email. Number one would be a quickie, another quick email with another value add item like a freebie or a video or training or something along those lines.

[00:24:32.620] - Kim
And then email number four, you can add them to the weekly email announcements, set up an RSS feed, and so you're ready to email them with more personal note. But this is sort of just a general email welcome sequence that you can set up.

[00:24:46.550] - Kim
Step seven is to create your landing pages so there is different kinds of landing pages, if you're not familiar with what they are. You can create landing pages for your freebie as well as landing pages for your upsell. So I want to talk briefly about the benefits of landing pages, in case you're not familiar with them, landing pages are a little bit different than just regular pages that you would build in Gutenberg. So if you were to create a page in Gutenberg, unless you've got a little bit of coding background when you hit publish on that page, you're probably still going to have your menu at the top and your logo or whatever you have going on at the top of your page.

[00:25:24.170] - Kim
And landing pages are supposed to be very minimal, distraction free. So you can get rid of those menus and stuff. They're supposed to give a direct call to action.

[00:25:35.780] - Kim
You should be able to keep it simple, like when you're especially when you're doing the freebies with the blanks for the name and email, visible send pins, and you can send pins and people directly to landing pages, Mailerlite and Convertkit, even have a built-In landing page templates now. But the key part of this is no matter how you get your landing pages, whether you're using your own email service or whatever, that, you know, these are going to be very distraction free.

[00:26:03.800] - Kim
Like it's very focused on getting that person to take the action without distraction. No ads, none of that. So here's an example of one of the ones that was in Convertkit. OK, so a lot of people say, well, how do I build these landing pages, right? So there's a lot of different ways you can do it.

[00:26:22.600] - Kim
Like I said, you might be a little bit more clunky and harder to work with to get it to be really minimal and without distraction, because you're going to have to you know, you have to go in and make sure that your pop ups are off and things like that. Landing page plugins come like come in different brands like Elementor or beaverbuilder or Thrive and you know, the names of the companies or the products that are out there for plugins that basically just put a pretty landing page kind of over like an overlay is what I think about it, like digitally, like a digital overlay of a page on your website.

[00:26:56.560] - Kim
And so instead of it having the menu and stuff, these plugins are page builders, and you can do some drag and drop. And they also have like premade themes, like where people have made nice looking landing pages and you can basically use those templates and those landing page templates and you can change out the titles and you can change out the fonts and colors in the background, like you can fully customize it. But the templates are nice, because it kind of gives you a framework to start with and then you can put your own things on there.

[00:27:27.310] - Kim
Email marketing services like Convertkit could also have landing pages. Like I mentioned before, a lot of the shops and schools like thinkific and Teachable and Kajabi and Podia have landing pages now and then there's the external option, which is Leadpages, which typically is a more expensive one. And I've heard of things like Clickfunnels and things like that. So there's just a lot of options out there and it really just depends on your personal goals and your budget.

[00:27:50.560] - Kim
So you'll be wondering what's so special about an impulse sales page, right? So that's what we're talking about today in particular. And honestly, it usually starts with a thank you and expectations set. So you say, hey, thank you so much for subscribing. That's on the way to the inbox for you right now. So that you're you're letting them know like, hey, like what you signed up for is happening right now. And then it makes a very direct quick offer with a significant discount.

[00:28:16.050] - Kim
The offer being whatever the product is that you're giving away at a significant discount and usually has a buy now button and a countdown timer at 10 to 12 minutes, again, it's an impulse offer. It should have a picture and information about you, it can have testimonials and that, you know, that's kind of up to you. Whether or not you've got testimonials yet for your product, it doesn't have to. I think that the picture and information about you in this case is important.

[00:28:39.970] - Kim
And no, it's not a full sales page. Remember, this is an impulse offer. So whereas a full sales page, you're really having to take a cold audience and really warm them up because the price point on the product is higher or something like that, you know, that would that would include like doing a little bit more copywriting, a little bit more compelling copy, you know, testimonials, really communicating what's in it for them, because you are trying to, you know, take, get people take that action and that action is going to require a lot of trust.

[00:29:12.520] - Kim
But in this case, there's an impulse sale which requires some trust, but not the same as what it would be for a full sales page, because this product is a discount. Like it's like just like at the grocery store, those impulse purchases that you make at the candy bars or the magazines, you know, this is you getting that chance. And you may have seen this if you've ever ordered anything from like Vistaprint or something like when you go to check out, there's just a little bit much because they're like offer, offer, offer, offer, get this for discount, you know, get a pen with a logo on it or whatever.

[00:29:38.470] - Kim
Important variable number one about these impulse sales pages is that you do want to create a sense of urgency. You can do this using countdown timers. You know, the sale ends at this date. Last call emails, whatever it may be. So then you got to start thinking about your sales copy. And if you're not really familiar with this or this is something that you're kind of weak in, I highly recommend Kate Doster's programs because she's really good at copywriting.

[00:30:04.660] - Kim
But the number one thing is tell your audience about the problem that you know they have. So you want to identify that and you want to be able to tell them that what you have to offer then solves that problem. And on the sales page, you want to help them understand what life is going to continue to look like.

[00:30:18.130] - Kim
Without that, hopefully you know, it's going to probably suck and then help them understand what life will look like when they do have it. Which is going to be amazing. And then you ask them to buy now and find a way to add urgency and or scarcity. So that's a very simplified version. But this is kind of what we're trying to communicate as quickly as possible on this upsell. I mean, on this upsell or impulse offer page. So step eight is to set up the funnel in your email marketing service.

[00:30:43.870] - Kim
Email marketing post opt in redirects, is kind of where you get this done. And so this is a picture from inside of Convertkit, and if you use Convertkit the key in an email email marketing product is when you're creating your opt in your form, whatever they want to call it in that software is that you need to look for what happens when a visitor subscribes to the page or to the form. And in this case, you need it,  like in this case I've changed it on Convertkit to redirect to an external page.

[00:31:11.110] - Kim
And that's where I'm going to post the url of the sales page that I previously created and published.

[00:31:18.950] - Kim
Then you need to set up an automation usually with this, and so this is inside of Convertkit. So you can see that in this, the first two red squares of the top are my forms. And these are two different forms that I have in my website that both go to the same email sequence.

[00:31:33.530] - Kim
But you want to get these set up and turn that thing on so that when someone opts into your form or onto your page, it triggers for that email sequence to go out on autopilot because this is where we start getting into the passive autopilot income.

[00:31:48.260] - Kim
Step 10 is to wait, watch, document, tweak and test.

[00:31:51.170] - Kim
Which I know is a lot in one step, but it's really about tweaking, testing, tweaking, testing. So the next question people usually ask me is like, how do I know if this is working?

[00:31:59.570] - Kim
And, you know, it's important to know that you're not going to get a sale each time somebody pops in your email list. So if you have this set up to where you have this impulse offer, not every single person who subscribes to your email list is going to take that impulse offer, their just not, because going to depend on variables like copy, it's going to depend on how warm your audience is and if they want that thing.

[00:32:21.500] - Kim
So as a target, the industry kind of standard of percentages is 2.35% or more conversions. And that means it's probably like an effective sales page and you're around the average mark, if you can get five to 10 percent, that's even better. That's really good. That's a good indicator that you've created something that is connecting with your freebie and also connecting with your audience. So I feel like, well, how do I calculate that information?

[00:32:46.730] - Kim
To be able to calculate your conversion rate on pretty much anything that you're testing, is the total action. So what does those actions that you want those people to take? So if it's purchase, that's the action. If it's subscribed, that's the action divided by the total number of people that saw that offer. So you could go into Google Analytics, for example, and look and see how many people were on that landing page versus the number of people who actually purchased.

[00:33:10.880] - Kim
And that starts to give you a conversion rate, information that you can use to make decisions about how well things are going for you and if you need to tweak or make changes.

[00:33:20.160] - Kim
So your challenge after listening to this talk is to set up a strategic freebie, plus a trip wire or impulse offer, there's a different name for these things on your site in the next 12 weeks on your blog. And you may be like 12 weeks! I don't need 12 weeks, but you'll be surprised if you don't already have a product available like you may need to make a product and that can take some time, even if it's a small thing to get all those pieces in place.

[00:33:44.610] - Kim
Because you have to remember, this was a 10 step process where you have to come up with it. You know, you have to make it.

[00:33:44.610] - Kim
You have to connect all the pieces of the payment processor and get all uploaded, get the sales page made, make your welcome series. Like there's a lot of pieces of this puzzle and you'll give yourself time to work on it, whether it's six weeks or 12 weeks and give yourself a little bit of a deadline. You can be making passive income in a very short period of time on total autopilot. So I'd love for you to see if you can create an instant source of new income that was not there before.

[00:34:15.390] - Kim
That happens while you sleep.

[00:34:18.050] - Kim
So if you guys have enjoyed this talk and you know right now, which I'm guessing because this is like a 30 minute presentation, that there was a lot of information that was presented that you may have gotten some ideas or some aha moments.

[00:34:30.110] - Kim
But you know that you probably need to revisit the information when you're sitting down and can really focus and think through these things. I want to give you guys some free cheat sheets for this challenge that I laid out for you. So I made the special pack to help make sure that you can take your knowledge from today's workshop and put it to work. So this is my step by step impulse offer cheatsheets, which you should be able to get in my presentation area, like there's maybe a button or something that has a link to these freebies that are here.

[00:34:58.640] - Kim
Thank you guys so much for your attention and your time. And whatever you do, just keep blogging.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:10.040] - Krista Walsh, kristawalshcopywriter.co
Hello and welcome to my presentation. It's all about how to write your about page to connect emotionally with your readers. So, you're going to learn how to build trust on the second most visited page on your website, which is, of course, your about page. So, before we get started, I just want to introduce myself for those of you who don't know me, I am Krista Walsh and I'm an SEO website copywriter for small business owners and creatives. So, basically, this means that I create the messaging for my clients websites, so that a couple of really important things happen.

[00:00:48.980] - Krista
The first thing is, that their website gets found on Google by people who are actively typing in what they have to offer, and to then their website takes those visitors on a journey from that very first impression all the way to becoming a paying customer or lead in their inbox.

[00:01:09.870] - Krista
Okay, so let's jump right in and start talking about why your about page matters in the first place. So, I think we all know that you're about page matters, but I brought up some stats here to kind of prove it.

[00:01:22.410] - Krista
So, the first one is that 52% of website visitors want to see a company's about page right after landing on their home page. So, over half of people are going right to the about page after they land on a company homepage, which says a lot about how much customers really care about learning about companies.

[00:01:43.960] - Krista
Also, 81% of consumers buy based on how much they trust a brand. 86% of consumers say that authenticity is a deciding factor when their purchasing. And 77% of consumers want to support people who share their values.

[00:02:03.120] - Krista
So, these last three statistics are really important because this is all stuff that an about page helps you do. It helps you build trust, it helps you establish authenticity, and it helps you show people who you are, like what values you espouse. A lot of the stuff that consumers are looking for, they're going to go looking for it on your about page, and your about page is the perfect place to show them all of this.

[00:02:30.570] - Krista
So, in short, a good about page establishes your blog or business or brand as trustworthy, authentic and relatable. So, how do we get there? That's what we're going to learn today.

[00:02:46.530] - Krista
So, to start, I want to share the top three about page mistakes that I see all the time as a Web site copywriter and just make sure that you are avoiding making these as you sit down to write or edit your about page.

[00:03:01.080] - Krista
So, the first one is throwing away your headline. So, what I mean by this is not using your headline wisely on your about page in particular. So, a lot of times people will write their headline, and it just says about or about me or possibly my story or they won't have any headline at all on this page, they'll just jump right into a photo of me and here is my little bio. Or sometimes their headline will just be like, ""Hi, I'm Krista"", for example. So this is a mistake because eight out of ten people only read the headlines on any given Web page. So, your headline has to do one of two things on every Web page. And you're about Page is not an exception.

[00:03:52.190] - Krista
Your headline either has to give away the most important information, kind of like a newspaper headline. So, for the people who aren't going to bother to read the rest, you want them to get it just from that headline. Or it has to be enticing enough to help people want to read the rest of the copy on your page. And these examples here, like just saying about or not having a headline or just simply like stating your name and your headline those don't accomplish either of those two things.

[00:04:25.740] - Krista
So, here's a really great example of a common style of headlines that I see on about pages. So, you have to scroll down really, really far to actually get to the meat of this page. And all we get way above the fold is about me. And that doesn't really help us learn anything new about this company and it doesn't help us want to read the rest of this page.

[00:04:50.470] - Krista
So, mistake number two is what I say, what I call keeping it corporate. So, these are about pages that feel like they're ripped right from a business plan. So, they have like a mission statement and a vision statement possibly. There's not really a personal story. Everything is written from this vague we, so we don't really know who's talking to us in this moment. Sometimes there are stock images and all of this is a mistake because remember why people are going to your about page and what a good about page does; builds trust, it's relatable, establishes authenticity. And an about page that feels super corporate and vague and boring does none of those things. So, this is really a missed opportunity if you think you need to be super professional on your about page.

[00:05:47.420] - Krista
So, this is an example of kind of a middle of the road in the corporate zone about pages from a client of mine, before we wrote her about page. So, this is her previous page. And just everything from the design to how it's written just feels very corporate and a little bit boring and doesn't truly reflect the really personal nature of her service. So, she says things like, ""I hand-select exceptionally talented, credentialed and ambitious writers who are laser focused on putting client needs first, etcetera."" And that just reads very job interviewee. And it's not what clients need to hear in order to feel really connected to your brand. So this was a missed opportunity for her company.

[00:06:34.590] - Krista
So, mistake number three is an interesting one, and it is when I see really, really often and that is simply making your about page kind of hard to find. So, usually this goes two ways. So, either hiding the link way in your Web site footer and not having it in that top navigation, so you don't have a tab at the top that says about it's just in your website footer.

[00:07:00.180] - Krista
So you're expecting readers to really hunt around for your about page. And that's a missed opportunity because a lot of them won't find it. They won't bother to find it. And then you're losing out on that that chance to make this, like, really deep connection with them. And then two, people who are having to look for it sort of feel a little bit like weird about that, like why why can't I find it? Is this company real? Like, they don't have a story I wrote about. And then the second way people make their about page hard to find, is by naming it something cute and warm in the navigation. This one, I think, is one that a lot of people are surprised to find it's a mistake. So, people who name there their about page tab at the top like my journey. Our story. Explore our past or, I don't know, something that feels very clever and warm and you can tell what they're trying to do, but actually a lot of people won't recognize that as an about page. And so, they're just going to not find what they're looking for and feel a little weird. Also, Google likes things named really clearly, so that when they crawl your site map, they know how to categorize a page, and an about page of something that they're going to want to pop up. When somebody types in your business and Google, you want that about Page showing up. Right. And naming it something cute will maybe prevent that from happening. So, save the warmness for the copy on your about page and just make it really straightforward because we've got to get people there first, and then you can be clever and cute and fun once you're once they're there.

[00:08:45.380] - Krista
So, Larabar is actually a good example of a company that did this. So, they have to tabs actually they have one that says our story and one that says our values. And if I were were doing their page, I would just have it say about and then include both their story and their values in one place; because that's where people are naturally going to look for it.

[00:09:08.450] - Krista
Okay, so now that we've gone through these mistakes, I want to share the three about page writing secrets that if you get nothing out of this presentation, I want you to get these. So, pay attention. Feel free to screenshot any of the slides or the examples, especially that I'm giving here, so you can refer back to them later as you're writing or editing your own about page.

[00:09:32.090] - Krista
So, secret number one, share what you do or offer as clearly as possible in your H1. So, your H1 is your main headline at the top of the page. So, remember when I said that your headline needs to either give people that newspaper style of here is- here, here's the whole story and a headline, or it needs to entice people to keep reading. So, if you're not a copywriter, I recommend doing the first one because it's- you can't make a mistake there.

[00:10:07.610] - Krista
So, give readers the through line that they're looking for when they're heading to your about page. So, some ways to share what you do or offer as clearly as possible in your headline is to just state your unique selling proposition. So, that's the answer to the question of why or how are you different or why people should hire you or buy from you. You could use the formula, I help blank do blank so that they can blank and just make that sentence your headline. You could even really make your mission really concise into one sentence and just make that your headline. So, here's an example. So, Gary, Gary Schultz of Inward Voyage was a client of mine, and I did some strategic editing of his website. And this is how we changed his about page. So, originally he had this throwaway about page headline that just said about Gary Schultz, and I changed it to share his mission instead. So, now it's a ""Through and word voyage, my mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit."" So, right away, even if people don't read anything else, they're getting the vibe of Gary's business and they just get a lot more out of this.

[00:11:25.930] - Krista
And it also does inspire them to read a little bit more than just about Gary. Right. So, secret number two is to use a story framework. So, this is for anybody who feels like, you know, I want to share my story, I love stories, but my story is so all over the place, it's kind of wishy washy or I just don't know how to condense it into something that people will remember. Screenshot this slide because this is for you. And surprise, a lot of people feel that way because life is not this beautiful, tight narrative. We have to sort of massage it to fit into there so that our brains can remember it. And that's totally okay.

[00:12:10.440] - Krista
So, when you're using this framework, the biggest thing you need to have in mind is this general idea of a transformation that you experienced either related to what you sell or offer or related to the why you started your business. So, sometimes those are one of the same, sometimes they're different, either one. So, just have that in mind.

[00:12:35.240] - Krista
And big picture, we want to give people a before picture before you have that transformation, that really specific turning point. So, the moment when something changed, then the after picture, how your life is better or different now and then we don't want to just end there. We don't want to end the story with the end of your story. We want to remember that we're talking to customers here. So then we have to pivot it and say, you know, this is my offer.

[00:13:06.860] - Krista
Here's how I can help you now. So a great way to use this general framework is to use the Pixar storytelling framework. And I've got that up on the screen here and basically. It's once upon a time there was me, so you were me, right? This is you're basically stating where you were before and then the next to your reiterating, well, you're digging a little bit deeper into your story, into your story before.

[00:13:38.610] - Krista
So every day I would do this or think this and it was horrible. Then one day something changed. And then because of that, I did this or I had this negative or positive experience. And then because of that, I actually tried something new or I sought help or had this wave of clarity. And then finally, I found a solution, I realized something profound, I solved my problem, and then now everything is better for me. And then at the end just say, and now I can help you get this solution to.

[00:14:15.550] - Krista
So. This is a lot and it's kind of hard to wrangle together. But I want to give you an example of what this can look like. So, this is a client of mine, Nina Lohman, and she runs a company called Indica Dreams, which is a CBD company, and I wrote her about page for her loosely using that Pixar storytelling framework.

[00:14:40.970] - Krista
So, if you want to screenshot this, I'll move my little picture out of the way to give you an idea of how you can get creative with this framework and how it can flow and be really memorable. So. She starts off, you know, we share her before, which is she found out her mom had cancer, she was really scared. We dig deep into this before state and then something happened for her. Right. She found CBDs. And then because of that, she starts researching it. She starts experimenting on herself. Because of that, she decides to actually pursue it full time, getting a degree in alternative medicine. And then finally she starts her company to solve this problem for everyone else. And at the end, we have this neat little pivot back to the reader and we say, ""This is where Indica Dreams comes in a CBD brand for people who want to thrive. I'm so glad you found us.""

[00:15:48.430] - Krista
So, secret number three, is that you can share more than just your story, so I love the story part of about pages, but you can also share other things to help build trust and authenticity and be relatable. And some of those I have you have up here on the screen so you can share your mission. You could share your why. So, why you started your business, what keeps you going, your values. That's a really good one to kind of break up the tax and give people a quick hit idea of what you're all about, your commitments to causes. If you do any donations or if you volunteer, you just really passionate about a cause. And fun facts; so something that's a little bit lighter, you know, like are you a coffee person or a tea person? Those are great ideas to share.

[00:16:43.380] - Krista
So, here's an example of a client of mine, and we included this value section that was both her values and the design of her jewelry. She's a jewelry company and also her values as a person.

[00:16:56.130] - Krista
And so people can read these and feel like, yeah, this is what I'm looking for in a company, or, hey, these values feel good to me. This is what I have to do. And it's just another way to establish that trust and relatability on your about page.

[00:17:11.430] - Krista
Okay, bonus secret- actually, I said there were three, but here's a bonus one, remember that your about page is part of the customer journey. So, if you're thinking you're going to write your about page in a vacuum. So, this is especially for folks who want to sit down and think about it like a bio. So, you're like, I just got to have my photo and like my little LinkedIn bio and that's my about page. And it's sort of separate from the rest of my website. No. You're about Page is very much part of this whole customer journey, which means it's part of your job as a sales person to sell yourself for your products or your brand.

[00:17:55.830] - Krista
So, I'm going to give you an example of a page that I helped one of my clients with to showcase some of the ways that you can think about your about page as part of this big sales journey that your customers go through. So, my client Merchant Method, this is her about page and a lot of the first half is her story. So, that's what all of this is. And then, of course, we have this pivot here at the end. Bringing it back to the reader and then this is really what I want to talk about, this section here. So, at the end of her about page, she didn't just leave the customer saying, ""Well, that was my story. Wasn't that nice?"" Because she's thinking about her about page in terms of her larger customer journey. So, she wants them to not stop on her about page because she can't make a sale on her about page. Instead, she wants to funnel them back to where she wants to funnel them back to. So, for some of you, that might be adding a call to action that simply says shop. But for my client, it was to add them to her email funnel. So, she had an invitation to stay in touch by taking the retail success style quiz, which fed them into a really, really successful email funnel of hers.

[00:19:31.260] - Krista
So, whatever you want people to do next, whether it's shop, checkout or services page, join your email list, follow you on Instagram. Where do you want this journey to go next after your about page? And you need to have something at the end to push people where you want them to go. Don't just let the journey end here.

[00:19:56.570] - Krista
Okay, so I'm sharing this this is my client, Mike, because I just want you to know what's possible for you when you really have this emotional connection with your readers on your website, including on your about page.

[00:20:11.210] - Krista
So, Mike is a portrait photographer, and he experienced an immediate spike in client inquiries directly from his website, from strangers who found him online in the height of a pandemic. So, being a portrait photographer, this is not something that just, you know, that people were like clambering to spend money on in the middle of covid-19. But because his website made such a powerful emotional connection, people were feeling it. And they're like, ""I want you."" And he says, ""I've gotten half a dozen increases in the past month and consistently get compliments on the website. Not only that, no one bats an eye at my pricing. I've never been in this situation before. People see my value and want to hire me no questions asked.""

[00:20:58.070] - Krista
Wouldn't that be amazing if your website could have this connection with people and just do this for you before you even get them on the phone or before you have to email them or take them for this long marketing funnel? Right. So, that's what's possible for you when you really nail this.

[00:21:18.040] - Krista
So, I have given you a lot here to make your about page awesome and actually sell for you. But I know it's a lot. So, you can also download a lot of this information, plus additional information and a really easy to follow checklist that you can have beside you as you're writing your about page, her editing your current about page. It's free and you can grab it at www.KristaWalshcopyrighter. Com/aboutpage checklist. So, screenshot of this page if you want to remember that link.

[00:21:59.880] - Krista
All right, at this point, let's open it up for any questions that you might have, I'd love to answer them.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.910] - Lanie
Hello, blogger breakthrough attendees. Listen, I know marketing is getting harder, and I want to do a little presentation on why it's happening and what you can do about it. And I wanted to get on the screen just for a minute because I know this is going to be kind of slide heavy, but I want to show you I'm a real person. In fact, who am I? I'm Lanie Lamarre. I'm going to get off the screen now. My jam is to show you literally using visualization tools how you will achieve the business you want, whether that's with workflows for your processes, which was how I got started in the online world, creating and implementing workflows for service providers.

[00:00:49.370] - Lanie
But now I also include and love dashboards that simplify how you see your online performance or using profitability calculator to show you exactly what it is, you need to see a return on investment that you're looking for or visualizing your projects in a way that makes it easier for you to take action on with Airtable or working through your CEO days with numbers and strategies and plans and values that you can actually map out. And you find all of these resources over at omgrowth.com that's O-M-G-R-O-W-T-H. I am also the host of the omgrowth podcast, which is in its second season, and this presentation is actually repurposed from a series of podcasts I did on the iOS updates.

[00:01:30.930] - Lanie
And let's be real. Why the hey you should care about the iOS updates and why the hey it matters to you. So, if you're picking up what I'm throwing down here, I encourage you to check out the oh my Growth podcast and subscribe. I do want to start this conversation off by saying, Listen, I'm not your attorney and in no way am I providing you with legal counsel at this time. If you have any doubts or concerns, I encourage you to reach out to a legal professional who can comment on your specific situation and needs.

[00:01:57.890] - Lanie
If there's something that you need help with, finding somebody like that, by all means, reach out to me. But having said that, I'm qualified to discuss the subject as I used to be a data Privacy officer, I'm still a card carrying member of the IAPP, which is the International Association of Privacy Professionals. What is a data Privacy officer? Well, it's someone whose job it is to enforce Privacy legislation as it relates to your personal information, how it's being collected, how it's being used, shared, disclosed, all those fun things.

[00:02:26.730] - Lanie
And you would be surprised about the liberties with which your personal information has been collected, used, shared, and disclosed online. In fact, I was in the industry and I'm still surprised on a regular basis and to provide you with a little example, a little taste of that. I just posted a video on my Instagram feed at oh my Growth to demonstrate how popular websites like CNN. Com, for instance, are monetizing your personal information by sharing it with way more advertisers than you may realize or would even consent to.

[00:02:59.180] - Lanie
I'm using a free Chrome extension to check out what the tracking is on a popular site like CNN.com.

[00:03:05.050] - Lanie
We can see that they have 45 potential trackers. It's a third party cookies tracking my behavior, most of which are advertising companies.

[00:03:13.910] - Lanie
So when you look at companies like Facebook and Google making record profits and positioning its leaders as the wealthiest people in the world, these are companies we all use and none of us pay for. But you have to realize that the reason these services are free is because you, my online friend and all of your online data are the product that they are selling, that they're monetizing. Now, of course, this isn't you, at least not in Internet years. And again, speaking in internet years, the data Privacy legislation in place to protect you isn't exactly new either.

[00:03:46.340] - Lanie
So, let's take a brief overview and go back to the future of the worlds of Privacy and marketing colliding. If you're an online veteran who's been in the online world for over four years or so, you will recall the chicken little panic brought on by the general data protection regulation put in place by the European Union in 2016. This is also called GDPR, and by 2018 the EU, European Union would begin to enforce this two year old regulation to give individuals the right and control over how their personal information was being used for commercial purposes.

[00:04:23.430] - Lanie
And what's so wrong with that, right. Now, this may not be the proudest moment of marketers and online business people. It wasn't a good look for us because we became like, opera level dramatic over how this would end and totally ruin all of our email lists and reach. And if you were a grossy pants and ethical marketer, that was a very fair conclusion for you to draw. But for the rest of us just trying to offer value to people who actually wanted it. GDPR mostly meant that we had to add a little checkbox to our forums that said.

[00:04:53.880] - Lanie
Hey, do you consent to keeping in touch with us?

[00:04:56.840] - Lanie
We tend to glaze over the fact that around the same time that GDPR was enforced, California was actually putting similar regulations in place. But we'll get back to California in a minute. We'll go back to Cali in a moment because I want to talk about Google and Privacy first, because the following year after GDPR was enforced, we're talking August 2019. Google launched what is called the Privacy Sandbox Capital P Capital S. This was created as a means of putting Web standards in place for websites to access information about its users without compromising their Privacy.

[00:05:30.270] - Lanie
Now, since we're getting into fun facts about yours truly, I also have a real pet peeve with the term users. I wish we would just come to a consensus over another term because who speaks about their clients using terminology like users other than maybe drug dealers. I kind of frown on how exploited if the word user sounds, but maybe that's the point. But my irritations and I digress. Because in January 2020, Google announced that they will render third party cookies obsolete in 2022. Now, in June of this year 2021, they actually pushed that deadline back out to 3, 2023.

[00:06:11.200] - Lanie
But it's an important move on Google's part, and it's one that you want to understand because it's going to and probably currently is affecting you. So, what the hey are cookies and third party cookies and all this fun stuff? Well, cookies are the little blocks of data, including your personal information, especially your personal information, to make it possible for your browser activity to be tracked across platforms. Now you have things called first party cookies, and these are the ones that store information on the domain you're visiting.

[00:06:40.200] - Lanie
So, an example of this because I love examples, when Amazon recognizes that you added that new bestseller to your cart on your last visit and it's still sitting in your cart the next time you log into Amazon, well, that's first party cookies in action. Third party cookies, though, are the ones that store information across other domains you're visiting. For instance, when you're scrolling through your Facebook feed and you're targeted with an ad for a T-shirt relating to the bestseller that you were looking over on Amazon.

[00:07:10.620] - Lanie
That's third party cookie in action. Third party cookies are the stuff that your aunt gets worked up at over holiday dinner party for being so creepy. And she's not wrong because the Safari browser agrees. And as of August 2020, it also blocked the use of third party cookies. It's all happening, and it's only a matter of time before all the other browsers are also on board with this blocking of third party cookies.

[00:07:35.600] - Lanie
So, now, I promise we'd come back to Kelly, and here we are with the CCPA that is the California Consumer Privacy Act very familiar to GDPR. But instead of protecting the personal information of EU residents, this one protects residents of California. It was created back in 2018, but as of July 2020, it was announced that this act would be enforced. Again. It's all happening. It's just a matter of time before other States and countries get on board with this precedent, you should fully anticipate these Privacy laws becoming to a region near you.

[00:08:07.460] - Lanie
Furthermore, GDPR and California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA, these don't just apply to people who live in the European Union or to California residents. These only protect these specific residents. But regardless of where you are, you have an obligation as an online marketer to abide by these Privacy laws. So, if consent isn't already part of your opt in, you want to consider implementing that. If you were marketing inclusively to California residents or European Union residents. Now, if you're exclusively regional to your area, this may not be an issue for you at this point, but again, it's just a matter of time. Because we have the browsers prioritizing privacy and we have governments doing the same.

[00:08:51.700] - Lanie
And what we are seeing with the Apple updates that everyone is freaking out about is basically them joining the conga line. This is like that scene from Beetlejuice. It's inevitable that everybody would follow suit. It can't be helped. The music will drive them. They will be joining into this conga line of prioritizing privacy. So, let's talk about those iOS updates. Apple launched what it's calling the app tracking transparency, or ATT with its iOS 14.5 update that happened in April 2021. The basics of this is that this update will ask its users to consent to having their browsing habits and personal information tracked and they are given the right and ability to opt out.

[00:09:34.720] - Lanie
Now, essentially, it's just giving people agency as to how their online behaviors are being tracked.

[00:09:39.550] - Lanie
So, what does the iOS 14.5 update mean for you and your conversion rates?

[00:09:44.710] - Lanie
Well, it means your ability to target people based on browsing behaviors and personal information is and will continue to be impacted. And then there's the iOS 15 update that happened in September 2021. And this is giving people agency over how their email behaviors are being tracked by limiting the use of invisible pixels within their inbox.

[00:10:07.450] - Lanie
So, what does the iOS 15 update mean for you and your conversion rates?

[00:10:11.650] - Lanie
Well, it means your ability to track things like open rates from your email marketing campaigns is and will continue to be impacted. So, your performance isn't necessarily lagging because of the iOS updates. It's your ability to continue relying on these pixels that have been tracking your performance that is lagging. So, yes, your conversion rates look like they're hurting right now. That totally isn't just happening in your head or just a new thing. However, these changes are all happening as a result of protecting your human rights. While you, my humble and honest marketer, may feel annoyed at how it's impacting your ability to continue marketing the way you always have been.

[00:10:49.980] - Lanie
The change is necessary because there have been liberties taken far beyond reason or your consent as to how every detail about you is being collected, used, shared, disclosed, stored, and monetized. Keep in mind, this whole digital world is relatively new. And just as you test the marketing strategy by doing it and collecting some information and then making decisions about how you want to move forward and make it better. It's kind of the same deal with online business right now. We did things one way for a while.

[00:11:19.380] - Lanie
We saw room for improvement and these changes you're seeing from Google, from Apple, from your browsers, from your governments. These are all kind of a collective agreement as to what changes we need to make in the online marketing world to make it a safer and better place for all participants. So, let's get to the most important part of any of these conversations.

[00:11:40.050] - Lanie
What do these Privacy changes mean for you?

[00:11:43.950] - Lanie
Well, it means that if your motive for collecting information has been as a means of exploiting the people whose information you've been collecting, it's going to get bumpy for you. However, if your purpose for data collection has been to guide you towards making smarter business decisions, I'm happy to share that the ethical law abiding marketers will be just fine in all of this. Because there are ways you can continue to see how you're performing that is ethical and law abiding. Now you will have to change some things because as we've established, the way things have been done, it's flawed.

[00:12:17.510] - Lanie
But we're at that.

[00:12:18.820] - Lanie
When you know better.

[00:12:19.630] - Lanie
You do better phase of online marketing. And so let's talk about how we can do better, because as Gardener, the leader in tech research and consulting, they're saying that 65% of the world's population will be protected under privacy regulation by 2023. This is a huge shift from just last year in 2020, when only 10% of people had their rights to privacy protected online. Even without the legislation to protect them, people are becoming increasingly savvy with the way their data is being used and shared by employing things like privacy safe and compliant browsers like Brave and DuckDuckGo or by using Ada and cookie blocker tools.

[00:13:02.490] - Lanie
So, while tracking online never really was a perfect science, it's inevitably going to get a lot less reliable with all of these updates and changes to how we're tracking data online in order to be privacy compliant. So, if you were buying ads, if you're sending emails, if you want to know what people are doing on your website.

[00:13:22.190] - Lanie
You will have to learn to be data compliant.

[00:13:25.500] - Lanie
There is no way around this. We have to go through this. And the so called good old days of slapping a few pixels up on your website to collect as much information as that Pixel can or wants to. Those days are over, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, for ethical responsible marketers who are and want to be intentional, this is an especially good thing. We are all being forced into showing up as human beings. Yes, even online who treat others with respect as opposed to treating them like a hit.

[00:13:53.840] - Lanie
And we went over the difference between first party cookies and third party cookies and how some browsers, including Google, are rendering third party cookies obsolete. If you've noticed, your Facebook analytics has changed both in its format and the reliability of its numbers. This is the reason why your Facebook Pixel default settings are to use both first party cookies and third party cookies. What's the difference? Well, when you're creating Facebook ads and you target someone's interests or whether they've interacted with your Facebook page, these are your first party cookies in action because everything is tracked and happening on the same site.

[00:14:29.780] - Lanie
However, when you're using ads to retarget someone who visits your sales page on a totally different domain two weeks ago, those are your third party cookies in action because this is a domain other than the one that that person is currently visiting.

[00:14:44.310] - Lanie
This means you are going to have to start meeting people where they are rather than trying to lure them from where they are.

[00:14:51.550] - Lanie
That's why you're going to see an increase in the use of opt in forms on Facebook platform for building your email list rather than redirecting them to your own site. Same deal with sales pages. Why? Because you won't be able to use third party cookies to retarget someone who visits another site than yours, but you will be able to target someone using first party cookies. So if someone visit a sales page or an option you have on Facebook's platform, you can then retarget them with Facebook ads as well.

[00:15:19.920] - Lanie
Since it's going to become increasingly important to meet people where they are, expect a more diverse means of communication, marketing, and reporting to emerge.

[00:15:29.730] - Lanie
I'm making predictions today, and my first prediction is that we will see a surge in new and creative ways that will allow us as marketers to communicate with people in a sort of multiplatform approach. As the depreciation of cookies increases, the availability of services like text messaging, messenger, chats, and website intercoms will be the tip of an ever growing iceberg people seem to be referring to as multi channel communications. Another trend you can expect to see emerge is multi-stack marketing. The same way you have multiple social media channels where you post similar content, but in ways that are customized to how that platform works, you're going to be doing the same sort of thing across your marketing channels. Because platforms like Facebook and Google and Amazon will be capturing, collecting, and owning the first party data. You'll likely be creating entire funnels to live within those systems rather than funneling that traffic over to your site as you currently do.

[00:16:27.430] - Lanie
And finally, because our marketing campaigns will look more like mind maps than they do now, where everything centers around driving traffic to our central site, expect the emergence of multichannel reporting to be a thing. We will no longer be able to rely or even lean on one source to tell us the truth about our online performance, because the data will no longer be allowed to be shared across multiple platforms and channels. Now, before you turn me off, I know this sounds intimidating, but think of this the same way you think of your social media accounts unless it's a team effort.

[00:17:00.430] - Lanie
Nobody is on all the platforms. Most small online businesses manage best with a focus on one or two platforms. Right? And your marketing is going to be a similar approach. You'll simply have little ecosystems living within each platform on which you have chosen to focus marketing yourself. Another prediction I'm going to make, and I've already kind of hinted at this with the multichannel communications, but engagement is going to be more important and valued than ever. Expect more direct marketing efforts and collaborations, they're going to increase significantly because as these changes take place and people have to adjust their ad campaigns accordingly.

[00:17:37.110] - Lanie
For many, it's going to be a better return on investment to run campaigns like joint venture Webinars, where people can gain access to each other's audiences than it will be to run ads to your webinars. Now, even collaborations will be faced with challenges because you can expect affiliate links to be impacted as well because they rely on cookies that have a certain duration of tracking attributed to them. Now, while this won't be the most elegant solution if the cookies are problematic for you currently, you may find coupon codes to be an effective control for being able to accurately track those referrals.

[00:18:09.240] - Lanie
However, I'm excited to see what affiliate marketing software platforms work out as a solution to this. And I'd encourage you to inquire with your provider to see what they're saying about affiliate tracking post iOS updates. Now, as people opt out of being tracked, I foresee a return to the password protected content where you have to log into a website, thereby consenting to having your activity onset website to be tracked as a means of gaining more insight as to how people are behaving online on your site.

[00:18:39.250] - Lanie
These were popular a few years ago, but I think they may introduce an effective tool in providing something your audience wants from you while you're obtaining the consent that you want from them. Now, as for email marketing, it's very likely that the iOS 15 updates specifically will turn the term open rates into an adorable concept. We will get nostalgic. Do you remember when? Vibes about in Urban Outfitter will probably sell it back to us in 15 years? However, even if all the pixels and cookies get removed, you are still able to track your email marketing performance using UTM parameters.

[00:19:13.270] - Lanie
You can still get a feel for things like your click through rates or CTR. So if you haven't been using UTMs or you don't know what they are, head over to omgrowth.com O-M-G-R-O-W-T-H and find out everything you need to know about getting intentional with tracking your emails, your ads, your social media performance just for starters. But another element of email marketing that is going to be impacted is how you clean your list. It's known to be a good practice to clean out your email list of people who are not opening your emails, because when you send emails that aren't being open, this can impact your deliverability as well as the cost you're paying for your email marketing provider for subscribers who aren't even seeing or opening your emails.

[00:19:53.050] - Lanie
So, in the past, what you would do is you would send out an email to everyone on your list who hasn't opened an email in the last six months asking if they still want to receive emails from you. And if it's still crickets, you delete their contact information. But you're not going to be able to track open rates anymore. So, how are we going to do this moving forward? I suspect that engagement metrics like clicks will continue to be available, and so the shift will have to be from did they open the email to did they engage with by email?

[00:20:20.320] - Lanie
And I hope at this point, you're starting to see the trend here because yes, engagement is the new benchmark against which you will measure everything. The days of being concerned over lowest bar metrics like page views and open rates. Those days are over. You're going to have to embrace these weird concepts called people and engagement and consent. And you know what I bet you'll be just fine with that. In fact, I think you'll do better than most with that. Now we covered a lot here, so let's recap some new and remixed ways to shift the way you're currently marketing yourself.

[00:20:51.800] - Lanie
One, if you're buying ads, look into integrating freebie, opt ins and sales directly through the platform you're using to run those ads. If it's possible for you to build those sales funnels into Facebook's own domain, it will be easier and more accurate for Facebook to retarget the user's behavior. It can actually collect data on two, put some thought into meeting people where they are, and consider adding in communication channels that would best meet them there like chat bots or website intercoms. Three, anything you or your team are hitting publish on can and should be tracked with UTM parameters, and this will be the most effective way of seeing a return on investment on anything you are putting out there.

[00:21:35.290] - Lanie
The pay and spray approach to marketing will soon be ineffective. The reason for which it will be made ineffective is actually beneficial to marketers who already rely more on relationship and engagement based marketing. Does this mean we will have to put a little more effort forth to measure its effectiveness? Well, yes, it will. However, we are in an industry of ever changing strategies and tactics, and this happens to be one that not only benefits our businesses in the long term, but also force us all to think and act a little more humanely.

[00:22:07.530] - Lanie
So, we've covered the changes you're going to have to make to your tracking if you want to keep that data compliant with privacy. But what about your strategies? If you want your online business to be relevant two years from now, you are going to have to make like Zuckerberg and make some changes. You may have noticed that old Zuck has changed the business name and model of the Facebook Empire to Meta. I would bet that you have probably been far more Privacy compliant than old Zuck.

[00:22:35.840] - Lanie
And so, you'll probably be just fine with making just a few adjustments to your business rather than having to overhaul your entire business model the way he is. But I will provide you with a few strategies you can and should implement as soon as possible. And let's begin with the lowest bar of them all, your Privacy policy. You do not have one. Get one. If you do have one, read through it to make sure it's up to date and make sure you have it on your website and its assets like your sales pages.

[00:23:03.190] - Lanie
You need a Privacy policy. You need a Privacy policy. You need a Privacy policy.

[00:23:09.230] - Lanie
Now, I'm not a legal professional and I'm not going to give you legal advice on this matter, but I'm happy to point you towards some affordable professionals who can. But as an online business owner, you have a legal obligation to inform your visitors what information you are collecting, using, storing and sharing. So if you're saying Lady.

[00:23:26.770] - Lanie
I don't share personal information, you are.

[00:23:29.890] - Lanie
If you have anything like a Facebook Pixel on your site, because that Pixel is essentially allowing Facebook to collect, use, and store what is happening on the site you've installed it on it's, collecting that information on your behalf. You are sharing that information with Facebook. Now, are there any exceptions to this rule of needing a Privacy policy? The answer is absolutely not. You need a Privacy policy. End of story. Now, the same deal goes for your opt ins. Don't act like a gross gropy frat boy stereotype in about 80s movie fondling

[00:24:03.900] - Lanie
anyone checking you out, get consent to people opting into your email list. Even if you don't live in the European Union, getting GDPR compliant is a smooth move that will most likely make you data compliant once Privacy laws are being enforced on you, which as we've discussed, is pretty much inevitable. Now, if you're not sure if you're being GDPR compliant, I'm certain totally positive that your email marketing provider has documentation available on this for you. So go ahead and inquire with them. Check that out, search their knowledge base, ask their help desk, whatever.

[00:24:37.600] - Lanie
Just type in GDPR and see what comes up and see if you're being GDPR compliant. Now, if you're using Google Analytics, and that's a very good idea. By the way, another must have is the new version of Google Analytics. It's called GA4. If you've been online for a minute, you probably have the version called Universal Analytics installed on your website and it's assets. But at this point you want to have both versions of Google Analytics installed on your website and your assets like your sales pages.

[00:25:05.290] - Lanie
Why? Because these are two totally different data models, which is basically a fancy way of saying they're not even measuring the same thing, and you're not going to be able to transfer the data from one version to the other. So, all your past website visitor information is just no longer going to be accessible from one version to another. Now, the difference between Universal Analytics and GA4 is kind of like the equivalent of planning a road trip where one person is counting the distance in hours and the other person is counting in miles or kilometers.

[00:25:36.220] - Lanie
It's similar, but you're talking about and measuring two totally different sets of information. And while one may correlate to the other doesn't necessarily. Now another difference is that Universal Analytics is like the old way of doing things. You remember that Nokia phone you had? Yeah, it's about as old as that, and it focused on hits and page views. Like, if you remember those pages counters from back in the days of the GeoCities websites and stuff like that, the metrics that Universal Analytics collects is basically as outdated as that, because that's when it came out.

[00:26:07.120] - Lanie
But now we're moving more towards those engagement focus metrics that we were talking about last week. Things like clicks and events. Those are the priorities. Now, the Google powers that Be are still working on GA4. There's a lot of improvements and features being worked on at this point, and most analysts are actually still using the universal version for reporting. But the benefit of installing GA4 on your website now is that when it is ready for its close up, you will have all kinds of retroactive data collected because you had the sense to install it on your website early.

[00:26:38.110] - Lanie
So, all that past website visitor information that you're going to lose when Universal Analytics is no longer active isn't going to be a total wash for you if you have GA4 on your site. Now, I mentioned those old school page view counters we used to slap onto our website to essentially provide new visitors with social proof that, hey, our stuff is worth seeing. Those vanity numbers used to matter like a lot, but everyone and everything is moving away from attributing value to those types of numbers.

[00:27:05.570] - Lanie
I mean, even social media platforms like Instagram, arguably the pinnacle of fronting social proof. They don't even show the number of likes anymore.

[00:27:13.560] - Lanie
Using your numbers to identify trends is way more meaningful than the actual value of the numbers.

[00:27:20.020] - Lanie
Your online performance is not like your account or your bookkeeper, the accuracy and the specifics. They don't really matter nearly as much as gearing that information towards increasing engagement and decision making, seeing those trends. I mean, we kind of do still have a version of those old school page view counters, right? You've seen them where you go to a sales page. And there's this modest little pop up in the bottom saying.

[00:27:42.480] - Lanie
Sally from Syracuse just signed up for this thing.

[00:27:45.110] - Lanie
And a second later.

[00:27:46.330] - Lanie
It's Mona from Milwaukee just signed up for this thing.

[00:27:49.100] - Lanie
Social proof is totally still a thing. It's just no longer built through likes and hits.

[00:27:53.980] - Lanie
Your social clout now gets built through creating connections between yourself and other people.

[00:27:59.620] - Lanie
If you've been playing your online business as a numbers game, consider asking yourself how you can humanize the experience you're offering to those said numbers. Because your relevancy in the near future is certainly going to depend on it, which brings us to how you're targeting people. And yes, even though we tend to use less flattering words like users or conversions or leads, it remains that what we are talking about here are people and those who start acting and interacting with their audience like they are people will reap a bigger slice of the pie.

[00:28:33.040] - Lanie
So, expect to see on site retargeting to become a bigger deal. You can use services like opt in Monster to track your on site behaviors, and this uses first party cookies, so totally legit, and you can target and engage your visitors based on how they are engaging with your website. So say someone is looking at your thanksgiving decorations, post or video. You could target someone who is 30 seconds into that engaged activity with a pop up that says, hey, since you're digging this, maybe you want to join us for our holiday dinner prep workshop next week.

[00:29:03.240] - Lanie
You can apply similar strategies with onsite, bots and intercoms. And yes, of course, everybody knows these are automated tools, but when they're used efficiently and intentionally, they can be used to build that clairvoyance.

[00:29:14.810] - Lanie
I know what you're going to need and like next feeling.

[00:29:17.700] - Lanie
And in the meantime, the sun is setting on the days of the pay and spray tactics of generic mass advertising. So, look, I've spent most of the last ten minutes just validating the importance of making these shifts. And I've gone on and on about it, but it's actually just a few boxes for you to check off, so let's summarize and frame it as such. Shall we? One put a Privacy policy in place or update the one you have. I've included links to legal professionals. I recommend who can help you with this at an affordable rate, but it is your legal obligation as an online business owner to have this in place and you are a liability and in violation of an ever increasing number of international data compliance laws.

[00:29:56.410] - Lanie
If you do not have a Privacy policy in place and up to date. Two, make sure your GDPR compliant with the way you are collecting email addresses. This is as simple as inquiring with your email marketing provider to ask them how you can do this using their specific system, so it doesn't have to be any guesswork involved here as to how you're going to set that up. Again. There are an ever increasing number of international data compliance laws being implemented every single week. But GDPR was sort of the first big gun out there, and it's robust enough that if you're complying to it, you're probably going to be in line with anything else being put out there.

[00:30:30.430] - Lanie
Three, add GA4 tracking to your site and its assets as soon as possible. But keep that Google Analytics Universal Analytics version on your website in the meantime. I have some videos guiding you through how to do this and verify this over at omgrowth.com. But this is kind of like how people said they wish they had invested in Apple in the 80s or in Bitcoin when it was a dollar. GA4 is the future of every data driven decision you'll soon be making. So, save yourself up for that success.

[00:30:59.460] - Lanie
Now, Four, focus on and value trends over numbers, because when it comes to analyzing your online performance, the numbers themselves carry way less weight than what the numbers are telling you about your online performance. If you haven't already, let this be a reminder that vanity metrics are anywhere near as valuable as growth and engagement metrics. And finally, five, remember whose needs come first, and the answer is not you.

[00:31:27.970] - Lanie
Yes.

[00:31:28.370] - Lanie
You want people to revisit your sales page. You want people to sign up for your email list. You want people to look at and share your content, but it's up to you to personalize their experience and give them a reason and connection to your brand. Now, I know change means more work for you in the present tense. But frankly, we as human beings. We need this work. You deserve to be protected and treated like a human being, even online. And that's what all of these changes are about.

[00:31:56.620] - Lanie
Consent is never an ugly word.

[00:31:59.230] - Lanie
I encourage you to reframe these changes as an opportunity, your opportunity to be a champion for human rights, consent, and behaving ethically in the online business world. And if there's anything I can do to support you, leave a comment on an Instagram post or slip into my DMs @ohmygrowth. Because while I like to say I've always got you, I've got you extra hard on this one. And if you're picking up what I'm throwing down in this talk, I talk a lot more about these sorts of things and giving you a whole lot more stuff to pick up.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.370] - Liz
Hey, everybody, and welcome. My name is Liz Theresa, and I am here to teach you guys all about how you can use copy to increase your conversions. Because let's face it, money comes from your message. And if you're watching this presentation, you have a blog or you have a business and who wouldn't want that to be more profitable? That's what we're here to do.

[00:00:35.940] - Liz
So, a little bit more about me personally, I'm the host of Liz on Biz. So, if you've listened to my show, it's delivered fresh every single Monday, 30 minutes of inspirational and funny content about business stuff and marketing and all that. I've been in business ten years this year building websites and brands for people. I'm a professional branding and business coach, and I'm a Mama, and that's my peanut named Leo. And yeah, and I'm from the Boston area.

[00:01:04.490] - Liz
Just so you guys get a little bit of context for where I'm coming from. So, here's what we're going to be talking about today and throughout content. I try to keep things light and cheaper, because sometimes when we talk about messaging, it's sort of like your brain will feel like it weighs £100. So, you'll notice fun gifts and little animations. I'll just try to keep it super light for you, because when I say, what's your message, you're probably thinking.

[00:01:30.910] - Liz
I don't know. That's a really normal reaction. So, please be gentle with yourself as they take you through some of this content. And if you've already learned a lot about messaging. So, if you're like a veteran of this stuff, what I would suggest to you is just try to keep an open mind because you might learn something new because I think that the way I teach it is a little bit different than what you might be used to, which is ideal.

[00:01:53.520] - Liz
Right? Because then I'm different and that's good. So, I'm going to start by talking about what's copy, message and conversions, which are like the kind of the key points in this presentation, and then we're going to work on your message together. Okay. Let's go.

[00:02:07.830] - Liz
So, what is copy really, right? So, copy is any words, messaging or content you use with relation to your brand. And by the way, you guys all have brands, even if you've never described your blog or your website as a brand or your business as a brand, you're a brand. Personally, you're a brand. We're all brands, whether or not we choose to like accept it.

[00:02:31.310] - Liz
So, once you start to accept it, you can be more strategic with your brand, right? Because copy and messaging and content, these are things that we can tweak and use as a tool to get people to take the actions we want. And you can see I get a little silly. There's any content you use and emails autologue with a dog, with a hem, just to keep you.

[00:02:58.400] - Liz
So, I want to keep on your toes, guys. Okay. Copy is the basis of your marketing and you're like, okay, Liz, you say that probably because you sell copy, and I'm like, yeah, that's true. But like, look at this.

[00:03:11.500] - Liz
Look at this. This is irrefutable scientific evidence that it really does scientific evidence. You guys are probably like, she's crazy. But listen, copy is the central thing when it comes to your website, Facebook Ads sales page. Copy.

[00:03:26.550] - Liz
Everything hinges on copy. And what you might have noticed in your work thus far is that for blogs and blogging, that couldn't be more true. So, when I'm going to be talking about messaging, this is a different type of copy that maybe you're used to writing, but it's probably the most important when it comes to thinking of using your blog and your website as a lead converter and as something that you want to use to funnel people to like buy something later or even just to grow your readership.

[00:03:57.030] - Liz
Depending on what your goal is, copy is going to be this powerful thing you can use.

[00:04:02.390] - Liz
So, it's at your disposal. And I always like to say, yes, even you can use copy because everybody has this inner voice. It's like, but not me. Like I'm just me over here that sounds hard or like, I should just hire a professional copywriter and you can. Professional copywriters are cool rad people, and they're great if you end up slamming your head against the wall too much about this.

[00:04:28.740] - Liz
The goal of this presentation is to make this something that you can do yourself. So, we talked about copy. Here's what I'm talking about when I say conversions. Okay. So, when we're talking about using copy to increase conversion, when people say conversion, they mean that you convert that word a higher percentage of users from your website than you would otherwise. So, when you think of your website, it's getting a ton of traffic.

[00:04:57.050] - Liz
And if you even think of the highway, right, that's all users on the internet, if you can think of it like a highway, and maybe your exit number 15. Okay, that's your website as exit 15. And you want people to come to that exit, right. And you want to capture all that traffic and retain it. There are ways to do that.

[00:05:17.060] - Liz
And the way that you do it online is with your language. It's with words. Okay. I guess if it were a real exit sign, you can make yours purple and have glowing lights and say that there's free tacos. And that might work.

[00:05:29.830] - Liz
But for the purposes of your blog, then you use words. Words are at your disposal to increase conversions, because even as a blog, you're going to be traffic is a wicked big deal. And what's really frustrating, and this is a person that's been doing this for ten years is that I think when I say you guys are so concerned about traffic, you guys look for ways to increase traffic, but you don't focus on retention. And that's your problem because it's easy to just throw money at SEO and Google ads and Pinterest ads or wherever you're throwing your money and you will see an uptick in traffic.

[00:06:07.370] - Liz
But if they're not subscribing opting in or engaging with you or following you everywhere, then you're really just wasting it.

[00:06:15.660] - Liz
Because who cares? Like, if they're coming once. You want to create people that are coming to you all the time, you want loyal readers that become like unofficial brand ambassadors. That's totally the goal. Okay. So, conversions matter kind of no matter where you're coming from.

[00:06:33.750] - Liz
And if you focus on your messaging and your copy, then you can spend money on the SEO and all that other stuff. Because by improving your copy on your website, that's going to let readers and users know how you fit into their world. Because if somebody comes to your website, gets a recipe and leaves, they might not know why they should say for more recipes. Or maybe why your website is better for that type of content than delicious or something. So, like I want you to think a little bit about that.

[00:07:03.890] - Liz
Like, why are you better? And that's going to come up when we talk about messaging, but how to make that extremely amplified? There's no mistake for how you fit into somebody's world because that's sort of what people are like, is this worth my time? Is this worth my time is a reframe that goes through somebody's mind when they're a user. That's like going through content on website after website.

[00:07:23.960] - Liz
Okay. And so, then when your website is better and optimized for converting people, like I said, your marketing dollars get you more readers and customers. So, rather than spending $10 on a Google ad to get 30 people that won't come back, you could spend $10 on a Google ad to get 30 people that do come back. Does that make sense? Alright.

[00:07:43.060] - Liz
So, once you accept, now you're like, okay, Liz, I'm starting to believe you. This is what you're thinking. You're like, I'm starting to believe you might be onto something. Okay. And I'm like, yeah, why do you think I'm here?

[00:07:56.310] - Liz
I would say here's what I mean about messaging. So, we talked about how copies all the words and all the content that shows up in your business. Like, you remember that chart where I was like, there's scientific. This is scientific proof. Big bang theory proof, right?

[00:08:11.510] - Liz
That copies wicked important. Well, there's different types of copy. There's a copy that you guys are probably more used to, like, social media posts and newsletters and blog articles. Right. And then there is your messaging.

[00:08:25.360] - Liz
And your messaging is definitely the thing on which everything hinges. And if you think about your brand like a house, your messaging is definitely the concrete foundation that is holding everything up. The really strong and sturdy stuff. And your messaging has four parts. Okay.

[00:08:42.570] - Liz
And it's who you help. What you help people do. The problem you solve and how you solve it, and why you do it. And so maybe you're like, well, is that five or that's six? And you just made it look like four. And I'd be like, maybe.

[00:08:58.090] - Liz
But let's look at it like, it's four things because it may feel a little bit easier. And when the message is the thing that's really strong client attraction or readership or whatever your goal is, that is going to work so much better. Okay. So, when I say, who is your target audience? I am talking about your ideal reader. Who is the world?

[00:09:22.570] - Liz
What kind of person's life do you want to change like when you think about raising the stakes on what you're doing here? And it's sort of like going from talking about your website, like being like, oh, yeah, I have a website. No, I have a brand. I have a company I'm running. Like I want you to start using grown up language when talking about yourself, because that will raise the stakes and remind you why the work is so important.

[00:09:47.380] - Liz
Okay. So, messaging is really about digging deep and just scratching the surface to get clear on, like, why is this work so important? Which is why the why, you see the why at the bottom. But sometimes it's actually easier to start the why? Because you're like, okay, well, why did I start this?

[00:10:05.840] - Liz
What difference do I want to make in the world? And when you start saying, what difference do you want to make that can also help you get clear on the who right. So, you might be like, well, I started this because I was really tired of dieting, and I wanted to produce body positive content that made me feel less alone in my own skin. Okay. And then you're like, well, then who do you help?

[00:10:25.580] - Liz
People that are looking into body positive content, people that are body positive activists, people that are interested in that kind of stuff. So, like then you can see how you can work backwards. And then the problem that you solve in the case of body confidence, it would be I solve the problem of like society hating fat people or, like, you know body dysmorphia and you know like help people with disordered eating feel less alone. How do you solve it through the content? The empowering content through interviews, through my podcast, through my blog.

[00:11:02.290] - Liz
Some of you guys might have courses through courses. So, you could kind of, that's what you sell, right. So, what you sell, even if you don't sell anything you're serving. So, you're giving content. So that's definitely the how you solve it.

[00:11:15.360] - Liz
So, that's just an example of messaging. I told you, I'd make you feel alive with the funny gifs, guys. This is really me. That's me with brunette hair, though. But what I'm getting at is that your messaging, right?

[00:11:31.200] - Liz
You've probably heard of brand message statements. So, this is also sometimes called a mission statement, even though that's technically a little bit different although if it helps you to think of it that way, go with it. Your elevator pitch.

[00:11:43.850] - Liz
That's the horrible thing where you stand in a room and you have to introduce yourself. And you're like, Hi, give me money. But you have to explain why you're important. And then the brand message statement, which is my personal favorite, because I think it most clearly says what we're talking about. So, when I say your messaging has four parts, those four parts can be molded into a few sentences, which is the brand message statement. Okay.

[00:12:06.270] - Liz
So that brand message statement, I'm going to give you guys a template. So, if you're like, oh, my God, Liz, that slides over, you can rewind, but stay with me because I'm going to show you what we're talking about here. But this should be communicated everywhere you are. So, like, no matter whether you're on Facebook or like, your website or like, your bio and you guest blog somewhere else, I want it to be really really clear how you and your brand or website solve the problem and who you help and how you solve it.

[00:12:38.370] - Liz
So, then when people come across who you are, they can make a really quick judgment call about how you fit into their world. And if you do right. Sometimes people, when I talk about the who you help, the target audience stuff, people get really choked up and they're like, oh, you're going to make me niche down. And I don't want to. And I'd be like, you do you.

[00:13:00.860] - Liz
But you have to start somewhere and you don't want to serve your content to people that aren't truly interested. That's the other thing, right. So like,  and when you start to niche and you start to become really clear who you'd love to help, they will show up. They show up more. And in fact, people that fall outside your niche will like that.

[00:13:19.620] - Liz
You're wicked clear. And people that fall outside your niche that are still meant to read your content and absorb it. They'll still be there, too. That's what people think, like, they're closing doors. No, like you're just being better at your job.

[00:13:32.020] - Liz
And when you remember the why stuff, like the why is not in this template, because the Y is sometimes goes on for pages. When you really think about why, you do this, right. But when you think about your why, it becomes why more important to be clearing your messaging, because when you're clearing your messaging, everything else works. So, let's write yours, right? And then I'm not a copywriter.

[00:13:54.400] - Liz
Oh, my God. I'd be like, no, remember how I said that doesn't matter. But you know what, this one. I almost got rid of it because I did this earlier, but it's still so funny.

[00:14:02.950] - Liz
I just had to keep it. So, if you go back, I know you guys are getting dizzy. If we go back here, we're going to do, like, each one of these things, these four parts. That's what's going to make up the next few slides.

[00:14:14.770] - Liz
So, I'm going to be breaking this down really with you. So we're starting with who you help? The target demographic, target audience, ideal client, customer avatars. These are so many words, ideal reader. What makes them happy, what makes them tick?

[00:14:28.050] - Liz
What drives them crazy, what's their daily life like. And the reason why I asked this is and I'm just going to say, because we talked about body conference. Let's switch gears for examples. Right. And we'll talk about mom blogs because there are so many mom blogs and not in a bad way.

[00:14:43.130] - Liz
I think we need them. We need you mom bloggers, please stay. But when you think about blogging for a mom or creating content for a mom, it's going to be different than how you create content for other types of ideal readers. Why? Because oh, my god, I'm so tired.

[00:15:00.010] - Liz
That's one thing. I'm tired all the time. I never read long form posts. I have a toddler. So, you guys might be writing for me.

[00:15:06.920] - Liz
I never read long social media posts. I have friends that write them, and I click like, anyway, but I don't read them because I just don't have time for it. And then you're like, well, then moms must like videos. And then yes. But there's a however, right.

[00:15:21.780] - Liz
The however, is that even though I like video content, pardon me, if you do hear my baby, he is a little loud here, but I don't know if it will come through in the audio. But yeah, we like videos, but sometimes we have to watch them on mute, because if our son hears us watching a video, he'll want to watch his favorite cartoon on our phone. Right. So, then you need captions on the video. So like, these are things to think about. A lot of people watch things on mute.

[00:15:46.820] - Liz
This is the thing that people miss. For example, I shopped it with this boutique, and I can't wait until they do close captioning because I just can't listen. Sometimes they'll be like, use coupon code to save money or something. And it's a live sale. And you can actually have live captioning.

[00:16:05.090] - Liz
Now, I don't know if you guys know that, but Zoom has live captioning. It just came out. So, I want you to think about your ideal reader, right. So, if it is somebody like me, are you engineering your content appropriately for them? Somebody who does a really great job at kind of diversifying presentation of content is Business insider.

[00:16:27.080] - Liz
And I know that's not like a blog. It's like a newspaper kind of thing online news magazine. However, what I love about it is that at the beginning of every article, they give bullet points. So, then for people that have no time, they have a way of absorbing the content without having to give up too much of their day. Right.

[00:16:45.160] - Liz
So like, that's my personal example. So think about your ideal reader. What are they like, and how do you think that they would like to avoid what you have to offer? And also how can you diversify the mediums through which you actually deliver the content? So, now we're getting into the problem that you solve and what you help people do.

[00:17:02.460] - Liz
And you're like, you know I'm just a blog. I don't solve problems. And then you have this weird voice, I guess, because that's how I just impersonated you. But if you're not sure, like I've said before, not knowing this stuff is really normal. It's weirder to be me telling you how to do things.

[00:17:18.300] - Liz
So, like accept that I'm the weird one. And then once you accept it, I have this little prompt that might be really fun for you. It's called the I totally get you exercise. And so, sometimes I also call it the Edgies. So if you guys have watched anything else that I've done talks at or whatever, I also call this the Edgies.

[00:17:37.130] - Liz
But the Edgies are all about getting into the brain of your person. So like, we did talk about the who you help. Now we're talking about the problem that you solve. But the Edgy process and the Edgy exercise gets you clear on the person, and it gets you clear on the problem that you solve because it takes you from being like, well, I'm just a website about cars to being like, oh, I'm a website that teaches women how to maintain their own automobile. Oh, my God.

[00:18:04.140] - Liz
There's this wicked funny lady. What if she's watching now? She's probably not. But listen, no, she's a video blogger, and she's called like, well, clearly she should hire me because I don't remember what she's called. But I think she's called, like, the car reviewing mom or something, and all she does is review minivans, and she'll go to dealerships and take videos going through minivans. Being like, this one has a video in the backseat.

[00:18:29.370] - Liz
This one has two screens. This one does this, this one like, whatever. Right? She's a hoot. Anyway.

[00:18:37.560] - Liz
So, now you're going to go Google it, but she's really clear on the problem that she solves because talk about uncomfortable to be a woman going to a dealership. But like, by creating the content that she's creating, she's giving women information and information is power. And then women can go buy cars and feel equipped without having to bring in their mean aunt or, like, angry husband or whatever. Whoever you bring to the dealership with you. Everybody has that person and their family, right?

[00:19:04.600] - Liz
That helps them buy cars angry. And those people are very valuable people. So, think about the problem that you solve So, then that woman went from being a person that just does videos about cars. And now she's a woman that creates content specifically for women to help them feel more empowered when shopping for a car.

[00:19:19.860] - Liz
I know, right? Did I sell her so good to you guys? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I did. So, this is a little FYI for you. 

[00:19:28.070] - Liz
So, sometimes when we do the edgy exercise, which is like, I totally get that you get wicked afraid when you want to go buy a car, because it's really scary because everybody that works there is a shark, and they all are sweaty and angry and stuff. So, like, that's the example of the actual get used that we were just talking about. But when you do the actual get used, sometimes you're like, oh, my god. All I'm writing about our problems, and no one wants to hear problems because we have pandemics and social justice issues and student loan debt.

[00:19:58.130] - Liz
And I'd be like, look, take a breath and you'd go, oh, god, I really needed that breath.

[00:20:03.440] - Liz
But you will you'll take a breath and you'll realize that talking about problems doesn't make you Bumtown USA and just to not offend anyone, I put Bumtown USA in the Boston area because that's where I'm from. And I feel like if I picked another part of the country, somebody would be mad. So, now it's just anybody that lives here will be mad because obviously, I don't think that there's really a Bumtown USA, although somebody that could be watching this from Bumtown USA could be like, you spelled my town that I'd be like, oh, my God, I'm so excited to meet you.

[00:20:33.310] - Liz
But, yeah, listen, when we talk about the edgies, we're talking about our customer and reader problems, that's huge. And here are some reasons why pain shows empathy.

[00:20:45.390] - Liz
Right. So, then, oh, my god, the person feels understood. I never feel understood. My whole life has been a misunderstanding. Right?

[00:20:53.630] - Liz
But like when a website understands me, I'm like, oh, my god. Here's my routing and checking account number. How can you suck me drive for money? And I know that's an exaggeration. But people open their hearts and their wallets at the same time if they feel understood.

[00:21:08.530] - Liz
Okay. So, pain shows empathy and understanding. And pain also raises the stakes. So, like, it takes that woman from being a woman that makes videos about cars and showing their features to being a woman, that makes you feel equipped and confident when you go to a dealership. And when you talk about how feeling equipped and confident is how scary it is to go to a dealership and buy a car by yourself. Then you're like, oh, my god, that is a way more important video blog now because you reminded me why it's important or I'm looking for.

[00:21:44.410] - Liz
Okay, like, let's say you're a lifestyle blogger because I think a lot of lifestyle bloggers miss out on the messaging stuff because they're like, Well, let me just look like an influencer and everything will come together. But I feel like one thing that I wish, the edge that's going to make somebody an influencer from a lifestyle blogger is that it's not when you're talking about the beauty products it's when you're talking about how those products make people feel. Right? So, it's not about contouring. It's about the before and then the after.

[00:22:14.820] - Liz
It's about talking to somebody that's always wanted to feel wicked pretty.

[00:22:18.340] - Liz
And maybe like, if they read your blog and do the things that you're showing them how to do, that's what it's really about. It's transforming the way somebody views themselves, self esteem, all that stuff. So, then you're like, oh, my god, I'm not just a beauty blogger. I'm changing people's lives. And then before you guys are laughing because you're like, Liz, that's really dramatic.

[00:22:38.180] - Liz
Well, one. Yeah, I was a theater major. It's going to be dramatic. But likealso two, if it's not dramatically important, then why are we doing this? Why?

[00:22:49.750] - Liz
Okay. How do you solve the problem? So, this doesn't require much thought. What does your website actually do for people, say what it is you exist to do what's the number one thing people get from you? So, like, this is just because sometimes when you go to a website and you'll be like, this is a blog about everything.

[00:23:06.150] - Liz
This is making sure that in your brand message statement, you're really really specific about what you're actually there to help people do. And so this will be like, I'm a beauty blog. So, then people don't get confused and think you're writing about Manila bonnet or shoes or, like, Blazers. Right. And then the why so, the why has kind of permeated everything that we're talking about.

[00:23:28.720] - Liz
Right. So, this can be dual. I started my business because I had a bad boss. Now it's been so long that this doesn't even resonate with why I started my business anywhere. But it's true.

[00:23:40.390] - Liz
But then when you really think about it, it's because I wanted others to have the fame they crave to show up as themselves boldly and confidently and to be a star. And actually looking back, talk about the worst feeling in the world is when you audition for a play and then you get like, you're in the chorus and you're like, this sucks. Right. And I think what people miss out on is that you can be the star of your own life. And so, it's sort of like stepping out from backstage and running your own show.

[00:24:07.620] - Liz
And that's what I'm all about. And I think when you show up in your own business that way, and when you start looking at your blood like a business, like a company, like a brand, everything's more important. Example time, I was supposed to sing that. That's why I sang it. So, here I am.

[00:24:23.570] - Liz
Here's mine. Right. So hey, I'm Liz Theresa. I help entrepreneurs get clear and rise to be the star of your business through my blog and podcast. Or it could be through coaching website and brand design program.

[00:24:34.170] - Liz
So that my blog and podcast. That's like how I do it. Right. The problem I solve being get clear because most people are not clear. I totally get that you don't know your message and you feel like you're showing up like a big storm cloud and other things because you're all foggy all the time.

[00:24:50.890] - Liz
I help entrepreneurs. Could I be more niche than that? Yes, but you do. You don't feel like everybody. Because if you google had a niche, you're going to just watch hours and hours of videos about Niching.

[00:25:02.570] - Liz
That's not how you arrive at anything organically. Who's ever made a decision that way in life. Try to take things easy and go with the flow and remember this, nothing is permanent. Your messaging and your copy. It is all a living document.

[00:25:16.070] - Liz
I always say branding is a living document too. That's like when people think that they picked a logo and that's it. Look at how many logos like Coca Cola has had. Everybody goes through logo after logo, don't aim for perfection. Just aim to settle into something that resonates with you right now, because when it resonates with you right now, everything will flow like water.

[00:25:38.870] - Liz
But like when you try to force yourself to suddenly be different or do what you think you should be doing, that's the moment you're going to fail. And once you get clear on that message statement using this kind of a template, right? That should synergize anywhere you show up online across your website, bottom of blog posts, in your bio, social media, throughout your content in order for the messaging to be a magnet. Because the thing that makes the messaging magnetic is that you say it all the time.

[00:26:10.530] - Liz
So, it's magnetic when it's in the template like that.

[00:26:13.730] - Liz
Right? That template is just there to help you because it has all the different components that people that are like, quick readers like me. We look for that because everybody's like, do I want you in my world? Yes or no? That's a very quick decision people make when they're reading things online.

[00:26:28.760] - Liz
They don't even know they're making a decision. When they say, I'm not going to click something where I'm going to click it, and then I'm going to leave right away because this isn't for me, right? So thinking about that, you don't have a ton of time, which is why the messaging is the thing that's going to be the linchpin on which conversions and everything else can come. Okay. Because once you get your messaging right, everything else works, because any marketing you do is only as effective as your messaging.

[00:26:55.900] - Liz
And your website is like the number two.

[00:26:58.060] - Liz
But like messaging is number one, and if you ignore it, everything costs you more money. And if you feel foggy about it or like this really annoys you or triggers you, then it means that you should spend your time working on it. So, once we get your messaging as strong and sturdy as Thor, as strong as we can, we can then focus on spending money on the other stuff that you might think is more fun, like funnels or Facebook ads or whatever. I don't know what's hot right now.

[00:27:25.630] - Liz
Everything is exciting to spend money on, right?

[00:27:28.450] - Liz
But you got to get the messaging right first. So, here's some three little steps to get you going right. Review how you're currently showing up. What's your current brand message statement? Do you have one like, do you have one? And it's like hiding. Sometimes that's true.

[00:27:43.720] - Liz
Or if you have one. And the second thing is the kicker here. Does it actually resonate with or align with your goals? So, given everything that we've just been talking about, does it feel edgy? Does it make sense?

[00:27:55.930] - Liz
Give that some thought and then me. Follow me. Say Hi. I would love to hear if you watch this presentation what you thought of it. And if you want, download my free copy class.

[00:28:05.280] - Liz
It's only seven minutes at freecopyvideo.com to work on your messaging. It also talks a lot more about conversion. And I like to say seven minutes in heaven. But like, no making out because you, but like yeah, let me know what you think. Feel free to say Hi.

[00:28:19.850] - Liz
I'd love to meet you. Thanks so much for watching.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.390] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm super excited for this session with Liz Theresa. She is a super amazing copywriter. Just going to her site gives me inspiration and I'm really glad that she could join us today we're going to be talking about copy for your home page. So welcome, Liz. Always good to meet another Liz.

[00:00:27.170] - Liz Theresa, liztheresa.com
I know, I know us Liz's have to stick together I feel.

[00:00:32.220] - Liz S.
Absolutely. So I'm going to let you kind of take it away. And I'm sure I will have questions.

[00:00:39.630] - Liz T.
Oh, no, I can't wait. Definitely. The more questions, the better. I'm really excited to be here. And so with that, I will kind of roll into this for you guys that know me. Welcome back. And I'm so excited to see friendly faces. For those of you that are new to the Liz Theresa brand, I'm excited to make this your first introduction because there is nothing more important than having a wicked good website. As they say here in Massachusetts. We say wicked good all the time.

[00:01:05.250] - Liz T.
So there's nothing more important than having a wicked good website to really reflect your message. And so a lot of these these copy tips, these are going to be things that you don't have to hassle your developer for. You're not going to need to shake down a designer, because as long as you can change the text on your website, these will really empower you to make sure that you're optimizing and making the most of the traffic that you get. Because let's face it, if things are like if you're like, I'm just going to like, you know, throw money onto the Facebook ads to drive traffic to my website.

[00:01:35.160] - Liz T.
And then the website isn't doing its job of converting the people into buyers and potential clients, then like, why don't you just say, I don't know set  your money on fire

[00:01:43.410] - Liz S.
You're throwing money away.

[00:01:45.330] - Liz T.
Yeah, literally like you, I just picture a big dumpster fire of money. In fact, I don't know if you saw this ornament that's been released for 2020, but it's a pink dumpster fire.

[00:01:56.070] - Liz S.
That sounds about right.

[00:01:57.120] - Liz T.
 I saw it and it's it's $20. I was like, it really should be twenty dollars and twenty cents. So I feel like I should tell them, like this occurred to me, but I don't stop even as a shopper. My brain, my brain does not stop. So my background for those of you guys new to me, I have a Podcast it's called Liz on Biz, because people tend to like that. So if you like Podcast, you can totally check it out.

[00:02:19.710] - Liz T.
I'm a copywriter. I'm a website designer. I've been doing this since 2011. So, like, I'm, I'm not I'm a dinosaur in Internet years is what you could say as far as my experience level. I love working with people that are starting and people who are scaling. So wherever you're at or whether you just have an idea on a napkin or you're like, I want to make a lot of money next year, whatever that amount is, I'm excited to know you and just kind of help people follow through on their goals.

[00:02:45.810] - Liz T.
I get so excited to talk about business. You've no idea. And copy is just the best, copy is the best tool because it's using the English language, it's something that's already at your disposal. That in, that I mean, I think people think

[00:03:01.110] - Liz S.
It's powerful,

[00:03:02.000] - Liz T.
It's powerful...But I think copy gets so overcomplicated because of things like thesauruses and people that like to sound smart. So my first copy tip, this is our bonus tip. I mean, I'm not even on tip number one.

[00:03:13.380] - Liz T.
So we'll start with a bonus tip. Bonus pre tip tip is going to be that I want you to throw out your ""ologies"", your ""ism's"" and your ""ations"". And so what are these ologies, ism's and ations? And they're suffixes which indicate that you're using words that you probably don't need to be using and that your language needs to be simpler. And so this is not to say that you should picture that everybody that reads your websites is like five years old, but like, I want you to realize that when something is an easy word, like if you say, Liz, I got a cat, I'm like, OK, that's that's well, that's great.

[00:03:51.630] - Liz T.
That's purrfect. But if you say, Liz, I got a feline, my brain actually has to take an extra step to process the word feline because it's not as easy as cat. It's just an example. Right. So using easy words, this is something that we should always do. That's kind of your pre tip tip. So even in the way that you communicate with clients and customers, whatever is in your autoresponder's, however you show up and talk about your business, people can smell a thesaurus a mile away.

[00:04:18.630] - Liz T.
So if you're ology-ing,and ation-ing and ism-ing you're doing it wrong, so that's number one.

[00:04:24.090] - Liz T.
That's number zero, that we're pre tipping, tip. Our number one is I want you guys to make miscommunication on your homepage impossible.

[00:04:33.960] - Liz T.
So what this is to say is that is to say, ensuring your brand message is completely visible and obvious on your homepage.

[00:04:41.730] - Liz T.
And when I say brand message, a brand message statement, so it can be a one sentence, it could be a series of sentences, maybe like up to five that describe who you are as a business, who you help and the problem that you solve. That's the thing that keeps people from going to your website and being like, oh my gosh, what am I doing here? Like, we don't want people to have that feeling of like I don't know how you fit into my world, because if they don't know how you fit into their world, you've already lost them

[00:05:09.120] - Liz S.
Yeah.

[00:05:10.950] - Liz T.
And, you know, you know, bounce rates and stuff, that's what kind of bounce rates are measuring. So if you have a very high bounce rate and for folks that are unfamiliar with the term of bounce rate,

[00:05:19.020] - Liz S.
We're going to have sessions on that. SEO and analytics and all that good stuff.

[00:05:24.030] - Liz T.
Yes. Well, it represents the percentage of users that leave immediately. OK, so so to make that number not high, we want people to know how you fit into their world and how you fit into their life. So that's why I like to say make miscommunicating your message impossible. That has to be number one if you take nothing away. There's a reason why I said it first.

[00:05:45.690] - Liz S.
Yeah. Yeah. I just I would add, like, if you're not sure, like, it's your, we're so like in our websites that we can't, we sometimes need an outside perspective.

[00:05:55.860] - Liz S.
So I would like post in one of the gazillion Facebook groups you're in, you can post in the Summit one, be like maybe I'll start a thread actually. Post your website thing and then have people to look at it and tell you what they think you're about. Right. Because you think it's crystal clear. But someone else is like, I don't know what you're talking about or it's confusing or there's too many things or so have also, actually we'll do that. We'll do a thread in the Facebook group.

[00:06:20.010] - Liz T.
Yeah.

[00:06:20.440] - Liz S.
And you guys can drop your homepage links in the comments and everyone go and just be like try to kind of help, help each other out, make sure your clear, clear message.

[00:06:29.640] - Liz T.
Definitely. There's also there was a company that used to exist. I don't think they still exist, but it was called peek user testing, like your peeking with your eyes.

[00:06:37.150] - Liz S.
There's like UserBob too. There's, there's a couple for like twenty bucks. You can get 20 people or something to like review your site.

[00:06:43.800] - Liz T.
So worth it! So interesting. Yeah.

[00:06:45.510] - Liz S.
Yeah.

[00:06:46.260] - Liz T.
Wicked interesting and then you get to see the video and there like I think I'm on this kind of website and so it's very cool,

[00:06:52.230] - Liz S.
I think it will surprise you where they gravitate to from your homepage and what they think it's about, because I've done it before and I was like, oh, like, I need to step that up.

[00:07:01.740] - Liz T.
Right?

[00:07:02.790] - Liz T.
Yeah, it's so wild and interesting. And so that's. Yeah. So that's why miscommunicating, avoiding miscommunicating your message, by the by far your most number one, important thing to do.

[00:07:13.530] - Liz T.
Number two is be super chill about your menu so like when you're thinking about your homepage menu and this should be true of all your pages, a lot of these tips will definitely overlap to influence how you approach all your pages. But specifically when it comes to your menu, I say be careful about your menu because I only want you to have five things, max. And if you go to Liz Theresa, you're going to see six. And it's because I break my own rules.

[00:07:34.710] - Liz T.
And if you're going to do, if I say five, I know you're going to do six or seven. But the fact is that the human mind can only remember up to seven things at once, so that, there is a psychological reason why phone numbers used to be seven digits and now I'm dating myself. But and also why you never want more than seven. But I'm telling you five, because in fact, the fewer choices that you give people when it comes to making any sort of decision, the more likely it is that they're actually going to, to make a decision.

[00:08:02.070] - Liz T.
It's sort of like when you're buying a product right, on Amazon, it's it can be like if you know what you're going to buy, you go to buy it and it's over. It's because well, I mean, they do they kind of do this. It's not, they're not a great example. But if you can just go, you know those websites where you can go and just buy that one product. And actually, I just bought this thing called the shift neckless.

[00:08:20.520] - Liz T.
Are you familiar with this where you breathe into it?

[00:08:22.590] - Liz S.
Nope,

[00:08:23.280] - Liz T.
This OK, it's very interesting product called The Shift, and it's I think it's called commuoso design. And essentially it's a necklace you wear to slow down your breathing for folks who have anxiety and that kind of stuff. So the way that they model their entire website, they only have one product. No wonder when people go they buy it because they're not giving you like, here's a necklace, here's a ring, here is a GPS.

[00:08:48.120] - Liz T.
And then you're like, I don't know, irony with a GPS. This GPS made be lost. And I don't know what I'm doing here in that example. So this is to say be very selective with what your top level items are. And remember too, the top level items, these when I say top level item, I mean your menu items, they don't have to represent every every page ever that you have or every page that you've ever made. You're allowed to have submenus. These things are all, I accept them. OK, but I want you to be really cognizant of the information that you choose to include, because when you aren't being really selective about that, that's when websites can be like overgrown.

[00:09:23.670] - Liz T.
Kind of like if you haven't mowed the lawn in a really long time, there's tall grass, there's weeds. It's a need of a spring clean up or fall clean up

[00:09:31.030] - Liz S.
There is a bird's nest in the grass.

[00:09:33.720] - Liz T.
Oh, that's sad. Probably. Probably in my yard. That's possible. And so, yeah, I think that that's that's probably my really important tip number two is to be chill about your menu. And just to recap, number one was make make mis-communicating your message impossible. And number two is limiting your menu to five items. And then the sub tip for that is that sometimes people say blog, but they don't say blog. They'll say like journal or diary or watch my journal.

[00:10:01.590] - Liz T.
And I'm like, no, call a blog, a blog. Yeah. Let's let's just call things what they are. Guys, no need to be creative. It's more important to communicate. It's communication trumps clarity, I mean trumps creativity, even though creativity is great and I'm a creative human. But you always want to be clear,

[00:10:17.980] - Liz S.
There's a time place for it.

[00:10:19.510] - Liz T.
Yes, there is a time and place for it. And so, number three, when you're thinking about your brand message statement.

[00:10:25.510] - Liz T.
So this is the statement that's really important to have. You know, this is the thing that we don't want to be mis-communicating. I want you to make sure it's including the three things, these three things. This is tip number three. The three things are 1. Who you are as a business, 2.Who you help your demographic. And 3. The problem that you're solving. So like your brand message statement, sometimes it can be one sentence. Like I said, it could be a series of sentences that communicates this.

[00:10:54.400] - Liz T.
But when you have it down pat, I want you to like have it. So it's not embarrassing to say out loud. It's something that comes out super naturally and it's something that you could even tailor and pare down to be an Instagram bio. They end up working really, really well there. And so I want you guys to all like when you're looking at brand message statements, I mean, like let's say you do the exercise and your pasting, your website, and everybody's like, are you a tarot card reader?

[00:11:17.260] - Liz T.
And you're like, no.

[00:11:20.140] - Liz T.
Maybe it's like a huge thing that, like, got missed or you said something and, you know, and so I want it to be like painfully obvious. Another way to kind of arrive at your brand message statement, that's really easy without having to answer hard questions, is writing a letter to your best friend about your business. And so I like to have people do this. You can open up a new email in Gmail literally write to your best friend and be like, hey, best friend, besty, you know, my name is Liz Theresa.

[00:11:48.970] - Liz T.
Like, here's what I do with my business: I make websites and I help people use the right words in the right places because I think you know sales copy can be cheesy and I try to make it wicked fun and, you know, and and so people can sell their stuff and not feel like used car salesman. That's how I would probably tell my friend about my business. And so when you think about talking to a friend, you don't have heirs.

[00:12:11.470] - Liz T.
I think a lot of times and this is just because of social media. Everything is so filtered. We always, it's a mindset that you always think that you have to sound better than you are. And when we accept that we're actually enough and where we're good and we're all worth it. That's how everybody says earn your worth, charge, your worth. I'm like, you're worth more than what you charge because you're a human. Such a weird expression.

[00:12:34.840] - Liz T.
I understand it. But this is all to say. Own how you show up and accept that you're showing up as enough. And when and when you accept that, then you're like, OK, I make websites. I could say something like, I am a prestigious website designer who does this, only works with seven figure entrepreneurs, like I can say like all that stuff, but it's just stuff. OK, so they get really clear on just not having the heirs because something that people say about me that I really take this very seriously and it's something that I'm immensely grateful for, is that like people say, I come off very authentic.

[00:13:11.070] - Liz T.
And that's what I want. I couldn't ask for a better thing, I actually did this. This might be a cool action step for folks too, that are, is on Instagram, yesterday, I did a poll and I said, what words come to mind when you think about my brand? And the words were so interesting, right. You should do this. It's wicked fun.

[00:13:31.420] - Liz S.
I'm terrible at Instagram. I'm going to work on it before the summit. We'll see if it's any better by the time the Summit airs.

[00:13:38.160] - Liz T.
Oh, you can do it. I it's the brain. It's like part of anything. It's like anything. It requires practice. And it was, I was blown away. Well one I was excited people responded because sometimes when you do polls you're like, what if people I don't know, I always seem like what if people don't answer that? I'm like, well then I'll be the only one who knows and is disappointed. But what was so great is that they they all kind of said and this kind of surprised me, approachable was said three times, human, human and like all of these other ones, authentic.

[00:14:09.000] - Liz T.
There were words that came up too, fun. But approachable was the one that everybody said.

[00:14:14.460] - Liz T.
And I was like I was like, oh, well, that's that's great and accidental. But I almost wonder when you said you went to my website, you kind of hit on this where you were like you got inspired by my site. And I would I like to think it's because the way that I deliver copy is without heirs. It's in a way that sounds genuinely like me and I. And I feel like that is a useful tactic. Whether or not you are a personal brand, like, yeah, it's always, oh, man, this is getting to tip number four.

[00:14:43.380] - Liz T.
My goodness gracious. Because it's kind of seeping into tip number four. But it's that it's the it's the showing up as you are, in owning your voice. And in a practical sense, what this actually means is, you know, personal brands and non personal brands should use first person whenever possible. That's the truth. Always. Like even, and when you ""we"" you should only ""we"" in your copy, if you're actually a ""we"" so if you're a team and you're speaking contextually as your team, so like ""we, your team believe..."" Are committed to whatever, and that's when the ""we""s are allowed.

[00:15:23.490] - Liz T.
But when you're a personal brand and then you're like, I'm Liz Theresa consulting, we make good websites, but it's really just me. It would be mega weird. Like if the ""we""s, right? Aren't they like they're like the sweater vest copy of the Internet.

[00:15:38.400] - Liz T.
Like they're like, why are you we-ing? You got the patches on my elbow.

[00:15:45.510] - Liz T.
You're like, what are we doing here? And then like I've had the people that we they come to me and they hire me for copy. This has happened before. They'll be like, I've been we-ing because it sounds so professional. And I was like, but like does it? Does it sound real, well? Does it sound clear? And they're like, well, I'm trying to appear to a corporate market. And I'm like, well, the decision makers in corporate are still going to smell it because it's weird.

[00:16:11.430] - Liz T.
It's not like they're not human just because they're corporations. Corporations aren't robot people, are they?

[00:16:16.050] - Liz S.
Well, I've seen some Doctor Who episodes. I'm just kidding.

[00:16:21.780] - Liz T.
You're like, actually.... I'm just kidding.

[00:16:25.830] - Liz T.
We're Liz's.

[00:16:26.840] - Liz S.
And we often we often forget. I think a lot of people forget that companies are people. Right, because and that's true of everyone. Because I'm sure at some point you've gotten an email and I know I've got an email or, you know, like ranting at you and you're like, dude, calm down. Like, I was like, I'm just a person. If you don't like, that's fine. You can leave. But, you know, like people forget that there are people behind the websites.

[00:16:50.490] - Liz T.
Oh, man. And it's so much easier for folks to hide behind email when they say the horrible things.

[00:16:55.950] - Liz S.
Yeah, I feel like I think you've made it though, when you get your first hate email.

[00:17:00.840] - Liz T.
Oh, man, I have. You've also made it when I feel like people start to criticize you and they feel like they're like, will she notice. Yeah, that's when I'm like I made it, like I had a girl be like, oh, she messaged me on Instagram. And she was like, she's like, you look so much younger if you didn't wear eyeliner. And I was like, it's like I've worn I like honestly, you know, it's wild about this.

[00:17:20.730] - Liz T.
I weren't eyeliner since I was like eleven. I'm just so I was moody and so like I was so sassy.

[00:17:27.870] - Liz T.
But then I was like, oh, I just I like, I like that's part of how I look that my life.

[00:17:33.210] - Liz S.
I literally had some this was years ago. Yeah. Like intentionally joined my email list just so she could email me a 800 word like this is why you're wrong and I don't like you. And I was like, there's a contact form.

[00:17:48.940] - Liz T.
You were like it's really the whole time.

[00:17:51.150] - Liz S.
It's like, I was like you to a lot of effort. Like I'm really inspiring some passion. Sweet.

[00:17:57.180] - Liz T.
Yeah.It's almost like the first time you're completely copycatted right where somebody takes your copy, well when you write good copy. Right. That's happened. I had some girl, she copied my entire brand message statement.

[00:18:10.540] - Liz T.
And then she used it as hers, and I know you're supposed to be mad like everybody's mad when this happens, I genuinely was excited that I was noticed enough to be copied.

[00:18:21.610] - Liz T.
I was like,

[00:18:22.330] - Liz S.
It's okay to be so excited. But you should also still do something about it.

[00:18:25.330] - Liz T.
I well, I kind of waited for her to fizzle, and then she fizzled. It was like she was only online, like a few months, I think. And then like...

[00:18:33.700] - Liz S.
I mean, if you can't come up with your own copy and you're like pitching you're a copywriter is not really going to....

[00:18:38.720] - Liz T.
Oh, I it was not going to fly. Right. I know. I was like I was like, oh, that's so cute. I don't know. I'm the worst. You're right. I should have been way more mad. I should have been like, hey!

[00:18:47.950] - Liz S.
It's not that you need to be mad. I'm just saying you need to protect your brand.

[00:18:50.980] - Liz T.
You're so right now, that's good advice. That's why there's I don't know if you're having legal people coming.

[00:18:56.050] - Liz S.
We absolutely are, yes.

[00:18:57.410] - Liz T.
Yeah. I feel like I know so many people like, I don't know. Do you know Hashtag Legal? They're great.

[00:19:03.280] - Liz S.
Yes, Jamie spoke at the 2020 Summit.

[00:19:06.220] - Liz T.
Oh so yeah. So Jamie is, like because I just thought of Jamie when I was like eh, and I'm like Jamie would also be mad I just said that. Because I'm like Jamie would be like ""protect your stuff!""

[00:19:16.900] - Liz T.
It is your content and it's your intellectual property. She is so smart.

[00:19:19.990] - Liz S.
And she did an amazing session last year.

[00:19:22.120] - Liz T.
People that work in that space. Very interesting. And this is also to say that copywriting too copywriting, I'm talking about the words, but like sometimes people think that copywriters like me know about copyright and like I only know like...

[00:19:34.510] - Liz S.
Different things.

[00:19:35.800] - Liz T.
Right, the surface of it. Exactly, and that I would only say and then the legal people know it better. Is that like when you write something you have inherent, a basic copyright by writing it and then after that you have to hire a person. That's the only thing I know about copyright... 

[00:19:50.290] - Liz S.
Let's leave that to the legal sessions.

[00:19:52.150] - Liz T.
We will leave it to the legals. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd like to get so number five, this is my tip number five. There are certain phrases that compel to sell. And so this is kind of what I'm calling number five, which is a great name of a freebie, compel to sell. I haven't done that yet, but it's so catchy. But one of the best phrases that you can start to inject into your existing copy is just the words ""like you.""

[00:20:15.760] - Liz T.
So this sounds very simple. But like like I said before, when you're thinking about the the reflexive tone of speech, right, where you're like, I'm in the first person that's going to do the first step of being more personal, even if you are not a personal brand, this is important. Right. And then when you make it reflexive and you say, you know, I help entrepreneurs like you, jazz hands, then in that person, the reader's mind, they're like me.

[00:20:46.300] - Liz T.
So like even if they're like the reader who's like, I'm very skeptical, I don't believe in anything. The second they say, like you, they mean, who, me? Instantly. Because when we as people read the word you, our brain goes me every single time. Just because we were I don't know, we speak the language. We know how words work together. So the second that you add ""like you"" to anything. I mean, I always keep ""like you"" in my brand message statement.

[00:21:09.880] - Liz T.
That's a really good place to ""like you"" if you're going to use it as a verb. Always, always in sales copy. Always you always want to do the ""like you's"" because the ""like you-s"" are also getting to the heart of the problem. Right. And I have kind of touched on the problem earlier. And so this may be tip six. I maybe have more than five.

[00:21:29.560] - Liz S.
That's OK.

[00:21:30.220] - Liz T.
I think, I think you'll forgive me, but like when you're touching on the, ""like you-s"" because you're then getting into the head of the reader, the way to make them stay and keep their attention is that they feel they're in a place that understands them.

[00:21:46.060] - Liz T.
For somebody to feel in a place of being understood, they need to have their problem repeated to their face. So that's why your brand message statement, it's really important to capture your problem that you solve.

[00:21:57.850] - Liz T.
OK, and that's why too on sales pages and in sales copy in general, you often see things like ""can you imagine"" or like ""do you ever think..."" or like have ""you ever experienced...."" or even like on commercials for horrible prescription medication? Because there's so many different types. Right. You'll see them walking with the partner like I can't keep up with my grandkids and then they're like rubbing their hip.

[00:22:23.710] - Liz T.
So it's like people need to see their problem being illustrated before their eyes in the way of copy and the ""like you: will get your brain also going in that direction and it will also help the person reading be able to say, yes, you fit into my world because that right. The brand message statement is like the shorter way to do this. But then the longer way to do it is to to have to have time being spent on the pain.

[00:22:49.510] - Liz T.
So the pain of like, you know, I totally get that you don't want to write copy yourself and you'd rather like staple your laptop until it breaks or like throw it in front of traffic or, you know what I mean?

[00:23:01.000] - Liz T.
Like, you can be kind of creative, you know.

[00:23:04.690] - Liz S.
Yeah, chuck it out the window.

[00:23:05.420] - Liz T.
Set it, set it on fire. Yes. Yeah. Oh my God. I could go so, so many dark places with that, but like it's true, right? So as long as that's that's more compelling than ""I'm Liz I write copy."" And I think so often this kind of like this sort of like sneaks and seeps its way into the strategy that you use when you approach all aspects of your content marketing, not just your copy for your homepage, but like when you're showing up as your business on social media, are you talking enough about the problems or are you spending time being like, I have a lunch, everybody look at my lunch?

[00:23:41.410] - Liz T.
You know? Not to say that you shouldn't be salesy, you know, and not to say that because it's important that people know who you are and what you're actually selling, how you you know, what to buy and what to do with you, how to give you money.

[00:23:55.000] - Liz S.
This is a, that's a problem other people have, is that they never actually sell.

[00:23:59.020] - Liz T.
Yeah, but that is a, that's another like another day, another talk for another day. But yeah. Like having a mix of posts. You got to mix up your content too like you want to have engaging kind of content like I did a wicked good one. Oh my God. This would be fun for your group, maybe you could borrow it. But like if your business was a desert, what desert would you be and why?

[00:24:21.530] - Liz T.
Yeah, and I took me some time, but I was like I'd so be a banana split because all the hot fudge is the fun with like a lot of hot fudge fun. Yeah. That's just what I decided because big ostentatious, a little ridiculous, funny looking, bananas, you know, that's very me. So but like that's one type of content that I post. But then the other times it'll be like, girl, why don't you accept, why are you accepting less than you deserve in your life and your business?

[00:24:47.770] - Liz T.
What if you knew how to show up and use the right words? What if your brand reflected how you felt inside and you didn't feel like you were just yelling in the dark room to tell people to buy things? That's how people feel about copy. And it's the biggest shame in the world because I feel like they should just go, they should take what's theirs. They should look at it more simply. They shouldn't think of it as like...

[00:25:07.750] - Liz S.
Really like pretend you're telling your best friend. Like, I think that actually the greatest advice because the more you, because you're not talking down to, you don't talk down to your best friend. You're not trying to show that you're smart. You're just, you're honest and you're straight to the point. And that's really what people respond to.

[00:25:27.070] - Liz T.
Yeah. And also too I think sometimes people get, they do get let down. I think that there's still a lot of us that measure our success in likes and in sales and all these different things our business can do. But you get what you give is what I would advise people that are like, I'm waiting for these things to happen. I'm doing all the right things, I'm doing the right copy and all that. And I'm like, well are you engaging with your people that would normally buy from you?

[00:25:50.710] - Liz T.
How are you making your, show up and be a part of their world? People don't accidentally get married. Do you know what I mean, like, you've to ask somebody to marry you, so in the same line...

[00:26:01.360] - Liz T.
I'd be like, it's not so crazy to be a little bit like here I am, to people that should hire you. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's what I would say in my five or six, seven tips. I know I got a little excited.

[00:26:14.610] - Liz S.
That's OK. Those were awesome. Just to sort of recap, you want to make sure that there is no confusion on your homepage, that your message is super clear. And a great way to do that, a nice action step is to have an outside perspective.

[00:26:25.950] - Liz S.
So whether you do UserBob or you post it in the thread in the Facebook group, there will be a designated thread. So don't just go dropping links, but a designated thread where people can kind of help you out. The second one was keep your menu simple and clean and no more than five so that you're not forcing decision fatigue on people, which is a real thing. It's a psychological thing. Make sure you,r make sure I'm checking my notes.

[00:26:51.490] - Liz S.
You know,

[00:26:51.970] - Liz T.
You're so good.

[00:26:53.940] - Liz S.
So tip number three was your your statement should cover who you are, who you help and the problem your solving.

[00:27:00.060] - Liz T.
Yes.

[00:27:00.730] - Liz S.
OK, and then get rid of the the the ""we""s everywhere.

[00:27:06.830] - Liz T.
The fake ""we""s

[00:27:08.130] - Liz S.
No one wants to link you're like peeing on your copy. But sorry, that was really bad pun. So get rid of the ""we""s and then you know. Oh, what was the last one?

[00:27:21.080] - Liz T.
Oh! The ""like you""

[00:27:23.210] - Liz S.
The like you, make it make, show people that you can relate, you know, like you, I constantly didn't have enough time to blog. like you....

[00:27:31.620] - Liz T.
Yes.

[00:27:33.310] - Liz S.
The kids are home from school and I'm screwed.

[00:27:37.450] - Liz S.
Whatever the case may be, you know, whatever that struggle is like, be honest and open with it.

[00:27:42.640] - Liz S.
I think I kind of hit on all your tips, right?

[00:27:45.120] - Liz T.
Yeah, you did so great.

[00:27:46.330] - Liz T.
And then the pre tip tip was using simple words, ditching the ""ologies"" ""isms"" and ""ations"" as much as possible.

[00:27:52.660] - Liz S.
Yes. So I think that gives people a lot of things to do. I definitely should probably be reviewing my homepage, but then go review their homepage. They can go get that outside perspective. They can clean up that copy, change you to, or ""we"" to I and throw in some ""like you-s"" and. Yeah, awesome. Any any final words. Where can people learn more about you get awesome stuff from you?

[00:28:14.740] - Liz T.
Oh so I have a free copywriting training that goes a little bit deeper and it's at freecopyvideo.com. And so if people are getting a little curious to go a little deeper and more nerdy with their copy, they can get their free training video there. It's only seven minutes and I like to call it seven minutes of heaven, but it's not really like ,we don't make out. But it's fun. So you can go there. Also, check me out anywhere, at Liz Theresa, L-I-Z-T-H-E-R-E-S-A or on liztheresa.com.

[00:28:42.790] - Liz S.
Yes. And links to all that stuff should be on this page. I'm not sure where it is at this moment, but it'll be here, it's somewhere. And thank you Liz, so much. I appreciate you taking the time to give these amazing tips for copy writing.

[00:28:55.660] - Liz T.
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

[00:00:12.540] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm really excited to have the speaker back because it's always a good time talking to her. She helps entrepreneurs clarity and market themselves online with confidence. She's been in business for over a decade, helping to create powerful, high-converting websites, memorable brands, and coaching business owners on how they can be more visible online. Because she wants everyone, every entrepreneur like you, to rise and be the star of their own business. Because a big break isn't something you wait for, it's something you make. So, super excited. Liz Theresa is back. Liz, thank you again for joining us. I love chatting with you.

[00:00:46.180] - Liz Theresa
Oh, my God. Same. We're terribly awesome together too. So, I'm thrilled to be here.

[00:00:51.910] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Yes. So, we're going to be talking about mission statements. Before we really dive in, let's maybe explain what that is.

[00:01:00.520] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. No, I think it's funny because I think if you ask people on the street what's a mission statement, they might say, like, it's something a nonprofit has, and then they're like, that's like your first thing. You're like, well, it's for people that save whales, or it's for people that you know are fixing the ozone layer. But the truth is that we all have mission statements. It's just a matter of not, like whether or not you're looking at it or not, or whether or not you seek to acknowledge it. It's sort of when I say everybody has a brand, it's just whether or not you want to acknowledge it, it's going to be out in the room with you all the time. Your mission is always there too. It's just not always articulated.

[00:01:43.690] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I think it's almost articulating what your values are to a certain extent, right. Because you will see because it happens when you see someone they're like. I don't really like how they do that in their business. Well, that's establishing what your values are, which is how you're different. And it's not that you think anything like if that's their thing, right, but not quite the same.

[00:02:06.250] - Liz Theresa
Well, values is one of my favorite thing to amplify because people don't amplify it enough. But what a wonderful example I'm calling it out because it is. It's when you, values is when you smell somebody's smell and you're like, oh, I don't like that, that's stinky. And you know not to be that way.

[00:02:21.790] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Okay. So, now we have an idea that, yes, everyone's going to have a mission statement whether they realize it or not. Let's talk about what copywriting is because it's a little bit of a scary term for some people. And we are talking about copywriting in the sense of writing copy or words as opposed to the legal sense. We have other sessions on that. But if you want to kind of explain copywriting, so people cannot forget about it.

[00:02:49.210] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. and I would say, so when you write your mission statement, it would be part of the copywriting for your website. And copy, I like to make it so simple, it's any words you use in your marketing anytime. So, marketing being the big globby word for your website, any physical materials, and anytime you talk about your business, that's all copy, and it's the written form for it.

[00:03:14.890] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. So, how do you come up with a mission statement?

[00:03:18.750] - Liz Theresa
No, this is such a good question. So, I came up with a little template for everybody listening today because I wanted to make it easy. And I'm calling this your one-sentence version of your mission. Aside from kind of communicating values, too, what I like to remind people is that it communicates your impact and the difference that you make in people's lives. What's funny is that when I started my business, I remember specifically not thinking about other people. I just really didn't want a job, and so that's just the truth. I didn't want to work for anybody. I had a bad boss. I was like, that's not for me. So, when I started my business, I thought I was starting it, so I could get like a mani pedi whenever I wanted, so I could make some money, buy an iPad. I didn't have like, I think it's sometimes we have to remember to have a pulse that we do make an impact. It's whether or not we notice. So, it's sort of like the mission idea. When I'm like, you have a mission, it's whether or not you articulate it. You make an impact by existing.

[00:04:20.050] - Liz Theresa
It's whether or not you're seeking to notice that .That's personal and professional, too. You know like the chain of love and the drivethru when you pay for the person behind you, that really makes a difference. And in your business, you're making a difference all the time. Or your blog, don't minify it because you are making an impact. You're making an impact on your reader. So, came up with a snappy template. It's a fill in the blank. And so, I'm going to guide you guys through that now. And so, it's I help blank, and I'm going to tell you what the blanks are, but you could even put this on a piece of paper, but the first blank is my ideal reader. So, think of your ideal demographic. I help moms, I help dads. I help not parents. I help women in service-based businesses. So, I help blank by providing blank. And so that second blank is the value that you provide. And so, the value is usually blog articles written weekly. It could be podcast recordings delivered monthly. It could be a group of things. So, think of all the different ways you're providing value. And sometimes that's easier to write before you write the sentence.

[00:05:28.840] - Liz Theresa
But I love a good template because it makes you walk away with something lovely. And so, I help my ideal reader by providing valuable content, probably, or something like that, so they can blank. And then I have another extension to the sentence for the really aspirational listeners, I want to add on, but I want to explain this blank first. But it goes so I help my ideal readers by providing valuable content, so they can, ideal results. So ideal result meaning like, in a perfect world, if they came to your blog and website and you could wave your Liz wands and like, they make them come out on the other side of the problem that you solve. So, whatever the problem you solve is as a website, what's this ideal outcome? I help people that come to my website, love their website because I'm teaching them how to love their website because all of a sudden their website is a lead converter. Okay, that's an example of one. So what is your ideal outcome for travel bloggers that specialize in a location? This is just an example. I help you come to Miami and know what it is to see when you get here because the city's really freaking awesome.

[00:06:42.060] - Liz Theresa
And here's all the reasons why. Just an example. So you could think about what that ideal statement is. And that's the thing that you slot in. What were you going to say? Because you're going to say something.

[00:06:52.390] - Liz Stapleton
No, I'm just in my head going through it, being like, I help bloggers and aspiring bloggers, you know, by providing annual summit with amazing actionable training so that they can earn more with their blog and work less.

[00:07:07.690] - Liz Theresa
If I highfive my monitor, it would get hurt. But I want to because that was so good. What a fabulous example. So, then actually you did this SEO then, so they can tell us what it was.

[00:07:20.280] - Liz Stapleton
So, they can spend less time working on their blog and earning more or something like that.

[00:07:24.510] - Liz Theresa
Okay, yeah.

[00:07:24.910] - Liz Stapleton
Definitely, like rewind the recording and be like, what did I say?

[00:07:28.050] - Liz Theresa
No, that was really lovely. Okay, and then, so for people that did this first part, and you guys want to like add some vision to your mission, because sometimes people think of mission, vision and values, they all get kind of, like they're all swimming in the same pond, you know what I'm saying? So, if you want to make this mission statement also visionary in nature and touch on a vision statement without having to write one, you could also add so that to the end of the sentence. So, like, if you're helping bloggers make more money with their blog, so that they can what was it? Not have to work that hard in their life. So, they could spend less time working on their working and more time, living their life, hugging their puppy. Everybody should get a puppy. But yeah, no that's, I thought, but yeah, when you do that so they can, that's where you get people right in the fields. In good missions, get people in the fields because it increases, like know and trust. And it also gives people a reason to think of you as a community. Because everybody's like, oh, I'm a community. This is a community.

[00:08:34.540] - Liz Theresa
Join my community. I saw an ad or some kind of post about, like, I just want to buy socks. So, I don't have to join a community to buy socks. Like some people do say that.

[00:08:43.630] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah.

[00:08:44.530] - Liz Theresa
But some brands really are communities because you know what they stand for. You'll pay $20 for bombas, those are comfy. Those are the socks.

[00:08:54.430] - Liz Stapleton
They are really comfortable. i have some.

[00:08:55.470] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. I kind of get it with them, I feel like they justify it.

[00:09:01.480] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. All right. So, I love the sort of like, fill in the blank aspect of it, but it can get super wordy. It can get super long. So, how long really should kind of your, I mean, obviously you can have, like, a long mission statement somewhere on your site, but you're, like, go to it's on your social. Actually, let's step back. Where would you put your mission statement, this nice little thing you've come up with?

[00:09:29.080] - Liz Theresa
I like to have it easily accessible on every page, if possible. Even if it was silently in your sidebar or footer, you always want to be communicating it. It can become a long run on sentence by the fill in the blank exercise. So, if you broke it into two, you wouldn't be breaking hearts. You'd be helping ears and eyes. So, it's totally okay to do that. I'm not the person that goes so far as to say you have to put it in every single bio everywhere, but you want it to be very, very clear. There are possibilities too, when you think about blogging, that you could append it to the beginning of every post in italics, as, like, a quiet thing that you say every single time you publish new content. Because then it kind of reminds people who you are, what you stand for, and why should I read you and not somebody else? It can kind of reinforce that, and it increases your brand equity. It makes you seem way more important than you might even know you are, because you are important. This is the thing I want to, like, shake everyone.

[00:10:28.140] - Liz Theresa
You all matter. You really do. It's very Mr. Rogers, but it's true. And the second you accept and believe that, the more likely other people will believe it, too.

[00:10:38.660] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. You know, I feel like don't make the mistake of just maybe you don't have a huge audience or as huge of an audience. Like don't compare yourself. Even if you have a small audience, you're making a difference for those people, and it matters. So, don't let comparisons sort of ruin that realization.

[00:10:58.780] - Liz Theresa
And a lot of people, I saw a post last night where somebody said two people bought her program or something, whatever she was selling, from a post that got no engagement, no likes, no comments. And sometimes when we get no likes, no comments on a post we make about a blog post. Right. It's a little meta, but then we think, well, this silence, so all I got was crickets. Well, no, crickets read. Jiminy was very well read, you know. So that's what I would say.

[00:11:29.510] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. You know because not everyone comments, even like and I know that it would be like, so appreciated. Right. And I still like, people are busy. It doesn't mean not commenting or something, doesn't mean they didn't absolutely love it or find a lot of value in it.

[00:11:46.150] - Liz Theresa
It's true. Good reminder.

[00:11:49.840] - Liz Stapleton
It's hard to get people to take action to tell you you're awesome.

[00:11:52.910] - Liz Theresa
And it's the same reason why I think people will start blogs and quit too early. Because they expect it to be like, I blogged, therefore I am. And it's not always like this big show, you know. 

[00:12:05.620] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I would think I give it at least a year. Everyone who I think does it for at least a year is like, [inaudible 00:12:09] forever.

[00:12:11.590] - Liz Theresa
Yeah, they get it too. And it's like an education.

[00:12:14.440] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Okay. So, now we kind of talked about different places you're going to have your mission statement. Let's talk about length, because it can get really long, it can get really wordy, kind of what's the ideal? How do you trim the fat? What you know tips you have in that regard?

[00:12:30.260] - Liz Theresa
I usually say they should be two to three sentences max in general. So, like, don't confuse a mission with your about page. So, sometimes I think a common mistake that happens is people tell a story in a mission. When you can allude to the story, just thinking of an example. Like, I think Patagonia's mission that's like the company with the really nice coats. And so basically their mission is something like, oh, we started as, something about how they started really small, like a mom and pop, people that made backpacks or something. And then now look at us today. You can like allude to something like that. But the reason why I gave you the template is because I don't want you to say more than those blanks. Those are the big things, the checkboxes to communicate, especially if you're also going to spend time and write a vision statement, because your vision statement is also short. But that's like when people think about missions and visions, I have to make your mission a little aspirational. And then you have two in one. It's less, right. It's less stuff to read for people, but visions, like, if you ever wanted to know what a vision was, it's really like your Oprah statement, I'm changing lives every day because Liz Theresa's this, that and the other.

[00:13:44.550] - Liz Theresa
I'm the number one. Dah dah dah dah dah dah. You know, and it might not be true stuff, but it's stuff that you're aspiring to be true. Okay. So that's something that people get confused. If you make your mission a little aspirational, you get two to three sentences and you can accomplish your goal.

[00:13:59.660] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah. Because what is the goal of the mission statement, in case anyone is a little unclear on that?

[00:14:06.420] - Liz Theresa
So, in my opinion, it defines your values it says why you're doing what you're doing and the impact that you're making. And then the side effect of saying it is that it helps you adhere to those values from a content creation standpoint, because then as you're creating and planning your content, you're going to be like, naturally in alignment. They'll make you less scattered and more niche. Everybody's all like, I got a niche. I got a niche down. I got to find my ideal reader. Well, they're not hanging out somewhere, but if you do this kind of an exercise, you might settle on who they are a little bit more clearly and think about them more consciously in your own marketing. So, internally, very helpful. Externally, your reader will know how you can fit into their reality. So, then your blog becomes something that like, oh, you know, I'm going to check and see what Elizabeth would say about this. Because, like, I know and I trust her because I know she does this stuff. And they might know and trust you because you've been so explicit, but that's what this community is about.

[00:15:05.290] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. So, it's also helping to define your community, and the community you're creating, I think, is kind of woven in there.

[00:15:15.030] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. Except that you're creating a community whether or not you notice. There's so many things we do, and it's whether or not we notice or willing to call it that.

[00:15:23.960] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, exactly. The other thing I realized the other day is I'm like, if I were to look at you know, someone's blog and give them advice. You know, okay, now I need to turn around and follow my own advice, because you don't even realize, like, oh, yeah, this is how you do it. But then you look back and you're like, oh, apparently I'm not actually doing that right now.

[00:15:43.540] - Liz Theresa
Makes me wonder about Liz Theresa. But yes, I'm with you. Okay. We do say our mission statements on the home page. Mission vision statement, if you actually want to look at mine, you guys. So good. It's really good. I like it a lot.

[00:15:58.960] - Liz Theresa
I like it a lot. And some people also feel, too, that they're living documents, and I would subscribe to that as well, which is to say, like, you could write something. You don't have to feel like, nothing in life is in stone. Nothing is permanent. So, it should be okay to update it. Oh, gosh, yeah.

[00:16:16.760] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, Yeah. But you don't want to like update it every month?

[00:16:19.980] - Liz Theresa
No, once a year.

[00:16:22.660] - Liz Stapleton
Okay.

[00:16:23.310] - Liz Theresa
And even then, it wouldn't be a big update. It might be like, well, do I really value that the same way that I used to?

[00:16:29.960] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because you'll pivot and stuff, too. Okay. So, if someone is struggling, even with your amazing templates, to come up with a clear mission statement, what advice would you have for them? What are some ways they can kind of work through that?

[00:16:47.380] - Liz Theresa
One of my favorite things to do is terrible bad writing, which I consider to be an exercise. So, if you could pick out a fresh piece of paper, if you're a real person that writes with your hand, or if you're a robot person like me, and you use the computer, pull up a brand new fresh dot. And I really think, like, if I said to you, why do you have this blog? And you really wrote all the different reasons why and you made like a why list about it, doesn't have to be good writing again, messier the better, because I don't want you to filter out the genius that is going to come out of you. And in there, in your why is oftentimes your mission. You'll see your impact in your why.

[00:17:28.090] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, I like that because then you kind of pick and choose different terms that come to mind as it goes. Next question is, what are mistakes you see in people, you knwo? I know you already said confusing it with an about page, but what are some other mistakes you see people making with their mission statement, you know, in crafting it and not displaying it or in displaying it weirdly? I don't know. Like you would know.

[00:17:55.110] - Liz Theresa
Oh, yeah. No, definitely. I think one of the most common mistakes is that I think because it's called a mission statement, it sounds so lofty and it sounds so regal and like stately, but I don't want you to lose your brand voice when creating it. It should still sound like something that you might actually say that you're doing. It's just something that you have to say that you're doing without laughing or without sounding like, I don't know, like a strange politician. Because sometimes, I think people make them sound stately and they use really grandiose words, even like the word grandiose is grandiose, right? And it's not necessary. I just want you to say what it is, you know?

[00:18:37.390] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, you know speak like or write like you talk, I should say.

[00:18:42.410] - Liz Theresa
Yeah, yeah. Because then people can hear it and understand it and absorb it better.

[00:18:47.290] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Because I wasn't kidding when I said I was going to go back to this recording and be like, what did I say because that sounded good when I said it.

[00:18:53.380] - Liz Theresa
it's so good. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.

[00:18:58.310] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, any final tips in sort of crafting a magnetic mission statement, as you put it in the title to draw people in? Any final tips?

[00:19:09.780] - Liz Theresa
Well, I think they can all learn a lesson from you in a good way, which is to say if your natural way of communicating is talking, maybe have a conversation with somebody about it and see what comes. If you were to talk instead of write. Because sometimes writing I know that we're all bloggers, but this is a different kind of writing. And so, sometimes when you're doing this weird kind of writing, you get weird. And if you're getting all funny when you're trying to do it, maybe talk to your mum or your best friend, just like, get it out. And then you'll be like, oh, it's so simple now. And then they'll repeat it back to you if it's not a recorded conversation. That's the key.

[00:19:46.240] - Liz Stapleton
There you go. Yeah, but don't be afraid to record. Go for a walk it out.

[00:19:50.610] - Liz Theresa
No, don't be afraid. Yeah. Great tip.

[00:19:52.500] - Liz Stapleton
All right. Now, I know you have some awesome stuff. You want to see our attendees, too? Why don't you tell us about it?

[00:19:59.530] - Liz Theresa
Yeah, you guys, I have a free copy class for starters at freecopyvideo.com. It's a great thing, great tool that exists. Only a seven minute class, so you won't be, you know, learning your life away watching it already. [crosstalk 00:20:17] I know, right? Enough learning, we're all done. And then the other thing. Should I tell them about the other all access?

[00:20:24.150] - Liz Stapleton
Yes.

[00:20:25.310] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. So, the all access pass kind of rad, you guys, because every single Monday, I send out a social media post template, and this is my contribution. It's a membership called the social post sub. S,o everybody that's in the all access will be able to get a one year subscription for free, which is kinda cool.

[00:20:45.790] - Liz Stapleton
That's amazing.

[00:20:47.010] - Liz Theresa
I know.

[00:20:47.670] - Liz Stapleton
If you guys haven't gotten your all access pass yet, then go grab it, because I might need to sign up for that.

[00:20:54.910] - Liz Theresa
Oh, it's very fun. Yeah

[00:20:56.230] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, so. Okay, Liz, again, thank you so much, so much value out of this. You know I hope everyone took notes. If you guys have questions, ask away in the comments. We'll be live. This is pre-recorded, but will be in the comments. And thank you again.

[00:21:12.340] - Liz Theresa

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.820] - Liz Wilcox, lizwilcox.com
Hello, I am Liz Willcox, I am so excited to be a part of this Summit thanks for picking my video out of all of those videos to watch. This is called Write It Yourself How Bloggers Can Write Their Own Copy in three easy Steps. Now, let me tell you, look at this. I feel like I'm in the middle of a party here. So let me tell you this. Number one, I want to keep this really simple.

[00:00:36.910] - Liz
When I say three easy steps, I mean it. This is going to be a pretty quick video. I don't want you taking copious amounts of notes. I'll make a little ding, so can hear that. I'll make a little ding sound when you need to listen up or I'm going to my next point. Really, you probably these are so simple, you probably don't even need to write them down. And then at the end, obviously, I've got a freebie for you if you want it.

[00:01:06.190] - Liz
If not, no harm done. You got the info you needed. Like, seriously, this is three easy steps. So who I am, I'm not just another Liz in the Summit, but I've been blogging for about four years. I've been copywriting, right now I mainly focus on email marketing. You see some of the digital products I've created over the years. Some people have even said nice things about me. But basically all you need to know is that I like to keep things really super simple.

[00:01:38.620] - Liz
And first I had a blog and now I do email marketing and copywriting. So as far as copy goes, seriously, this is how simple I want to keep it for you. There's only really two two things that you need to know about copywriting in order to be successful. Number one, you have to be clear. I know we want to be clever. And, you know, even the title of this talk was write it yourself like that's cutesie, right?

[00:02:06.790] - Liz
But here's the subtitle, How Bloggers Can Write Their Own Copy in three easy steps. That is super clear, right? You don't want to, you don't want to be clever when you sacrifice being clear.

[00:02:18.430] - Liz
And number two show who you are. Obviously, you're watching a video. You can kind of see who I am. Like, obviously, I probably have a kid. There's still like a Halloween bucket, even though you're probably watching this in January. I'm wearing my N*sync earrings.

[00:02:34.570] - Liz
I've got you know, I've got these crazy glasses. This headband, this wild hair. So you can see my personality and you can kind of get a sense for who I am. So you want to try to do that in your copy. And I'm going to show you, I know that's the most like, ""ug, how do I do that Liz like that's so easy to say."" And, you know, especially you Liz have this loud personality. But I'm going to show you one of these steps, how to, like, just show who you are.

[00:03:07.360] - Liz
So let's get right into it. Here's the thing, OK? That means listen up. So Number one, I want you to use swipe files. And if you don't know what a swipe file is, I'm going to show you. But basically a swipe file is like a Google doc or a PDF that someone like me, a copywriter or maybe an old school blogger has put together for inspiration. A swipe file is not a template. It doesn't mean you can take it.

[00:03:40.630] - Liz
It's not like an ad lib thing where it's like blank here, like insert your product here. You know, it's not a template, but it can be used as kind of a pseudo template where you go in, you look at it, you get inspiration, you kind of see how the flow of an email or a sales page or your website copy works so that you can take it and make it your own. Use this swipe file to take and make your own, ok? Take and make your own see simple as that.

[00:04:10.390] - Liz
Right. So I'm going to actually show you a file. So this is actually my freebie. This is my freebie for everything, not just the Summit. It's a swipe file and it gives you a welcome sequence newsletter, examples and fifty two subject lines. But the welcome sequence, as you can see, you can just scroll through and you know, this is the email I sent out to everyone that first email. Let me click on it here so I can you know, this is the second email, the third, the fourth.

[00:04:45.790] - Liz
And you can just read through these and I'm not the only copy writer in the world that has these. You can probably just Google email, swipe files or sales page files and find them. But I also want to show you how to make your own. So what I do, this is my personal email account and so lets say, you know, I go to my inbox, I've got all these emails, Lanie Lamare, she's amazing. Let's say that I really like this email and you know, it does something for me.

[00:05:20.480] - Liz
I want to write something like this one day. What I'm going to do and this is for me, remember, I'm creating my own swipe file right now. So I'm going to send this and I'm doing this live right now. So I am just going to send this to myself over in my business account because I keep my personal on Hotmail and I keep my business over here. Outlook, it looks like we just got a new email and I'm going to take this email.

[00:05:49.640] - Liz
I'm going to click on it. This is the one that I did. Now you all have my personal account. Please don't spam it. And I'm going to move this to an account or to a folder I call Copy Inspiration, and I'll go down here and show you. And this is where I keep, where I mostly keep all of my swipe files, emails that I find that I really like. And then also, so and then you go to your Google Drive.

[00:06:21.350] - Liz
I want you to do this. And where is it? I keep it right here. Marketing swipes. So this is where you can put. So what I showed you was obviously email related, but this is where you can actually keep, you know, full webinar sequences, sales pages, things like that that make sense for you. So I hope that makes sense. Let me pull back up my screen. Where am I? OK, here we are.

[00:06:58.850] - Liz
OK, sorry, and I lost my scene. I'm OK anyway, so that is a swipe file. I hope that makes sense for you. And let's move on to the second tip. See, super simple. Also, remember, I have swipe files. Other copywriters have swipe files. We want you to use these. I want you to go and find sales pages that you like and a print, print the actually, let me show this. This is completely not something that I wanted or that I had planned on showing.

[00:07:36.380] - Liz
But let me just show you. So here we go. So I have something called It's in my chrome. Where is it? Here it is. Nope, sorry. It's called Go Full Page. It's an extension and you can click on this and it screen captures everything. So it's going to say you like a sales page, you go to my website, you like my home page, you, you like the Summit, Blogger Breakthrough Summit page and you can screen shot it and then you can download it to a PDF and then you can put it right here in your marketing swipes.

[00:08:17.760] - Liz
Does that make sense? All right, so moving on, this is a tip that I don't see a lot of copywriters using, but it seriously has saved me so much time, effort, exhaustion, write your copy on paper first. So obviously, if you're talking about your new email newsletters, no, you don't need to write it on paper first. But when you're talking about writing your homepage, copy your sales page, copy something that's really maybe a sales email that you really want to get.

[00:08:49.230] - Liz
Right. I suggest writing it out on paper first. I have all sorts of notebooks let me show you, this one, actually, this one is pretty full and it's all, it's all the emails, everything I've ever want to write. So this is on the top TVC Black Friday email sequence. And you can see I've even written like I'm going to send it Tuesday, the 24th. This is the subject line. And then here's the content. And I do this for two reasons.

[00:09:20.400] - Liz
And the first being, it stops you from editing yourself. So when you pull up a Google doc or however Microsoft Office, however you do your emails or your sales page copy or whatever, when you go to write your copy, when you're staring at that blank, that blank screen, it's so intimidating. And then let's say you write three sentences and then in your brain you have a better idea. So you immediately erase at least two of those sentences and you start over.

[00:09:48.460] - Liz
And so you're constantly editing yourself. Does this resonate? Does this make sense? Like raise your hand if when you write something on paper, Number one, it takes a longer time. And so when it takes a longer time, you don't want to edit yourself as much. Right? Like, I'm trying to see. So here's some emails I was writing today, and I'll pull these up on my docs in a second. And so I'm like this.

[00:10:13.410] - Liz
I literally wrote out name. Right. That takes a while. So I don't want to keep editing. You see, like I haven't scratched out not s-h-i-t. I haven't scratched out anything. But when I go to and let me show it to you, I'm going to share my screen again. When I go to write the emails, that's when I can edit. So that's I haven't even typed this one out yet. But email four which is what I just showed you here.

[00:10:45.060] - Liz
It's going to go here. And as I'm typing it out, that's when I can do all the editing. That's when I can say I don't really like the way I worded the sentence. It would be better this way or that way. And so that is what that is why I suggest you write it out on paper first. You're going to get it out quicker. It might seem kind of counterintuitive, like why would I, why would I do that?

[00:11:13.260] - Liz
You know, it's it's faster to type. You just said it was it takes longer to write it. But the thing is, most of us, especially as bloggers, we cannot self, we can't help but self edit. We write, we write for a living. Right. We're content creators. We can't help but self edit. And so when you write it on paper, first you get rid of all that self editing and then when you type it up, when you get your homepage ready to go, you can type it up and that's when you can self edit and it's going to save you so much time.

[00:11:45.240] - Liz
I promise. Try it. All right. So that was the first thing was, you know, use swipe files, number two write it down on paper. And this is the third and final thing. See it like I told you, simple. Here's my little sound effect. Ask yourself, would I really say this? OK, so I want to show this in action as well. You know, when when you're typing it back. So, number one, you've got your Swipe file open.

[00:12:18.270] - Liz
You know, you're writing your sales page. OK, you know, these are the FAQs, this is, these are my bonuses, whatever, whatever, you know, and then you go to type it once you've got it typed out. I want you to read it out loud or in your head, whatever your style is, you do you. I want you to ask yourself, would I really say this? Because if you get my swipe files, of the way that I talk is completely different than the way you talk, then the way Liz Stapleton talks, then the way whoever talks, everyone talks or says things in a different way.

[00:12:59.550] - Liz
So I'm just going to go and I want to share my screen one more time and I'm going to pull this up. Let me see if you can see this. Let me move that out of the way. OK, so this is my home page and I want to use this as an example because my copy. Obviously, I'm a copywriter is very strong, I have a very strong personality, and the way that you say something is not the way I'm going to say it.

[00:13:25.620] - Liz
So as you're using a swipe file, let's say you screenshot capture my whole homepage, you go through and you write and then you're you're uploading it now. You're reading it out loud. So this the headline, raise your hand if you've ever paid for a month of email but never sent out a damn one. Maybe you don't say damn. So you cross that out. Don't fret, babe. You aren't the first one and you ain't going to be the last.

[00:13:52.770] - Liz
So if you're a more formal person or let's say, you know, you're a crochet blogger talking to moms, you could say like instead of don't fret, you might say, don't worry, my friend, instead of babe or mama or whatever. And you know, you aren't the only one. Instead of you aren't the first and you ain't going to be the last or you aren't the first, and you're definitely not going to be the last. And so just go through and read it out loud and ask yourself, would I really say this.

[00:14:26.400] - Liz
So I'm going to read this out loud and you tell me if it sounds natural. You've known me, what, 15 minutes, but it says, raise your hand if you've ever paid for a month of email but never sent out a damn one. Don't fret babe. You aren't the first and you ain't going to be the last. But I do want you to knock that crap off. That sounds just like me. So as you go through your copy, that's what I want you to do.

[00:14:48.690] - Liz
The last step after you've used a swipe file, don't write from scratch. It's too hard use a swipe file. Number two write it on paper first? Because you are going to stop all that self editing when you are manually putting each letter down. And number three, when you do get it ready to go that final step, all you got to do is read it out loud. Ask yourself would I really say this? You know would I really say ""don't fret."" Like, does that sound like me or is that just what Liz wrote? And I'm writing it?

[00:15:22.050] - Liz
Don't I normally say, don't worry instead, something like that. I hope that helps. And last like I said, this recording, I wanted it to be super quick, very simple. If you know one thing about me, it's that I love myself and I don't like to work too hard. So I wanted to make this as simple as possible for you and put it in the simplest terms.

[00:15:46.470] - Liz
I started out as a blogger. I used to have a RV blog. I used to travel around the country and share my journey with people. But when you live in an RV with a three year old, two hundred square feet, limited Internet, you've got to make things simple. So this is how I did, how I started writing my copy. And so this is the simplest way and I want you to have it.

[00:16:13.650] - Liz
But if you're if you're ready to get started with swipe files, ding, let me show you what I'm bringing to the table. Let me just exit out so you can see this. You don't need to see my face everywhere. So this is my swipe file. What you're going to get is a welcome sequence. So these are mainly email swipe files, which that's my expertise. I already showed you how to get, make swipe files for sales pages and stuff with that screen capture.

[00:16:46.230] - Liz
But if you really want to get started writing your own copy, I suggest doing it in email because email marketing has the highest ROI and that's how you're really going to get to know people and show people who you are and where you're coming from. So I'm going to give you a welcome sequence, which I showed you right here. And then you're also going to get three newsletter examples and fifty two subject lines. Let me show you these subject lines and I can... These fifty two subject lines have gotten me over forty percent open rate for every one of them.

[00:17:24.060] - Liz
And you can already see I put X, Y, Z. So if you're a crochet blogger do you have any questions about crocheting. If you know, if you blog about boy bands, why do you hate Backstreet Boys. If you are blogging about writing resumes, help my or indeed.Com is killing my soul, something like that. And so you can just take these. Like I said, don't ever write anything from scratch. Use a swipe file.

[00:17:55.620] - Liz
These subject lines are really going to get you going and give you lots of ideas on how to write your copy and what to write. So I hope that helps. I am so honored to be a part of your copy writing and blogging journey now. So just click the link below and get that freebie and get started. And to wrap it all up, remember, this is just three ways you can write your own copy. And number one, use a swipe file, let me pull that up, number two write it on paper first so you stop all that self editing.

[00:18:33.900] - Liz
And number three, ask yourself would I really say this. And if not, then, you know, that's when you need to start editing and changing things up from the swipe file. All right. I hope you have a great week here at the Summit and I'll see you soon.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.550] - Nataliya
Thank you very much for the introduction. Everybody welcome. For the next 30 minutes, we'll be focusing on Funnels. But before we dive in, let's take care of a couple of things. One, questions, please write them in the chat. Make sure you see that on the right hand side and feel free.

[00:00:29.940] - Nataliya
While we are on the slide session, I'll be able to answer them. If you're watching this and replay, you can jump on my website Housegravity.com and use the bubble chat to ask your questions. And if you pick up the material that comes with this session, you also will be able to see my email and feel free to email me with that. The second item that we do before we want to start is make sure you let me know where you are on the journey, right is zero.

[00:01:03.420] - Nataliya
Just enter zero into the chat. If you are starting from scratch, you know that you want to do set up funnels, but you are just starting the journey. And for one, if you have already gotten a feel for it before, so zero or one, let's see where everybody is. Let me start with this question in the context of blogging. So, what are funnels all about?

[00:01:30.330] - Nataliya
And just like the definition of funnels, I like to explain to my clients that funnels are indeed a representation, a visual of that journey that a customer takes on the way to a sale. The customer is the hero of the story. We focus on them and their experience as we design them, every step and every touch point on that journey. What visuals are common for us to imagine from the work funnel, there comes that visual of the funnel. Indeed, it starts with the top of the funnel where we are reaching the masses.

[00:02:10.180] - Nataliya
People are starting to find out information that we deliver on our wonderful blog. They become solid partners. They come and visit. They read all of our blogs, they sign up for emails and read all of the emails we wish. And then the bottom of the funnel is those trusted customers that will buy everything that we have created with the mind on them.

[00:02:35.400] - Nataliya
Usually, the sales funnel ends with that sales decision, and rarely you will find additional steps and descriptions for that. But that's quite common. You might also have seen the McKinsey customer journey. This is more fluid. You see that there is more action kind of and repeat action that takes into account, the experience that person gets after they go through the purchase.

[00:03:02.440] - Nataliya
How was their experience with your product? And when they're triggered by another pain point, will they come back to make another purchase from you? And also like in this example, that shortcut of a loyalty loop. They don't have to go around the long path of collecting more information, finding competitors, comparing functionality, figuring out more about the brand. They have this direct line back to you because they trust you.

[00:03:34.240] - Nataliya
And also this becomes key when somebody's pain can be answered by me as a friend who's recommending and then trusting me as a source to shortcut and write on this loyalty loop. Because I have already made this journey. What I see a lot around funnels two issues that I would like to, two observations that I would like to share with you is that one in effective setup. I see that a lot when people start off on their blogging journey and I agree there is a lot to get done.

[00:04:11.650] - Nataliya
Just optimizing the website for the experience on both mobile and desktop can take a lot of effort. The copywriting, getting your message right, it is a lot of work. I feel it, I know it and I completely understand. And as you are building your base for a very solid foundation for people to understand your customers, to understand where they're coming from.

[00:04:37.590] - Nataliya
I encourage you to add Google Analytics as a focal point in the beginning of the journey. Study utms, that whole concept of what they are. And as a quick explanation, it is additional code that gets added to your naked link by naked link. I mean yourblog.com or the relevant keywords that you use for your blog post. Right? If you just post that link everywhere you are represented on social media and in emails, people will click.

[00:05:15.830] - Nataliya
You will see that if you're using anything at all, even your hosts will be able to tell you that people are coming to your website, but without those utms, additional info. Basically, it says this link was shared on Facebook and it's related to this campaign that I'm running. This link, the same link, now this link I shared on Instagram and it was related to this thought that I had for the campaign. Unless you use those additional words to attach to your link, you will not be able to optimize Google Analytics to give you the sources of how people arrive to your website.

[00:05:57.080] - Nataliya
What did they click to get there?

[00:05:59.380] - Nataliya
So, make sure you dive into it. If you need help, reach out to me. I'll share the resources that I use. I have a spreadsheet I can recommend and I will actually list all of that. So, you don't have to do it.

[00:06:14.780] - Nataliya
More energy and social platform pixels. They're still around. They're still relevant. They're more connected to your ad activity when you're ready to advertise or create ad campaigns, but it's very helpful if you start pixelating your site right away. People who come and visit, those cookies will be connected to the Pixel and they'll be able to link back.

[00:06:38.580] - Nataliya
Next time you run an ad campaign, you will be able to lean on those pixels to say that these guys liked it. Let's use more of the same type of customer to reach your ads. And the second observation that I have is that people are burning out too quickly on funnels. They may exert and they do exert so much input into creating a test. Even if it's something that you're putting up for sale at a fraction of the cost to see.

[00:07:14.980] - Nataliya
To test your audience. To test those visitors that are more loyal to your writing, it still might feel very disheartening when there are no sales or very few sales. If you're investing too much money on the ad spend that can also tip your boat where you are feeding Facebook instead of your family doing these. And throwing in the towel too early, just trying creating one test run of the funnel and saying, whoa, this is not for me. I'm just going to blog and that's it.

[00:07:53.230] - Nataliya
We're missing the point if we do it. The point is that funnels and creating funnels is a marathon. Things change, people's attention, kind of so, by following that collecting input, you will be able to reiterate, pivot, combine, recreate, come up with fresh ideas if you stay at it. Build the foundation if you're just starting out for everybody who enters zeros, if you're just starting out, building that good foundation, laying at it solid, creating what your KPIs are and then moving on with that. Let's continue.

[00:08:35.660] - Nataliya
This is a diagram that I create for my clients when we talk about creating a funnel for them, right? I like to invert it and present it as a pyramid because that represents all the effort it will take to roll up, the efforts of getting strangers to come and visit your website. Their attention splits after 3 seconds and all of their run. So, we have to bring additional ones, fresh eyes, fresh set of eyes. Get them to be visitors, get their emails, make sure that they're not burner emails or if there are burner emails, that's fine too.

[00:09:16.430] - Nataliya
People are testing people have those tools as well. So, on the visitor side, there's a little bit of scrubbing of your email list, maybe verifying emails and then making sure that you deliver to those visitors, the people that trust you. Let's build the trust. Let's deepen the trust in order for them to be customers quicker when you are ready.

[00:09:39.290] - Nataliya
It might be that strangers and visitors might be your focus and there is plenty to do there before you arrive to customers. But as soon as you have a customer, start thinking of the repeat customer, or even at the process of creating customers with your first thinking, what could you lead them to become repeat customers again? And the point is that we're driving to that super set of fans, people who keep purchasing from you, who follow you as you navigate the topic that you are writing about and that keeps getting valuable information from you.

[00:10:20.980] - Nataliya
Valuable resources, products that by the end of that experience they're saying like, whoa, he or she is awesome. I'm going to recommend them on every stop.

[00:10:34.700] - Nataliya
So that is our goal. From here, let's look closer at each stage and this is where my challenge to you comes in. I would like to invite you to kindly recreate these stages for yourself. You can go analog and use sticky notes. You will need 100 of them.

[00:10:56.910] - Nataliya
You can use your systems that you use for your project management, whether it's Trello it's, Click Up anything. But in each stage, I want you to identify 20 tactics for your blog that will help you deliver the content that strangers are looking for, that visitors are looking for. Additional 24 visitors, additional 24 customers. What tactics would help you keep them on repeat? What tactics, are there 20 things that you can do for those super fans of yours to help them promote your products best for you.

[00:11:39.680] - Nataliya
Don't stop until you get 20. They might not be relevant in their entirety. They might not fit on the same timeline. You would not be able to do all of them in the same quarter, same year. But it could be your treasure chest for the times when you are stuck.

[00:11:57.630] - Nataliya
When you feel like I'm about to give up on my dream, you can look back and say, oh, you know what, this tactic. I saw it somewhere. I saw how it was implemented. I would like to try it as well.

[00:12:08.580] - Nataliya
Let me lay it out into action points for the next three weeks and see how to test that out. Just like you would do with any of your sticky notes. You can look at your whole wall filled with your sticky notes of all of the tactics that you could try and start aggregating them, kind of filtering them out. Which ones would make sense this year? Which ones could just because of the effort, maybe push them out into next year?

[00:12:43.530] - Nataliya
Some, maybe they're not applicable now, but it might be worth keeping them in your Rolodex because they might trigger additional ideas for tactics that are kind of related to them. So, go through. Once you're done with that, you should be able to have a wall of tactics that you have identified. This will be my friends for these twelve months or eleven months because we are already into the new year, correct. And now your goal is to commit.

[00:13:17.380] - Nataliya
You're going to show your visitors and people who are just taking a peek at you that there is a track record of you delivering those blogs weekly. You're delivering on your Facebook lives or be it in Instagram lives. You have a series of interviews. You have email campaigns that are regular. People see your ads, maybe if you decide to start retargeting them, if they visit your website, they see an ad next day that creates a little bit of, oh, she means business.

[00:13:48.620] - Nataliya
She is serious about this. And once you have that, you have a plan. So, there's your how to. But I ask you not to skip that ideation stage. Each stage, give yourself 20 ideas each.

[00:14:06.420] - Nataliya
And don't stop there. Now let's go into where do we start? And I want to start talking about the customers. A lot of times we will start imagining that user persona. We will have an image, their age range, their interest, their height, all things that a lot of times don't impact the sale process.

[00:14:31.820] - Nataliya
So, instead, I would like to ask you if you're familiar with the concept of jobs to be done. This comes from a product design world. Jobs to be done where we are tracking the jobs that our customers are trying to get done and we are providing a solution. We're taking them on the process. We are taking out all the effort from figuring out how to do something.

[00:15:00.930] - Nataliya
We are taking them from zero to one.

[00:15:05.710] - Nataliya
So, let me give you an example. I subscribe to Netflix, but I don't watch it as much. I use it to let my child focus when I need to create a video or when I have a client call. And what I noticed is Netflix is doing is every couple of weeks, or maybe once a month, they will send me an email, and I need to correlate if it's tied to the day when the subscription renews or not. That will be an interesting view, but that email contains the three main topics of themes based on my child's choice of cartoons that she watches, so it can be adventure, adventurers, brave, and something else.

[00:15:57.310] - Nataliya
Additional videos that you could watch that you might like in the same vein. But the third item is a statement that my child really enjoys Miraculous Ladybug. So, here is the print out for her to color. Now think about that. Their job is to share videos with us.

[00:16:17.800] - Nataliya
But Netflix is doing a job for me. What is my job here? My job is not to give her videos to watch, and I want her to understand videos on how it works. I'm trying to entertain her and entertain her with some well curated material. So I'm choosing Netflix that I pay for over a YouTube channel whose quality I might not trust as much.

[00:16:45.590] - Nataliya
But I'm making a conscious choice and I'm willing to pay for it. But catch that idea that Netflix is doing. They understand my job and they're helping me deliver on my job better. They want me to give my child something else to do that might be connected with that video, but it's not a video. It's a coloring page.

[00:17:07.570] - Nataliya
They are focusing on who I am in this space. Let's talk about you would have been a couple of purchases that you made lately that you were trying to get the job done. What I'm thinking, how this can be easily transact to purchasing a Roomba, for example, instead of all the time it would take you to remind yourself to clean the floors, do that, and then how much time it will save you that room by taking away your job and giving you time to focus on something else.

[00:17:46.030] - Nataliya
My example is that a year ago I wanted to provide my family with healthy dinners every day, but I did not want to cook every day. So, I realized that I could add frozen meals to the mix.

[00:18:02.230] - Nataliya
I needed a resource that one could give me good quality recipes, but the ones that my family would like and that would also cook with healthy ingredients. And I didn't want them to be super processed, so that became quite a journey. So, my search intent was very specific, and I was able to come up with a couple blogs that wrote on this topic. One did not fit my criteria because the recipes that were offered were a little bit too heavy for the palette of a toddler, would have been perfect for adults, but I found one that was more family oriented, and the recipes that were available for free were something for me to try.

[00:18:47.730] - Nataliya
So, I subscribed.

[00:18:48.970] - Nataliya
I tested, and then I quickly came back to make a purchase on a bundle. And I am willing to be a repeat customer because it was so successful and so well received by my family that it met my social requirement of being a good mother. I was able to please my immediate family members. And so, each job that you are considering, what are the jobs around which I am writing about on my blog but would also help my customer grow from this point to this point? Where are they trying to cross and do? And then look into three areas the economic where they are considering your proposal over something else that somebody else might be doing that is similar.

[00:19:41.590] - Nataliya
Consider the emotional aspect of how do they want to feel and how do they feel if they don't make that progress? And then, of course, the social or are they trying to be?

[00:19:53.310] - Nataliya
What is behind that job? Just like for me, frozen meals was not as much about cooking and the skills around cooking ability, but to be a good mom for my kids. Alright. So, I have another sets of, I have covered all of these questions, how the emotions are getting affected.

[00:20:25.820] - Nataliya
What are some social pressures that the customer feels that makes them want to do something or not or consider your product or not? And of course, what value that will help you create, copy and deliver and connect? And also what are the customers desired outcomes? So, let's look at the jobs. Here is my second challenge to you.

[00:20:51.690] - Nataliya
After you have written 20 tactics in each of the stages, I would like for you to start noticing jobs. Start with yourself. So, go through those last three purchases you made and try to map them. What job, can you identify the job that you are trying to fill? Is there something that you fired to get the job done? For me.

[00:21:13.150] - Nataliya
It was software that I stopped using because I have moved everything into Notion. So, I was able to get rid of some of the project management tools that I was paying for, and notion took its place. Start with jobs and outcomes. What outcomes were you looking for when you were making that purchasing decision on those last three purchases? And then because you know yourself so well, you can hopefully identify the pain point that is connected to that purchase and consider where there are functional nuances.

[00:21:49.790] - Nataliya
Are there social attributes that help you make the decision where they are emotional and again, financial as well? And 100 jobs, you can do it. Start and don't leave the table for at least 25 minutes, said the Pomodoro. Ask everybody to give you those 25 minutes and just focus on your niche where you write, what are some outcomes that people would be looking for and the jobs that you can start testing? This will become.

[00:22:24.910] - Nataliya
Now you have a set of tactics that you can kind of lean into, and now you have a set of 100 ideas that you can pick through and see which ones, and you can map them. How much, based on effort, which one would require more effort to deliver to a customer, which one have less? And then as you're getting feedback on your materials as you're sharing them, as you're connecting your product features with some things that you are given away for free through guides to people who subscribe, can you create that sense of you're giving away a lot more. And then not the most applicable

[00:23:11.650] - Nataliya

[00:00:09.150] - Portia Wofford, thewritenurse.com
Hey Everyone, I'm going to share my screen and we're going to get started, OK? Today we're going to talk about five copywriting mistakes that are killing your conversions, right. I know that as a blogger or even if you don't have your own blog and you're blogging for someone else, the conversion rates mean everything. Conversion rates, you know, are how you get or how you're getting paid. How your client's getting paid so that means everything. And engagement has a lot to do with it with conversion.

[00:00:38.310] - Portia
Right. So let's talk about your audience doesn't engage with you. You can follow me on Facebook @PortiaWofford on Twitter and Instagram at @thewritenurse. My goal for you is for you to understand how to use the power of words to gain more likes, shares, subscribers, or clients. Immediately stand out from the crowd and establish authority in your niche. You're in the perfect place because this is a no fluff zone. You're going to get actionable steps and tips that you can apply immediately.

[00:01:15.210] - Portia
You're going to get proven copywriting methods I've used time and time again. To write high converting, highly engaging content that's been seen, read, shared and liked by tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands of people.

[00:01:33.360] - Portia
This is for you, if you're a blogger or writer who wants more clicks, greater subscribers or engagement, is struggling with finding the right words to say, you're absolutely done with no leads and no clients and ready to quickly apply tips to take your copy from bla to your readers saying ""I can't take my eyes off of this."" And you're ready to position yourself to make a huge difference in your tribe's lives. I am Portia Wofford, I'm a nurse, a writer and marketing pro.

[00:02:09.670] - Portia
I'm the founder of the PWagency, which is a content marketing firm, and this is why you should listen to me. I'm a self-taught copywriter, when my teachers told me to use my words, I turned them into an entire exhibit in the middle school library. That's a very true story. I discovered I had a knack for connecting people to my words when I won my first for a speaking contest in fourth grade. I have 10 plus years as a nurse.

[00:02:36.350] - Portia
Learn how to untangle healthcare and medical terminology, terminology to drastically decrease my patients rehospitalization rate and educate entire nursing departments. I've written engaging and high performing content for various platforms, and I help health care brands grow with the power of words. But most importantly, I am a roll tide yelling girl from Alabama. So roll tide, roll. If we have any University of Alabama fans out there. So let's get down to the nitty gritty of copyrighting mistakes before we get started. I want to make sure that we're on the same page as far as writing is concerned.

[00:03:15.970] - Portia
Copywriting of course, we know it uses emotion and human psychology to connect and Convert with readers. But for bloggers and writers, copywriting is about placing your content strategically. You want to persuade readers to trust you, engage with you or follow a call to action. Number one [mistake], you don't know your keywords, you have to start with the keyword research, you have to ask yourself, what are my readers Googling? If you are writing for other clients, if you're a blogger who blogs for your clients, you need to ask yourself what are my clients or readers, Googling. Keyword research helps you spend time making content that focuses on those words or phrases will deliver for your most targeted prospect.

[00:04:02.540] - Portia
When you target specific words and phrases. You have a better chance of ranking higher on Google, Yahoo, Bing whatever search engine you're trying to write for, for content that includes those words and phrases. You're going to think of keywords and keyword phrases as clues. You want to make sure that you use keywords in the title or the headline of your piece. Also use in the first paragraph of the piece if you're writing, in just a few words your, the search engines will be able to tell what your piece is about.

[00:04:31.970] - Portia
And what happens is that they see certain key words or phrases and whether, you know, when they're crawling or they're crawling and indexing, say, hey, you know, she's writing about X, Y and Z. I've seen this before. People are searching. They've let me put this up a little higher in the search engine. You can write tons of amazing content, I want I want you to hone in on this, right, tons of amazing content.

[00:04:57.870] - Portia
You can be the best in the world, but if it's not optimized to write for terms that your target audience or your target reader is searching for then no one is going to read it. No one is going to find it. So make sure you take some time to research what terms you want to be high for, research work, what keywords or phrases people are searching for.

[00:05:25.330] - Portia
[mistake] Number two, you're talking about or to yourself too much, to be blunt here, it's not about you.

[00:05:34.090] - Portia
Everything is not about you. It's about your reader, your readers voice. We tend to use our own terms and terminology and lingo when we're writing, especially if we had another vision before we became bloggers or writers. So like me, I'm a nurse. A lot of my clients are nurses or healthcare entrepreneurs and they tend to write or talk the same way that they would talk if they were talking to your colleague. But those people are not their ideal client, so they can't write in that same voice.

[00:06:04.330] - Portia
You need to write in a way your reader can understand. Use everyday speak. Make sure your copy is conversational to your reader. Use the word ""you"" don't write too much about ""I"" or ""we"" in your content.

[00:06:18.260] - Portia
Make sure that you're speaking the language that they speak, if they use contractions when when they write. OK, you might want to consider using contractions when you speak, when you write. If they use the ""but"" and ""and"" at the beginning of a sentence, that they use ellipses, it's OK to use all of these things. Just make sure that you use their language, their phrases, and not yours.

[00:06:45.450] - Portia
This is Calandra, Calandra is a mathematician and she has a company where she tutors kids all the way from pre-k to college students to a graduate level student, anything about math,  you need to know anything about math? She can help you. She has a master's degree in math and mathematics, when Calandra came to me. She was using a lot of content that she would use if she were speaking to another master's prepared mathematician. It was not optimized for her ideal client and she was not getting conversion, which was not converting. So we optimize her content. We changed the language a little bit. We wrote some flyers and some blog posts and within three days of, the first day alone, she got 5 appointments scheduled and a week later she had eight sessions within three local cities.

[00:07:35.760] - Portia
All we did was changed the way she talked. Just change the tone. We make sure that we use her ideal client's language.

[00:07:45.810] - Portia
[mistake] Number three, you're not targeting your readers pain point or problems. No one cares about you. Everybody wants to know about the benefits of the product or service you are offering. How are you helping the reader? You need to address them. Answer their questions. Make sure that you keep an individual person in mind when you're writing, because if you're writing for one person, you're talking to one person you, write for one person, you're solving one person's problem.

[00:08:16.070] - Portia
Keep it individualized and then convert, convince and convert to tell a story. You're going to build a relationship. You're going to push yourself and the reader too. These people want to know that you can stop, solve their problem, they want to know what they're going to get out of reading your blog, what they're going to get out of reading this article. They're going to get out of this blog post, that's beneficial to them.

[00:08:46.110] - Portia
[mistake] Number four your structure is off, structure is so important, it makes things easier to read.

[00:08:51.510] - Portia
It breaks it up because we all know that people have short attention spans so it breaks that keep your attention on the article, on the blog post, on the page you're going to use bullets. You can make your style consistent. How do you make yourself consistent? You're going to style how your bullets make sure that your bullets match the pre-frame of the bullet. So in other words, if you started with, you're about to learn, if each bullet needs to be readable, whether it be consistent with your bullet punctuation. Some bullets end in punctuation, some don't. It's your preference however you want to do it but just be consistent [inaudible 00:09:27] however you start is how you need to finish.

[00:09:29.700] - Portia
Make sure that your indentation and spacing is consistent throughout. Use white space, don't use choppy long sentences, break sentences up into two, three or four, if you can, if have to, it's OK to use broken in one word sentences, if that's how your reader talks. If that's optimize to your reader, your client. That's fine. Use headlines and subheadlines these are the same things as header tags. Use active and passive voice when your reader is reading. They should be able to get the sense of what your whole blog is about just by reading your subheads.

[00:10:07.150] - Portia
While most readers probably won't notice that you have misstyling, almost all your readers will notice if you have bad style, or inconsistent style and so make sure that you're consistent with your structure, that you're consistent with your style throughout. And this is a little, you know, kind of like a little white space here to kind of break it up, make sure that everyone is still with me, I still have everyone's attention.

[00:10:32.660] - Portia
[mistake] Number five, your copy is hard to read, readability is important, readability is the ease with which a reader can understand your text. In the United States the average readability score is a seven/eighth grade level. So most people are comfortable reading text that is understood by 11 to 13 year olds. Here are some tools that you can use the common readability score. You simply copy paste your text into these tools and it will give you your readability score.

[00:11:01.680] - Portia
Good copy builds trust and improves your brand recognition, establishes a strong brand identity, helps influence conversions, optimize content, helps improve your SEO. And we know SEO is important for ranking, is important for making sure you rank higher and faster on those search engines and copy increases engagement and visibility, which equals more leads, which equals more clients, which equals more money in your wallet.

[00:11:27.450] - Portia
And good copy just simply proves that you have the secret sauce. So how does a blog or blog post convert? Step one, people search for answers that go into a search engine, they type in keywords, phrases, and questions. Number two your blog or your blog post answers the questions. Number three, the reader wants the solution because they understand that you answered the question, so how, does content become money? Your content sends the reader to a website where the solution is offered. So if you are a blogger and you have a lot of affiliate partnerships, you want to make sure you're optimizing because you want to take advantage of this.

[00:12:06.360] - Portia
Number two, you properly identify the problem, and since you properly identified the problem for reader and you have the answer as well. You know, they have this problem. So, hey, is a possibility that you can have the solution to the problem. Number three, a blogger, a post has easy to follow calls to action. You tell them exactly what to do next. Click here. If you want to learn more, click here. If you want to buy x, y, z.  Schedule your call here, schedule your discovery call here, you make it easy, it's laid out in black and white ABC one, two, three it's easy to understand. There's no confusion about it at all.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.520] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm really excited for the session with Ryan Turner of Amplifi Strategy. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate you taking the time.

[00:00:17.840] - Ryan Turner, amplifistrategy.com
Thank you for the invitation. It's my pleasure.

[00:00:20.870] - Liz
It was great when you pitched your topic on funnel marketing and decided to talk about the mistakes people make with their funnels and whatnot. Can you give anyone who doesn't know you a little bit of information on your background and then we'll dive into all the good stuff?

[00:00:36.800] - Ryan
I'm an American that lives abroad. I'm from Atlanta, born and raised, but live in Madrid, Spain. I've been here since 2005 and love it. I did have a three-year stint in Milan, Italy, from 2006 to 2019, ended up hating it. Moved back to Madrid with my family where I live happily, and it's also where I started my business.

[00:00:53.930] - Ryan
I have a funnel agency. I like to call it a FaaS agency, a funnels as a service agency, and I help course creators, consultants, coaches create marketing funnels to help online businesses or their businesses scale leads and scale their sales quickly.

[00:01:16.070] - Ryan
I do that with full funnel service. I help them with paid advertising. I also help them with educating their leads through nurture funnels or through educational funnel. I also help them with sales funnels. So the full aspect of what funnels is, which is lead generation, education, and then conversion is where I help them. 

[00:01:38.990] - Ryan
I even help them with creating their courses and organizing them to deliver to their clients.

[00:01:46.370] - Liz
Fantastic. I know when I started blogging it was like have a lead magnet. But then there was no information, like, now I have this list that costs me money. And I think I was I'm not alone in that. People just starting still have that issue sometimes.

[00:02:03.380] - Liz
You've kind of covered the basis of a funnel: lead, education, conversion. But you recommend starting with what the conversion experience is going to be like. Is that accurate to say?

[00:02:17.430] - Ryan
Well, it really depends on what your goal is. If I can recommend anything to anybody that's just getting into funnels, it's have a clear goal. Having a funnel is not going to change your business if you don't have a business idea or a business that's functional.  You're going to want to make sure that you have an objective in mind.

[00:02:35.340] - Ryan
Like I mentioned, there's three components of funnel marketing. When we create funnels, we are either generating leads or generating prospects that are going to be open to possibly purchasing from us. That's the first stage of the funnel.

[00:02:53.430] - Ryan
The second stage of the funnel is educating those leads so that they're open and can gain the trust to actually purchase from us. Then the third part of the funnel is that part where they actually say, ""Okay, here's my money. Please, change my life.""

[00:03:08.220] - Ryan
 When we create a funnel, oftentimes we're using one or two components of those types of funnels, and we'll think of that whole thing as a funnel. But it's really important that you understand what you need.

[00:03:21.600] - Ryan
It makes no sense if you have no leads and no email list or any type of person to sell to, to start to implement some type of strategy called funnel or funnel that's designed to educate leads if you have no leads coming in.

[00:03:36.780] - Ryan
So you're going to want to have a lead generation funnel if you don't already have some type of large list, if you don't have a large following, if you're not an influencer, if you're not huge on Instagram or whatever your platform is of preference. You're going to need a way to actually get leads into your business and convert them.

[00:03:58.670] - Liz
What do you convert them to, though? Because I feel like most of the bloggers have some sort of lead generation or they know they're working on setting it up because, ""You need an email list, you need people to sign up,"" that is shouted from the rooftops all over the place. But then they end up paying for an email marketing list that they don't know how to make money from. So how do they take their lists and funnel them to make money?

[00:04:26.550] - Ryan
Again, ask the important questions. Who are you catering to with your business or with your blog in this case? Who are you catering to?  Why are you even in this Summit? Are you in this Summit because you want to write better or are you in this Summit because you want to actually make a business out of your blog?

[00:04:44.940] - Ryan
Some people are passion bloggers and some people could care less about trying to scale up that. And even though they might tell themselves that they want to make a business out of it, I know some people just aren't in a position to say, ""Okay, I'm not going to do this just for passion."" You should do something for passion.

[00:05:03.450] - Liz
You should passionate about your business.

[00:05:06.900] - Ryan
Exactly. But that's the thing that you need to understand. If you have made the decision that with this project, with this blog you want to make money, then you need to make a decision that you will make money. That's the part where people start to get wishy-washy, ""Well, maybe I will, maybe I won't."" Will you or will you not?

[00:05:33.490] - Ryan
It's like Yoda in Star Wars, what he said to Skywalker when he was trying to lift up the space ship out of the swamp. He's like, ""Master Yoda, I'm trying."" And he said, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" And that's the same thing. You need to make the decision. It's not that you're not trying or anything. You need to make a decision.

[00:06:01.420] - Ryan
If you've decided that you're going to have a blog that's going to be monetized, then you need to start thinking in terms of a business and not just of passion writing.

[00:06:11.800] - Liz
Sure. Once that decision's been made...

[00:06:14.290] - Ryan
And I forgot your original question, which was how do they...?

[00:06:21.250] - Liz
Take their leads and convert them to make money? How do they figure out what to sell them, whether it's affiliate links or whether it's a product they've created? What do you need to start with? You need to start with a goal in mind and then work backwards.

[00:06:36.010] - Ryan
Well, like I said, the decision is definitely first that you want to make money. If you decide you want to make money, we can just call that, okay, you've got a business idea now. Now, you need to decide, how are you going to help the people that are reading you?

[00:06:56.050] - Ryan
Okay, they're reading your content. Okay, they like what you write. Now, how can you make their life better with something that they could pay you for? Is that a service or is that offering something through your blog that they're willing to pay for that maybe it's not your service, maybe it's some type of product that you can monetize?

[00:07:19.630] - Ryan
You need to understand your readers and understand your audience. If you don't understand them, you need to make the effort to try to understand what they're willing to pay for. A business is comprised of a product or service to sell. And if you don't really have a product or a service in mind, you need to think of one.

[00:07:42.460] - Ryan
It gets convoluted sometimes with certain people that are interested in my services because they think that because they're working with me, I'm going to somehow have some magic pill for them about what their product or service should be. And that's something that is a business owner's prime objective.

[00:08:02.230] - Ryan
I can't really offer much help. You need to be able to at least think of how you can help people. You need to think of an ""I help statement"", for example, ""I help people do this through my blog."" That will at least get your mind focused in the right direction.

[00:08:23.530] - Ryan
Copyblogger, I don't know if you've ever heard of them. They're amazing. That's like the perfect example of a blogger that decided he was going to make a living and a business out of his actual blog and they say it, ""Words that work for smarter digital marketing and sales."" That's what they say when you land on their website.

[00:08:49.550] - Ryan
So they're clear with their messaging and they know how they want to help people. They're helping you with your words for marketing.

[00:08:57.380] - Liz
Right. So before you're diving into setting up your funnel or coming up with your goal, you need to do some market research. And sometimes it's sending a survey to your list if you have a list.  Send them a survey, say, ""Hey, what are you struggling with? What would you like to see me do?"" You may not get a ton of response, but you'll get something. That'll give you some place to start for sure.

[00:09:21.650] - Ryan
Absolutely. You definitely need to get some type of market feedback. Now, depending on how close you are with your audience, if you're engaging with them, if they engage with you either through Instagram or through the comments section of your blog, or if you have a vlog and they send you blogged responses or video responses. You need to have a feel of that.

[00:09:45.860] - Ryan
You need to know what makes them tick, what makes them respond to you. And if you are able to identify that, you've got a leg up and you are in a very good position to begin to develop something that will resonate. Because if you can't resonate with your audience, then it doesn't really matter what you sell.

[00:10:05.330] - Ryan
In order for someone to sell, it doesn't mean you have to be the best at something. It means they have to trust you. No one's going to buy anything from anybody unless they know that it's going to be a safe purchase. That's how people make purchases. You need to get to that point. And to get to that point, it's recognizing all those things.

[00:10:23.510] - Liz
Yes. So we've talked about having a clear goal, having a clear message that you know where you're going. Before we started recording, you talked about how people get into this marketing cycle of not providing the right content and just focusing on the marketing as opposed to the rest of it. How do people stop that?

[00:10:50.050] - Ryan
Well, I think with regards to bloggers, well, they've got this blog and it's got great content and they're worried about possibly sounding salesy. They don't want to use things like paper click ads on their blog because it ends up being clickbaity.

[00:11:11.290] - Ryan
When you start thinking about money and you start thinking about advertising and start thinking about all these things, lots of negative energy comes into your mind. So the first thing that you should probably think, this is a presentation on funnels, I'm a funnel marketer, is to think of what a funnel is.

[00:11:30.520] - Ryan
I just mentioned Copyblogger because I really like what they do and they're using funnels constantly. But you never feel like you're being pitched at. You feel like they're always offering value.  And what I like to tell people and I usually make this analogy is to think of your customers or your audience coming to you and walking into IKEA. You need to be IKEA; you don't want to be Dollar General.

[00:12:02.190] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:03.790] - Ryan
Now, both General and IKEA sell a lot of the same stuff. They sell a lot of the same quality stuff from the same places of origin. Probably many of the products that they sell come possibly from the same factories. But what gives you a sense of more satisfaction or fulfillment when you walk into the store? Walking into IKEA or walking into Dollar General?

[00:12:31.030] - Ryan
Most people would say IKEA. IKEA does something, even though they sell lots of the same products besides the furniture. Obviously, Dollar General and dollar stores, they don't sell lots of furniture, but they sell plates and...

[00:12:42.130] - Liz
When you walk into IKEA, you see all the pretty stuff, you see what's possible, and then you start to make your list of ideas and what works. And then it's not till the very end that you can go pick out the stuff to buy.

[00:12:56.160] - Ryan
Exactly. This is exactly it. It's not that you have something to offer, it's that you're showing the benefit of using what it is that you can offer. Like suction cups. You're not going to go to Dollar General and be like, ""I need a toothbrush,"" and then pass a suction cup on some other aisle and be like, ""Oh, a suction cup. Let me get that suction cup even though I'm here for a toothbrush.""

[00:13:22.920] - Ryan
You don't do that. Yet at IKEA, guess what? You will go to IKEA and be like, ""I need the extra credenza for my foyer."" And by the time you get the credenza and you get to the checkout, look at your basket. What do you have? You might have some suction cups in there.

[00:13:43.660] - Ryan
You didn't go into IKEA to get some suction cups, but IKEA did something that the dollar store did not. What they did is demonstrate value. They don't just put some suction cups on a rack. You passed a display that had a little toothbrush holder...

[00:13:59.980] - Liz
Get some ways to use it, ideas. Yeah.

[00:14:01.660] - Ryan
Right. Yeah, exactly. They showed you how you can use this and apply this in your home. And then they did something else. They have a call to action. So it's not like they're just showing you how beautiful this suction cup is holding up this little toothbrush holder. They're actually showing you how it applies to your life. And then they say, ""Look, if this is something that interests you, we happen to have a giant basket of a thousand of them right here.""

[00:14:27.850] - Liz
But you're not going to see them somewhere else in the store.

[00:14:30.280] - Ryan
It's going to be right here, right next to where you saw this really cool message. So they're combining the message, which is, ""This can make your life better. Go ahead, you know you want it."" And they do this constantly. Then you have to go in one direction.

[00:14:47.920] - Ryan
I'm not saying you should have a blog that makes people not be able to click anywhere, but you should be offering these types of calls to action. If you're talking about a training or if you're talking about something in your blog, maybe there's some type of training or some type of product or some type of service that you could mention right there.

[00:15:04.720] - Liz
A case study or some other...

[00:15:06.950] - Ryan
And if you're interested in finding more information about this one thing I was just talking about, click here. Those are lots of things that bloggers, especially in the beginning, might not necessarily do because they feel like it's a little piece of information that's invading their passion or invading their idea flow.

[00:15:24.550] - Ryan
""I can't put that in there. That's sounds salesy or that sounds like I'm trying to pitch something."" And part of that's true, which is why it's important to know that you're in this for the business. You're not in it for the business; you're in it to make a living off of it. You can't live off of passion alone. Passion is not going to pay your bills.

[00:15:43.650] - Liz
Yeah, and part of this Summit, too, is you didn't get into starting a blog to create a lifestyle you wanted to constantly work. You need stuff that works for you and you're not constantly working all hours of the day.

[00:15:59.330] - Liz
I love the IKEA analogy. I've totally had to go back and find the thing in IKEA that I missed somehow, I wrote down where it was, and then describing it and I had to go back. And then the analogy still works, right? Because they're like, ""Well, if they miss it, then they're on the lookout for it the next time it comes around.""

[00:16:16.020] - Ryan
Right. And even if you did miss it, guess what? When you've finished the check out in IKEA, you got some Swedish meatballs waiting for you. It's like they think of these things. And as sinister as it might sound to some people that this might be new information for them...

[00:16:31.500] - Liz
It needs a mindset shift.

[00:16:33.050] - Ryan
Exactly. It requires a mindset shift because IKEA has thought about these things beforehand.

[00:16:41.600] - Liz
I never thought about IKEA being a funnel, but as soon as you said it I was like, ""Oh, yeah.""

[00:16:47.420] - Ryan
It's a funnel and you can only go one direction on that long ass mile.  I mean, you have to go like a kilometer and come back.

[00:16:53.860] - Liz
You can use shortcuts if you know what you want, but you still have to [crosstalk 00:16:56]

[00:16:56.330] - Ryan
If you study the map, there are shortcuts, but you've got to go one direction and that's all by design. It's all by design and you need to be conscious of your design. IKEA knows where they want people to go. And if you don't have an idea of where you want people to go or what you want people to buy or what you want to offer people, then you're lost. You need to have the destination before you can create the path. 

[00:17:21.500] - Liz
Yes. Once you've got your path laid out, do you have to pay for ads to get people in your funnel?

[00:17:28.400] - Ryan
No, you do not. Of course, that will depend on who you are. Do you have a large email list? Do you have a large base of followers that are subscribed to your blog? It really depends. What is certain is that you need to have a handle on it. You don't want to have a blog and be like, ""I don't know if people read or not. I just do it for the passion, bro. Just throwing it out there.""

[00:18:01.310] - Ryan
Okay, but if you want to sell something, then you need to probably have some kind of idea of how much money you probably need to make. If you want to leave your job or if you've already left your job, you know how much money you need to make in order to buy groceries and or do all the stuff that you want to do. And that requires some type of metric.

[00:18:17.520] - Ryan
So before you think about ads or paid advertising, think of what you can do organically. Are there things that you can do organically? But you need to have a path. I mentioned Copyblogger. One of the things that they offer when you land on their website is some type of free training to get better at using copy in a useful way throughout your own marketing efforts. And it's their one call to action when you land on their page.

[00:18:53.910] - Ryan
Now, I'm not saying you have to copy Copyblogger's tactics. But if you have, for example, some type of snitched audience that you know is looking for some type of training or some type of service, offer that somewhere. Because once you know that you can offer it, the mechanics of creating a funnel can help you do that. That's where funnel marketing can help.

[00:19:21.030] - Ryan
We've talked about all this esoteric high level stuff. I know. And people are looking at this and being like, ""Will he just get to the funnel? I want to know, how do I connect the opt in page to the thank you page? And how many sequences and how many emails do I need to create?"" That stuff all will come, but think about what people want. And if they want training, well, then there are several options that you could do.

[00:19:44.010] - Ryan
You could create a special guide that's going to help your users achieve a specific result. And if you want to offer that guide, well, don't just put the guide up and give it away without being able to track where it goes and who downloads it. Put an opt in page there. Put it behind an opt in page so that they have to opt in in order to get it.

[00:20:04.590] - Ryan
And then once they've opted in to get that, then you can use effective email marketing and use those skills that you learned in the Copyblogger training to actually write something effective to begin to create a relationship with people that are receiving those emails. You'll deliver your free product or the great guide that you've created, and now you're beginning to generate leads.

[00:20:28.020] - Ryan
And now you have a system that you can run ads to. You never want to just run ads to a blog. That would be ridiculous, but you could definitely run ads to a specific guide. You could run ads to a specific guide that guides people and helps people and has an opt in. You can retarget, you can do a whole bunch of things that way. But you can start off with doing it organically before you go to...

[00:20:56.490] - Liz
And you can do it without feeling salesy, which is something we already discussed. I do want to mention; we have copywriting and email marketing sessions with this Summit that are fantastic. So just keep it in there. Copyblogger is also great, but just throwing that out there.

[00:21:13.590] - Ryan
I want [inaudible 00:21:14]

[00:21:14.550] - Liz
Okay. I think that takes us to a good place because we are running out of time, where I think you have a guide for everyone attending. Do you want to tell them about it?

[00:21:29.290] - Ryan
Yes. Everyone that's watching this obviously is an attendee, and I'd like to offer this free guide, which is a funnel marketing guide: the five steps that will help you create a funnel. It's got some really actionable items in there. It's short, easily consumed. I think it's like 25, 30 pages and it's available to everyone that's participated in the event. There will be a link somewhere for people to get access to that.

[00:22:05.630] - Liz
Okay. Then you also have something for our pro-pass holders.

[00:22:10.210] - Ryan
Yes. For pro-pass holders, I've got an actual funnel template that will include pages, it will include email sequences, and it will include check out, everything automated. If you're already a member of Kartra, it's actually based on the Kartra system. If you don't have Kartra, you'll still get access to all of these great mock ups.

[00:22:32.750] - Ryan
So you can actually try to model this template in your own system if you're using something like ClickFunnels or WordPress or whatever system you might have. But if you are a Kartra user, you get them imported directly into your account.

[00:22:46.310] - Ryan
I charge like 300 bucks for these usually. So it's a great deal and everything is put together if you're in Kartra. I mean, literally all the sequences. It's a lead magnet funnel. So if you've got something like a guide like what I'm offering and you want a way to effectively deliver that guide to your audience, it's a great way to do that.

[00:23:08.180] - Liz
Okay. So guys, definitely check that out. Definitely, go grab the free guide. You can see he really knows his stuff.

[00:23:13.370] - Ryan
But you got to be a pro-pass member to get that one.

[00:23:15.380] - Liz
Yeah, the pro-pass, you can tell it's definitely worth it. And if you guys have questions, feel free to let me know. I know Ryan's in the chat probably for a couple more minutes. So ask him ask him some questions before he has to go.

[00:23:28.010] - Liz
Ryan, thank you so much. I appreciate you walking us through where people get tripped up with funnels and how they can do better. Thank you.

[00:23:35.810] - Ryan
I appreciate the invitation. I appreciate everyone's time that's joining us and best of luck to your funnels. If you need any help or resources, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm in the chat and I'm here to help.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:11.850] - Liz
I'm really excited for this next session because it's dealing with copywriting, which is something that I always strive to be better at because I swear it's the hardest thing. And this speaker is the brains, and that is behind Damn Copy, which I love the name where she writes conversion copy for biz owners and self templates, so you can get great conversion copy without the custom price tag. She also teaches service providers how to be more profitable and sell what they sell without stress. A big, warm welcome to Sandra Van Der Lee. Sandra, thank you so much for agreeing to be part of this.

[00:00:42.910] - Sandra
Honestly, thank you so much for having me. I love doing interviews. It's one of my favorite things.

[00:00:48.990] - Liz
Yes, I love like getting to meet the speakers this way. It's fun. Okay, so today we're going to be talking about copywriting, but more specifically in regards to funnels. So, I wonder if you could quickly provide your definition of conversion copywriting and what a funnel is.

[00:01:07.750] - Sandra
Conversion copywriting is just a really fancy way of saying copy to make sales, right. To me, a conversion doesn't just happen on a sales page, right, it's in everything, it's how you email, it's how you show up, you know, this is not copywriting. But even this is about conversion in some way, right? Everything we do is sales. So, I use the term conversion copywriting because people generally understand that if they want me to write an about page, I am probably not the person to come and ask. Right. I can do those things, but it's not where I specialize. Honestly, to me, it's writing language that helps a person make a decision about your product or your offer. That's conversion copywriting to me. There's probably sleazy people out there who think it's about getting the sale. That's not really how it works, right?

[00:01:59.720] - Liz
Okay. And then what do you consider to be a funnel? Because funnel can be a very interpreted word ,online business.

[00:02:13.290] - Sandra
Well, my company name is Damn Copy.

[00:02:14.900] - Sandra
I'm going to be contrarian in this and be like, you know, I don't have a funnel in place for anything officially, in the sense that my VA is working on some of them. And I have the classic one where it's like, you opt into a thing. We give you a discount on the self-study course, but only in the next five days with deadline funnel, right?

[00:02:32.370] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:02:32.670] - Sandra
Which is kind of the classic minimum viable funnel version, is like, hey, here's a reason to buy this thing. Now we're going to give you something free, we're going to tell you about the offer, and then you choose whether you want it or not, right. That's the most basic version. Then you have super complicated ones where you add on webinars, and now it's like application only, and there's private training, and we'll send you like, a personalized DM funnel in your Instagram, right, all that stuff. You can get real fancy. To me, a funnel is more around. Like, it's about a relationship. Right. It's the process someone goes through to sort of go from not knowing who you are to, oh, hey, this person, I kind of like them. They know what they're talking about.

[00:03:14.900] - Sandra
They do something that's relevant for me to a sale, or not, right, which is also fine.

[00:03:23.250] - Liz
Okay. So, let's keep it simple, let's kind of, because I know we do have a lot of newer bloggers...

[00:03:31.190] - Sandra
Yeah, of course.

[00:03:31.360] - Liz
... attending the Summit. So, we're going to keep it on the simpler side. But let's kind of start with some mistakes you see people make when it comes to copywriting, you know, that isn't going to convert or help make a decision.

[00:03:44.610] - Sandra
Yeah. I think the main thing that I see happen again and again is not daring to be specific. Right. It's that keeping it general, trying to appeal to everyone. And I mean, for bloggers and the newer ones have probably also heard about long tail keywords and get more specific. And you look for that magic SEO juice where it's like, there's a specific group that looks for this and wants to take action, but there's not a lot of competition because it's a longer sort of phrase. Right, that sort of thing. I think that in funnels and in copywriting and in our business and just how we present ourselves, we do our own version of that by infusing, like, standing for something where you know there's so many general things out there that it's by trying to sort of fit in, you kind of get lost in the ocean.

[00:04:33.750] - Liz
Yes. No, I like that. And doesn't necessarily like, yes, you want to stand for something in terms of what your business does, but doesn't necessarily have to be just about that. It could be, you know, what's going on in the world and you have a, you know.

[00:04:47.700] - Sandra
You have an opinion. Yeah. And also a thing where I'm, one of my private clients that I am actually doing more coffee for, she loves fantasy and pop culture references. And she had this very generic, hi, I help business owners that are growing by managing their back end. And I'm like, well, that's cool, but also...

[00:05:07.110] - Liz
Functional, but doesn't infuse the personality.

[00:05:09.290] - Sandra
But can we infuse this sort of, right, it's this thing where I've had a person work with me because I love the comedy show Brooklyn nine nine, and I use, like, a Brooklyn nine nine...

[00:05:19.160] - Sandra
Yes.

[00:05:20.020] - Sandra
...Brooklyn nine nine reference with the Giffy, right. And they were like, oh, my God, I love that show. Then two weeks later, they hired me. Right. It's something that's like that.

[00:05:28.860] - Liz
Yes. I use Brooklyn nine nine gifs all the time.

[00:05:32.560] - Sandra
I love them.

[00:05:35.210] - Liz
I have them like saved. I'm like, Amy excited.

[00:05:39.370] - Sandra
Amy knew binders 

[00:05:43.390] - Liz
Okay. Okay. We're going to get back. Okay. All right, so those are some great examples of like mistakes, being specific, standing for something. If you are brand new and you want to set up your first funnel, and maybe it's even just how do I get them to opt into my freebie, not even like getting to a tripwire, like that's another step.

[00:06:01.090] - Sandra
That's a whole different story. Honestly, you talk about it. Don't do what I just did. So, you all missed the part before this thing was like, oh, I have an opt in somewhere and I don't know where it is and I don't really promote it. And apparently, 150 people have somehow found it, right? Yes. It's this thing where you talk about it, you share it. So, my opt ins are short and digestible, but that's true for my templates too. But I do try to bring a level of professionalism and care to the opt in where it could be a paid product, even if it was only a $7 thing. Right, it could be paid.

[00:06:37.170] - Liz
Sure. If they're trying to design like the landing page where the person gets to and they've got to make the decision, am I going to get email address or not? What are the elements they need or should include to make it more likely that they can, you know get the right person to convert?

[00:06:55.900] - Sandra
All right, so my freebie is all about this, so get that. I love that we just went there. I think for me, it's really around like clarity about what it is and what it will help them do. And I love little mini bios. So, often when people teach about bios, it's very much, especially for about bases around. Like, how do I explain to someone that they should definitely buy from me because I understand them? I buy from people that I like, right. So, if you have, I love having like a little snappy bio. Mine used to always say that I love the city London and Golden Retrievers and the show Brooklyn Nine Nine. Right, like that sort of thing. Yeah, just like a little personable thing. Because it's this thing where people that are looking for new things or for opt in, they're opting into everything left and right. So, I think it's the clarity of what it is and what it will help them do. And a little about section to me is always a big bonus.

[00:07:54.230] - Liz
Okay, I like that. And I would say, if you have never had to write your own little mini bio, because I think it's one thing that someone's like, oh, give me your bio. And I'm like when you're new, like, obviously I've been at a while. Go find mini bios everywhere just to give you ideas. And you can be like, oh, I really like that. And it's like, well, what is it about it that you liked about it? Go read an article on a new site even, right, there's little bios.

[00:08:21.860] - Sandra
Yeah, those are typically the kind of boring bios in there. It's like, what do I like? What do I not like? How would I, you know, or even this thing around like, oh, if I was writing about a bio about my sister, my partner, my job, what would I write? And that was, right? And then do that for yourself, too.

[00:08:39.350] - Liz
Yes. And I would say like, take this a little bit. I don't think we're playing talk about bios, but I think it's one thing that is so important that people do struggle with. I would say take a day and write a bunch and then like make different versions. Like a long version, a short version, a medium version, a version that kind of focuses on this aspect of that aspect. That's actually something I did earlier this year. I set it up in like, so I used to look up where I was like, here's my medium blogging focus bio. Here's my long blogging focus bio...

[00:09:12.690] - Sandra
You're so organized.

[00:09:13.630] - Liz
...here's my legal bio, here's my, you know, for my personal finance site. Here's the finance focus where I've been featured in these, you know like.

[00:09:21.970] - Sandra
The mini version of this is I have an Apple note that has a few of the lines that you just read at the beginning. And that's my bio. But I have it on my list to create like a bio template with little formulas and different versions for my template shop. And I just keep not getting around to it.

[00:09:35.530] - Liz
Yes. I finally like really managed to get my ish together. There's still things I'm working on, right? In large part because of another speaker at the summit and like process trading, but I would highly recommend doing that. That way you can go and grab it. You know where it's at. I also did it, so my VA could grab it, you know. It's just handy to not have to constantly dig up what did I submit to the last time, someone asked me for a bio?

[00:10:04.810] - Sandra
Right, yes.

[00:10:05.180] - Liz
That's for a long time, s. Okay, so I love that. So, landing page, you want to be clear, you want to provide the result that's going to get them, and you want to include a mini bio, so that they can start like you.

[00:10:16.700] - Sandra
And a mock up. We always want to see what we're getting, so we want a mock up image, for sure.

[00:10:23.590] - Liz
I like it. like it doesn't have to be super long or complicated.

[00:10:30.490] - Sandra
No, mine is super short. I think it's this thing where I always joke that if you can explain it simply, you probably don't understand it well enough.

[00:10:44.830] - Liz
Yes, I like that. Yeah.

[00:10:52.910] - Sandra
It's a free thing. If you need to scroll 20 times on a long form page to convince someone to get your free thing, it's not the right thing for the right person.

[00:11:02.870] - Liz
Okay. Now for those that are maybe a little more advanced and working on setting up that tripwire or that one time offer, or that, you know, whatever phrase you want to use because you like the context of it better than tripwire, you know, that's got to be a little bit longer. You're asking them to hand over money. You know I assume you're going to include really the same kind of stuff that you're including in the free version, you know, the freebie. But what else do you need when you're looking at that, you know?

[00:11:31.470] - Sandra
So, mine are really like a short sales page, like a mini sales page, right? I think that's something that a lot of people forget or kind of hide. I want that confirmation that the thing they opted in for, it's on its way, right. So, I want that job thing not to be like, hey, here's a special one time offer. Yes, we have that. But first, we have a hey, you're in, hey, your guide is on its way to your inbox right now, and in the meantime, I have a special offer for you. Right?

[00:12:00.810] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:01.110] - Sandra
So, to make it clear that the thing that they actually opted in for and did succeeded at work, I think that's very very important, right? That we show the person, like, hey, we got you, and also, here's a special little offer.

[00:12:14.970] - Liz
Okay. I like that because I definitely feel like sometimes, not often, it's rare where I've opted into something I'm taking to a sales page, but I don't think I ever actually managed to get the free thing.

[00:12:24.830] - Sandra
Right. It's weird, it's like, where's my, but you promise, right? And I think it's the thing where there's so many skeezed people out there that we don't even realize if we copy what other people are doing, we don't even realize that we're doing something that's a little bit weird. And I've recently had it where someone will upsell you, and they say something, right? You buy a thing, and then they try to sell you something more expensive or something else, and they go like, your order is incomplete. And that is BS. Right. It's not true. You already paid. You're getting your thing. They're just making you another offer. So, it's that sort of thing. It's, like, confirmed that, hey, everything's cool. Right? But also, I have something special for you.

[00:13:04.650] - Liz
No, I love, especially because upsells, because it does go through.

[00:13:08.460] - Sandra
Of course.

[00:13:10.250] - Liz
You know like, they're like, it's incomplete, and so it's like you have to hit no thing, something.

[00:13:14.570] - Sandra
Yeah. And even if you leave 30 minutes later, depending on the system with Thrive Cart, 30 minutes later, the order gets passed, you get your things. It's fine.

[00:13:22.750] - Liz
Yeah, so just being upfront and honest, I think is the best way.

[00:13:27.620] - Sandra
Yeah. But also, it's also a part of customer service, right? It's like, hey, no matter what you choose to do next, the first thing, we got you there. And other than that, I think it's very much the same. For Tripwire, I want to see a good deal. I don't want 20% off. I want 50% off. Otherwise, I'm not going to get up and get my credit card details out of my purse. I think it's like that. I think it's that. And what it could also be is that it's really like an offer that's not available anywhere else, right? So, maybe you don't do a big discount. You do, hey, this offer is truly not available anywhere else.

[00:14:03.470] - Liz
I do like that. Okay. All right. Now, if you are getting more compared, because you did mention it, or you're trying to do like, an upsell. So we already know. Be honest, don't be skeedy. Let me think about how I phrase this question. When do you think an upsell works best?

[00:14:27.990] - Sandra
I think an upsell at some point is just a statistic.

[00:14:31.270] - Liz
Okay.

[00:14:32.470] - Sandra
So, I think that when it comes to funnels, you can get highly strategic. And I have an amazing friend who's very highly strategic with this, and she'll go like, this offer has this exact upsell because of this reason. And we'll do customized copy and, at the same time, what you aside from the really strategic, highly specialized funnel expert people, right? These are funnel strategists I'm talking about. It comes back down to statistics. So, this thing where if 1% conversion is the industry average, you might see that over time, you kind of converge towards that. So, it's this thing where on my template, I have the same upsell on everything, because I said at one upsell page, and I tacked it on everything just before Black Friday. It's like, well, we'll see. Whatever. I haven't bought it yet, right? And that's fine, because not enough people have seen that page to make that mean anything. And I chose to do, like, a higher ticket. It's a self study course, right? And it's discounted, but it's still expensive. It's a significant investment, and there's not a payment plan. You can only pay in one go.

[00:15:37.420] - Sandra
And the reasoning with that is kind of like, well, you can go lower ticket and maybe get a higher ConvertKit rate, but if you sell something expensive, you only need to sell it once to still make five times more money, right. So, it's that sort of thing of upsell, what you have, right? I wouldn't go and create something specific. And I've actually had it where someone signed up for my group program and bought the self study version of my other program, and it was ugly. It was so ugly. And you know, there's no way this is not, like, statistically appropriate because the sign up group was so small. But I was like, oh, if from now on, 20% of the people will go and buy this ugly ass up to help for $500. So, don't go creating things from scratch if you have a complimentary thing that they might also like.

[00:16:37.790] - Liz
Okay, no, I do like that. So, one thing I want to go back because you said not enough people have seen this for me to know if it works or not.

[00:16:46.370] - Sandra
Yeah.

[00:16:47.890] - Liz
Because you won't know if your copy is good, necessarily. I mean, sometimes you could tell to a certain extent, and I'd love to get into that, but how do you track it? What is enough people in order to tell if something is working or not?

[00:17:02.060] - Sandra
I mean, for an opt in page, if 50 people have seen it and no one's downloaded it, you have a problem. You have for sure a problem. For a paid product, if it's had 100 unique visitors, I would expect at least one sale.

[00:17:16.390] - Liz
Okay.

[00:17:17.530] - Sandra
And you know, I'm a copywriter. I see above average conversion rates on almost everything, but whenever clients are feeling kind of upset or disappointed by a launch result or this or that, I go like, well, how much traffic did you get to a page? Right? How many individual people? And then it's like, oh, look, 2% conversion rate. That's actually pretty standard, right?

[00:17:38.150] - Liz
Yes.

[00:17:38.840] - Sandra
So, for an opt in page, it really depends. There's really amazing people with really targeted, engaged audiences. They get 60 or 70% conversion on a freebie. I don't even know what mine is because I don't even track it. Come on to my newsletter. Eventually, there's a sale, or you'll find you'll buy something that's cool, right? I don't really care where you came from, as long as you come, okay. Which is maybe don't do as I say. I do it. But that's how I kind of look at life, and my business go like, well, I can't do everything perfectly, so what can I do when I run with that?

[00:18:13.810] - Liz
Okay, if you find that, you know, it's not working, do you have any tips on identifying what part of the page is the problem?

[00:18:22.690] - Sandra
This is so hard.

[00:18:25.170] - Liz
No, I'm sorry.

[00:18:26.550] - Sandra
I would say get a heat map, but honestly, I've had one offer going out this year that made zero sales. That has never, ever happened to me, ever. And it was just before Black Friday, and it was high ticket, and I was like, well, is everyone saving their money for Black Friday? Is everyone listening to the talk about inflation? Is it just not a good offer? And I knew the positioning wasn't right. It was more like a last hallelujah. Halfway through, I decided I was going to scrap the offer and turn it into something else anyway, because the positioning has never been right. But it's almost impossible to pivot point. I think that even beyond just saying the page where the copy is working, the question is also, like, do you have a sales problem or a lead problem or an actual messaging problem? That's really hard to say, because if ten people look at your offer and no one buys it, that doesn't really tell me that the copy is wrong. That tells me you probably have a traffic or conversion problem in getting people to click.

[00:19:31.620] - Liz
Okay.

[00:19:33.590] - Sandra
So, it's really tricky.

[00:19:35.760] - Liz
Okay. Yeah.

[00:19:36.600] - Liz
And everyone, I asked a very broad question. You gave me a good answer. 

[00:19:42.570] - Sandra
Because I was like, oh, no, like, sweaty armpits over here.

[00:19:47.450] - Liz
It is. Everyone's going to be, the answer is really always, it depends. But you gave some great examples.

[00:19:54.050] - Sandra
I think heat map is a good place to sort of start, honestly. I know I should have them. I don't. But if you're looking at that, then go there. But the thing with that is, like, this is ironic because it kind of devalues the work and what I do. And I will say that again. Me and most of my clients get way above average conversion rates. Right? The ugliest, most basic, bitch, stupid, spammy, ugly, crappy website out there, I don't know if I can swear, I think I just did, sorry, will still get a 1% conversion rate. As long as 100 people land on it, someone will somehow buy it. That's kind of like a weird law of nature. So, this thing to me is like, if I get 100 people on it and no one buys it, then I know something's not right.

[00:20:41.920] - Liz
Okay. Got it. And you talk about sort of messaging and positioning. Because I think that is I mean, I know that's something that I've not done well in the past and probably am still not doing well in a lot of places, but can you kind of explain what that is for people that are like, what are you talking about?

[00:21:03.890] - Sandra
I think there's kind of two ways to approach it, right. Part of it is messaging and positioning is something that I do about my business. And a much bigger part is what you think about me and my business and what you think I do. Right. So, messaging is very much the outward thing. Okay. My company is called Damn Copy. If you're strictly religious, which is cool, like, I go to church sometimes, you're more than welcome to come, but you might be offended by me. It's fine. Right. So that's like a messaging and a positioning thing around who I am as a person and as a business and as a business owner. It's like bold to the point. I don't want long drawn out processes. Right. It's all that sort of just kind of combined in a name, and then you see the branding. It all kind of works together in a cohesive kind of way. But it's not as much as I say what it is. It's what other people say about me.

[00:21:58.950] - Liz
Okay. How it's perceived.

[00:22:02.570] - Sandra
Yeah. It's what other people say about you is probably more important than what you say about yourself. And at the same time, you have agency. Right. You have a part where you can show up. I feel like in some ways, for me, messaging is more specific about the offer and how it helps a specific person, right. So, it's around who is it for and why should they care. If you want to improve any of your copy for anything holding on this, who's it for, why should they give a fuck? I think that's literally the essence of what I do.

[00:22:38.210] - Liz
Okay. I like that.

[00:22:40.610] - Sandra
Yeah. 

[00:22:41.941] - Liz
Simple. You said if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.

[00:22:45.110] - Sandra
Yeah.

[00:22:46.310] - Liz
Okay. So, we are starting to run short on time, and I know you do have an awesome freebie for the attendees. You want to tell us a little bit about it?

[00:22:55.830] - Sandra
Yeah, of course. So, I have a mystery PDF checklist on what you need for a high converting landing page. So, it's very much about what we talked about. It's beautifully branded PDF. I actually read it the other day because, honestly, I forget I have this kind of stuff. I'm the most disorganized, chaotic business owner. You've heard it, right? Oh, you should have a heat map. I don't have it. But you should have one.

[00:23:18.080] - Liz
I don't have it either. I'm slowly getting organized, but same boat. Sometimes you look back and you're like, man, that's so good. I should really do more with that.

[00:23:26.530] - Sandra
Yeah. So, I will say go and download that because it's probably a summary, and it will have some different things that we talked about. And the other thing is, I have a general newsletter sign up on my website. So, if you're just, like, send your team school. I want to be in her world. Go over to the site, pop in your email. You'll start getting my weekly newsletters. Because I think the thing that I really want to want you to take away from this is that there's a lot of things we can do to fine tune and to perfect and to maybe improve conversion with a tiny little bit. Until you come to a place where half a percentage point in conversion rate matters a lot to your sale, I would much rather have you focus on things that get you in front of more people, get you more traffic, make more offers. How do you figure out the messaging? You figure out what people respond to. Right? So, I would say go and do imperfect things and get more offers out there over. Put in a heat map and try to get 2% more opt in.

[00:24:25.890] - Sandra
It's like, no, go tell an extra thousand people about your optin.

[00:24:29.180] - Liz
Yes. Done is done. Perfect. Go get something done.

[00:24:32.340] - Sandra
Exactly.

[00:24:33.590] - Liz
Yes. All right. Definitely, go check that out, guys. Sandra, thank you so much again. I really appreciate it. I learned a lot. I've made a lot of notes. Just thank you for being here.

[00:24:43.790] - Sandra
Of course. Thank you so much for having me.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:11.930] - Sarah Jane Burt
Hey, you all. Welcome to my presentation on four simple promotional strategies to get more eyes on your blog content. I'm just getting over a cold, so if I sound a little froggy, that's why. Who am I? I am Sarah Jane. I'm a copywriter, content strategist, and content marketer. I've been doing this for 12 years, working with both huge companies like IBM and Intuit and small businesses. Today, I work with a lot of coaches, creative, service providers that own their own small business. My goal is to help businesses grow their audience, build trust, and make fat stacks of cash, which I think we can all agree is a goal at some point. I've worked with a lot of different brands, and now I'm focused on helping small businesses, entrepreneurs. My focus is typically on content marketing without manipulation. So just instead of tricking people into buying your stuff, just being honest and creative about how to talk about the value and all that stuff. So that's me. Let's get into what you'll learn today. So these are four promotional strategies, ways to get more eyes on your blog content. And for each of these four, I'm going to go through three basic things.

[00:01:48.430] - Sarah Jane Burt
So the first thing is simple ways to promote your blog content. So what that strategy is, the reason for this, so you can grow your audience and make some money. The second part will be how to get started with each strategy. A lot of the times, things that you learn at summits like this can be a little overwhelming. You're learning so much from so many different people, and you have so many things now on your to-do list. It can be really overwhelming to even know where to get started. So for each of these tactics, I've given you the one thing you can do to get started with the strategy. The goal is for you to take some action and start making some progress. And then some tips for being successful. So for some of these, if you are a little more advanced, some of these you may already be doing. So some of these tips are pro tips for those of you who have not used the strategy yet. These are just helpful ways to be successful so that your time, effort, energy, and sometimes money is well spent.

[00:02:56.240] - Sarah Jane Burt
So before we get into it, I just want to clarify simple does not equal, easy, or quick. So a lot of the times in the online business space, in the content creation space, you'll hear a lot of people talk about quick and easy ways to make a bajillion dollars or to create five million blog posts in an hour. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. With that in mind, all of these tactics are simple in the sense that you can wrap your mind around them very easily, and they're easy to get started with. They don't require any special skills or money to get started. However, they are not necessarily easy. A lot of these are a bit time intensive, so they're not quick either. By simple, I just mean anyone can do these, can use these strategies to grow their audience to get more eyes on their blog post, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are easy.

[00:04:05.000] - Sarah Jane Burt
So with that warning in mind, let's get started. So the first tactic, you're probably rolling your eyes at this and thinking, ""Duh, Sarah"", is to share on social. But I'm going to give you a few hopefully interesting ways to think about this. So don't underestimate the power of social media when it comes to getting eyes on your content. It's a really great way to grow your audience, right? So when you have an email list or something, you share your content with your email list, those are people that have already they've signed up, they're part of your audience. But on social media, you can talk to people who are not already part of your audience. They can find you through different ways. So don't underestimate the power of that. It's a great place to build an audience. And if someone likes what you have to say in short form, your social posts, then they'll likely really like your blog content where you get a little more in-depth.

[00:05:06.920] - Sarah Jane Burt
So how to get started here? And so even if you're already posting on social, you're already active on a couple of different channels. If you're not consistently posting, I want you to think about this as a starting place for consistently posting, right? So most of us are probably on social. So I'm not going to say how to get started is to sign up for a social platform, but to get started posting consistently, to get started getting results from this, I want you to pick one social media channel to focus on. And I'm serious about that. I know how it can be if you're ambitious, if you're efficient. You might think, well, I can post on four different channels, the same content, whatever. Just to get yourself in the mindset of doing one thing really well, I want you to focus on one social media channel. If you're able to post on the others, great, but I want you to focus on that one as your core channel. And then once you're able to post there consistently, move on to something else. Not move on, but add something else to your channels.

[00:06:22.470] - Sarah Jane Burt
Commit to posting there consistently each week. What does consistency look like? It's really how often can you post on a consistent basis? So if you can only commit to posting three times a week, then post three times a week. You're not consistent until you've done it, I would say, for a couple of months at least. So focus on that. In terms of how often you should post? It depends on the channel. So just go by what the best practices are. So, for instance, Twitter or X, people will post three to five times a day, whereas on LinkedIn, mostly people will post once a day and mostly Monday through Friday.

[00:07:09.920] - Sarah Jane Burt
So when you find a channel that you really want to focus on, just consider what are the best practices for that channel. Now, in terms of getting more eyes on your actual blog post. So the end goal might be to get them to read the post, subscribe to your blog or your email newsletter, but you have to earn trust before you can get them there. So instead of, I've seen this a lot, people will just post links to their blog, sometimes with a little teaser, and that's their post. However, people are not going to click on that link unless they know you, they like you, they trust you, especially with phishing scams and all that stuff. So what you want to do is you want to take that blog content, repurpose it into social posts so that you're sharing the valuable information there so they can get to know you, like you, trust you, and then you can point them to the blog for more details.

[00:08:12.880] - Sarah Jane Burt
So for instance, let's say you are in... A lot of my examples are probably going to be in marketing just because that's the niche I'm in, so it's easiest to talk about. Let's say you write a blog post about your ""10 Favorite SaaS Tools for SEO."" You're not just going to list all 10 in the post and say, if you want more information, go here, whatever. You might focus a post on each of those 10. So you write 10 different posts that focus on one tool, and then the end says, I've got a whole list of great tools for other aspects of your SEO. If you want to read more, check out my blog. So it's not just about summarizing the blog post and then putting a link to the post. It's more about taking the valuable tidbits that you've got in that blog post, repurposing them for social. And then if people like that and they want more detail, then they can go to read the blog post. But that's how you're going to build that trust to get people to actually go to your site later on.

[00:09:27.160] - Sarah Jane Burt
Some tips: focus on one channel. I'm very serious about that. I am an overachiever. I have tried to do multiple channels. I'm just going to start posting everywhere all the time. It doesn't work. So focus on one channel. Once you get consistent there, then add a channel, right? And if you're able to, let's say, you are able to stay consistent and you post every once in a while on another channel, that's totally fine. But you want to make sure that one channel gets all of your attention and your consistency before you move on. Set aside some time in your calendar to get this done. So, for example, I have on my calendar every day, Monday through Friday at 8:30 to post to LinkedIn and engage on LinkedIn. My core channel has changed over time. Right now it's LinkedIn. So that's where I spend most of my time. If I'm able to post on Facebook or Instagram during the week, that's great. But LinkedIn is that one place that I always post Monday through Friday. I always engage. And so I just set aside that time in my calendar, and it really has helped me get more consistent. Now, do I occasionally miss that half hour in my calendar? Sure. I post content ahead of time, so the content is still Monday through Friday going out. Sometimes I miss that engagement piece, but it's always on my calendar. There's always space for it.

[00:11:07.350] - Sarah Jane Burt
Engage 15 minutes before and after you post. This is just a thing for the algorithm. When it sees you engaging, it's more likely to then show your content to people. Also, when you are engaging on someone else's post, they are more likely to then go look at your profile and engage with your content. It doesn't always happen, but they're more likely to, when they see engagement from you, reciprocate that engagement. So if you get on for 15 minutes before you post, so since I schedule my post ahead of time, what I'll do is at 8:30, I might schedule the post for 8:45 or 8:40. I'll get on at 8:30, start engaging, and then the post goes live. I don't manually post it, and then I continue engaging for the full half hour. So that's 30 minutes out of every day that I do that. And in the grand scheme of things, it's really not taking away from my time doing other stuff. It's really, I finished my coffee, I engaged on LinkedIn, and I've been able to keep consistent with that.

[00:12:17.890] - Sarah Jane Burt
You also want to create a repeatable process for repurposing. So sometimes when people think of repurposing, they think of just maybe copying and pasting pieces of it into something else. But honestly, repurposing, you can do it a lot of different ways. It really depends on the channel that you're posting stuff on. So for my longer pieces, for my blog posts, my YouTube videos, my emails, my longer pieces of content, I'll repurpose into post for different channels. And so I do have a process for that. I usually pull the top three takeaways and use some of the content from that, and then lead people to the full post or ask them to join the email list or watch the YouTube video, whatever. So I have a repeatable process for that. So every time I sit down to repurpose, I'm not reinventing the wheel. I have a way that I look at the content that I take pieces out, and then I'm able to publish things. So having your own process, there is no one perfect process for this, but having your own process makes it something not only that you can do without thinking about it, but that later on you could actually outsource, you could get support from a VA (virtual assistant) or whatever to do that for you.

[00:13:43.850] - Sarah Jane Burt
Another suggestion is to use a tool like Quuu Promote to get your posts in front of new people. So Quuu is a tool that helps you curate content. So a lot of social media managers will use curated content as part of their strategy so that they're not constantly having to create new content. They might share a helpful article. That's like part of their ongoing process. So Quuu is a tool that helps people find curated content that they can share on their channels. Quuu Promote is like the other side of that. There is a cost to it. It is a subscription-based thing. But basically, you put your blog post on there, and then the people that are curating content will see your blog post and be able to share that on their social. I will say I've only used this for myself, so I'm not sure that it works for every niche, but it's worth looking into. It's a pretty cool tool, especially for any people that their audience is small business owners or people in marketing. This is a pretty cool tool to use. If you're in a different niche, let's say you're super, super niche, you only talk about growing trees, you might not find your people on Quuu Promote. It's worth looking into, though, see what's on Quuu, and then that will give you an idea, which I think Quuu is free to use. That will give you an idea of whether or not that might be worthwhile to you.

[00:15:29.640] - Sarah Jane Burt
Share in communities. So this is the second strategy. And what I mean by communities, any place that people are gathering on the internet, I think that this is a really underutilized resource for sharing blog content, for getting the word out about your blog. So we're looking at forums like Quora and Reddit, Facebook communities, Slack groups, other community platforms like Circle, where people are gathering online to talk about a specific thing. These communities are full of people asking questions about your topic. They need support, they have questions, they want to know what's going on, they want suggestions, whatever. Then these might be things that you've already answered in a blog post somewhere. So what's great about this is they're raising their hands. They're saying, I want this information. I need this information. I'm interested in the topic. I need support. You're not having to go and find them somewhere. They're all concentrated in this one place where you can engage and share your information.

[00:16:41.360] - Sarah Jane Burt
So how do you get started with this? There are a bajillion groups out there, but I think the best place to start is to survey your audience. And this survey that you do, I would do it periodically, maybe once a year, is going to give you more than just information about what communities your people are in. You're also going to find out what are they interested in. You might find that something that you thought was really important is not important to them, or something that you never thought to write about is something they're very interested in. So survey your audience and how to survey three to five questions tops. Most people will not answer more than that. Some of these could be multiple choice, could be open ended. It just depends on the question that you're asking. So you want to find out where are they getting their information from? So what publications are they reading? This is going to help you with things like guest blogging and collaborating with other people. Find out what they're reading, where they get their information. What other blogs are they reading on the same topic? What communities do they belong to? Likely you'll find some communities that you've never heard of, because, for instance, I'm part of a few different Slack groups for marketers. These are things that I just randomly found out about. Somebody told me about it. I saw an ad for it. They're not just like everyone knows about them. They're just Slack groups that I found out about randomly, and that might be the same for you. You might find that your people are hanging out in these places that you never thought to look. So this is also your opportunity to ask any questions that are really going to help you better understand your audience and be able to build a bigger audience. But think carefully about what three to five questions you pick, because again, if you ask too many questions, people might not fill out the whole thing. The way to get buy-in for this, the best way to get buy-in for this, I've done this every time I've run a survey and I've gotten enough answers, is to enter everyone who participates into a drawing for a prize. Now, that prize can be anything from a free product. So a product that you sell, maybe you give it to them for free. Maybe it's a consultation with you. But it can also just be like a $5 Starbucks gift card. Just think of something that they would want that would entice them to actually go through with the survey. So this is going to cost you a little bit of money. But again, it's something you do once a year, and it's really going to give you a lot of data, not just for promotional strategies, but just in general.

[00:19:38.410] - Sarah Jane Burt
Tips for making this work. Take that data that you get from the survey and join some of those communities. Before you participate, before you start answering questions, just observe. What's going on? What are people talking about? What's the etiquette for participating in the group? There are a lot of groups, a lot of subreddits, a lot of Facebook groups where you cannot promote, you can't promote your own stuff. In that case, you might answer a question and say, I have a blog post about this. If you want to read it, just let me know, DM me, whatever. So you might not be able to post your link, but you can still open up a conversation. So join the group, figure out what the etiquette is. And then once you do start adding to the conversation, make sure that you're adding value. You're not just spamming with links or CTAs. People will tend to ignore that. Even if the post you wrote is the best post ever written on this topic, so insightful, so beautiful, they're going to love it. They don't know that from you just posting the link, so make sure that you add some value. If you are allowed to post links, make sure that you tie that link to your blog. You tie that blog to the question that you're answering. So for instance, let's say you wrote a blog post on the best computers for teenagers, the best laptops for teenagers. And someone asked, I want to get my teen a new laptop. I'm thinking a Mac, but I'm not quite sure, whatever. You answer the question, you can say, yeah, a Mac is great for these reasons, but there are also more affordable laptops that you can buy your teen. I actually wrote a blog post on this that goes into a lot more detail if you want to read it, and then post the link. Just make sure there's a connection. It's not just some random thing that you're spamming people with.

[00:21:42.790] - Sarah Jane Burt
Guest blogging is our third strategy. This might be something you're already doing, but I do have a few pro tips if this is something you're already doing. Guest blogging you're posting is a great way to use someone else's audience to get in front of new people. And the best part about guest blogging and also collaborations, which is, surprise, our fourth strategy, is that it's a win-win. So the blog host owner is getting really great content to put on their blog. You are getting the opportunity to get in front of a new audience.

[00:22:25.890] - Sarah Jane Burt
How to get started? So the first thing you need to do is find blogs that you can submit your guest post to. So just a few parameters for this should have a similar audience or an overlapping audience. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a blog that's just like yours. Let's say that you are a gardening blog, and this blog is about maybe growing vegetables specifically. That audience overlaps with the general... Or let's say it's the other way around. You write about vegetables. This is a general gardening publication. There's going to be people that are interested in vegetables in there, so you have an overlapping audience. It may not be everyone in their audiences for you, but there's some people in there that are. And they need to accept guest blog posts. So a lot of blogs that regularly accept guest posts will have a page on their blog that says how to submit a guest post, all the parameters, the rules. Some may not, but you might see that they have guest posts on there, or you might reach out. Maybe they've never considered having a guest post. You might reach out and ask if they're open to it. But obviously do that work first before you start pitching, because if they're not even open to guest blog post, you're wasting your time there.

[00:23:50.830] - Sarah Jane Burt
You want to find blogs that have an audience that's bigger than yours, but not so big right off the bat. So if the only place you've ever written is in your blog, and you've got 15 blog posts in there, you're not going to go pitch Forbes, right? Because they're looking for people that have a history of publishing in publications with lots and lots of readers. So you want to find a blog that it's likely they'll say yes based on your publication experience. But let's say maybe you have published in some bigger publications, then you can go for those bigger publications. But you really want to just focus on where your audience is, where you're likely to get in, what fits with the content you talk about and the content that's on their blog. I think a great place to start is with your favorite blogs and publications. You also will find that out in the survey, so you can use that information. Again, that's a great place to start. Look at the things that you already like and know. It's easier to pitch to a place that you know than a brand new place.

[00:25:11.260] - Sarah Jane Burt
So, some tips. This can be super time-consuming strategy because you can be writing pitches all day. It's also a bit of a numbers game. Just statistically, you might pitch to 10 places and only get accepted to one. So consider that when you're picking which publications to pitch you, don't waste your time pitching the ones that might not be a good fit.

[00:25:38.770] - Sarah Jane Burt
Read the blog. Actually, read the blog or publication to get a feel for the style of the content and the types of topics. Your pitch is going to be way better for it. If you understand what people have written about, you understand what content does well on the blog, you'll be able to pitch, make a better pitch.

[00:25:59.300] - Sarah Jane Burt
Follow their submission guidelines. Some blogs have really not complicated, but a long list of things that you have to keep in mind, like you're only allowed to use two links to your own content. You can't talk about a topic that's already been talked about. They don't want how-to content or they only want how-to content. Look at that stuff before you come up with pitch ideas.

[00:26:25.300] - Sarah Jane Burt
In your pitch, take time to show them how it's going to add value for their readers. So if they have a bigger audience than you, you need them more than they need you. So really talk about how it's going to add value for their readers, not necessarily how great you are, although that's a piece of the pitch as well. Here's a pro tip. If you can offer an SEO angle, this often makes it easier to get the guest post. Everyone's concerned with SEO, so you can write a post that will bring traffic to their page. They're more likely to say yes. So how do you do this? Look at the posts that have been made, look for common themes, think about those subtopics that have been posted about, and think about what is missing here. Where are the gaps? Then once you get those topics, you can do keyword research and say, okay, there's this many people look up this keyword. There's definitely traffic potential here - ""I want to write a blog post around this keyword, here's my suggestion'"".

[00:27:34.020] - Sarah Jane Burt
Okay, the fourth and final strategy, collaboration. So collaborating with others in your niche who already have an audience is a great way to get in front of new people, get new people into your world. This can look any way you want it to. There's not one right way to collaborate, which is what I love about collaborations. You can partner with a micro influencer. You can hold a joint webinar. You can get interviewed on a podcast. There are a bunch of different ways that you can work with others to build your audience and help them build theirs.

[00:28:08.060] - Sarah Jane Burt
So first step is to find the people that you want to collaborate with. They don't have to be influencers. They can be other bloggers. They can be people who blog about adjacent things. They can be other business owners. A good place to start is within your own network. So do you have a friend in an adjacent industry? Or maybe you have a colleague that you just really love talking about something with and they want to collaborate someone who has a podcast, anyone that you already know that you think would be a great collaboration opportunity, that's a great place to start.

[00:28:43.830] - Sarah Jane Burt
Tips, build a relationship with the person before you ask them for a favor. Don't randomly email people and say, ""Hey, you want to collaborate.."", and they don't even know who you are. They're more likely to work with you if they know and trust you, just like your audience is more likely to buy from you when they know and trust you. One good way to collaborate without collaborating is to interview subject matter experts, include the quotes from the interview in your blog posts. They will likely share the link to the blog post once it comes out if they're featured in the blog post. So consider that that's an easy way to collaborate, an easy yes for people. They don't have to do any work other than do the interview. And then come to the conversation with an idea of how you might potentially collaborate. Don't make the other person do the work, say, here's a great collaboration opportunity. Let's do it. The more specific you can get there, the better. So I want to do a newsletter swap. Here's what that will look like, et cetera.

[00:29:56.310] - Sarah Jane Burt
So action steps. Pick one of these strategies to focus on first, just one. Take the first step toward making it happen, so that how to get started? Take that first step. Do the work to make it work before you move on to something else.

[00:30:10.590] - Sarah Jane Burt
Any questions you have, you can ask? Now I'm happy to answer them.

[00:30:18.570] - Sarah Jane Burt
And before we go, I have a free guide for you that has all of my tips, tools, and tech for promoting your content. Totally free to you. It's something that I might eventually sell in my shop, but for now it's free, and I made it just for you. These are advanced tips for the strategies that we talked about today, some additional strategies I didn't have time to get into, so just a deeper dive into these, some info about my processes or how I save time doing these strategies, how I have made a repeatable process, also the tech tools I use. So I know a lot of people might have questions about what tools, what software can I use to help with the promotion aspect? All of that is inside here. So it just dives a little deeper, gives you a little more information to get this. This is an example page, but to get this, you just click on that button, and yeah, it'll take you to the magical link.

[00:31:20.590] - Sarah Jane Burt
So thank you for coming to my presentation. I hope that you took away something that you can apply to promoting your blog post.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.060] - Sherry
Hey there. I'm Sherry Smothermon Short from Painless blog analytics. And welcome to my presentation today. We're going to be talking about Google Analytics Four, which I know has caused a lot of angst in the blogging world. But before we get into that, I do want to say a big thank you to Liz for having me here at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit again this year.

[00:00:31.920] - Sherry
So, thank you so much. Let's go ahead and jump into the presentation. Now one thing I want you guys to know is that this presentation is really focused on Bloggers and not on ecommerce, and you'll learn a little bit more about that as we go through here. But I just wanted to make sure that you guys know that this is for bloggers and not necessarily for ecommerce sites.

[00:00:54.490] - Sherry
Let me talk a little bit about what we're going to cover today. We're going to talk about what is Google Analytics four. I'll share some differences between GA4 and universal analytics.

[00:01:05.310] - Sherry
We'll talk about the cool stuff and the not so cool stuff in GA4. We'll discuss what you should do now, and we'll talk a little bit about events, which we'll cover that in just a little bit to explain to you what that is. And then I'm going to do a quick Google Analytics 4 walk through at the end. So, who am I? Well, I have been a blogger at Cub Scout Ideas for a decade now.

[00:01:30.560] - Sherry
I also blog at Painless blog analytics and the Facts Vault. I used to work for an insurance company, and I love digging around in block data. And I think when I worked at the insurance company, even though I wasn't an analyst, I think some of their, you know, numbers wave runs off of me a little bit. My superpower is making analytical information easy to understand for people who have never been exposed to it before or who are very confused by it. I live in Nashville, married to Scott and mom to Parker and Grant.

[00:02:05.310] - Sherry
Parker is a sophomore in college and Grant's a high school junior. I love Diet, Dr. Pepper, and you'll probably catch me in my spare time reading or watching mysteries. Why did Google decide to make this pretty dramatic change? Well, the primary reason was because of privacy.

[00:02:19.690] - Sherry
We've all heard about GDPR, we've all heard about, you know, the California privacy laws, and over time, people have become more conscientious about privacy and being able to protect that. I think we'll probably see more privacy laws as time goes on. So that's one of the main reasons why Google decided, hey, we need to make a change and make our product a lot more privacy centric. The other big change is that the way we've shopped online has changed a lot.

[00:02:48.570] - Sherry
And one thing to know, Google Analytics is really built, it's built for all websites, but it really is focused a lot more on ecommerce sites than on bloggers. And our needs are very different and all that. But if you think about it, think about the way ten years ago that we bought something online. We went to a website and we made a purchase, and that was it. Now, and I'll give you an example.

[00:03:10.510] - Sherry
My college son was a wrestler in high school. And so, if you know anything about wrestling, wrestling shoes don't last very long. They're just really hard on them. So, a lot of times I would search for, you know, most durable wrestling shoes. Let's say I was looking for that one day, sitting at my desk, you know, looking at it on my desktop, and I find a pair, and I think, okay, those are the ones I'm going to get.

[00:03:30.700] - Sherry
Well, then I look at the time and realize that I'm supposed to be picking up my son right then. So, I hop in my car and drive over to the school to pick them up. When I get there, they're not done yet, so I have a few minutes to wait in the car. At that point in time, I'm probably going to pull out my phone and I'm going to, you know look up those shoes and go ahead and make that purchase on the phone and probably on an app from that retailer. So, in the past, there was no way to say, okay, the Sherry that did all this looking for durable wrestling shoes is the same Sherry that made this purchase in the app.

[00:04:03.210] - Sherry
And so that was really caused an issue for a lot of ecommerce sites because they didn't have all the data they needed to understand the lifecycle. Like, where did I start and how did I end up purchasing? So Ga4 is Google's attempt to kind of help with cross platform and all that. So, those are the two big reasons why Google changed. Now let's talk a little bit about the Ga4 timeline.

[00:04:28.090] - Sherry
First of all, it was really introduced in 2020, and it was still a beta product and all that. So, it was introduced in 2020 and in March of 2022, that's when we found out that universal analytics was going to be sunsetting, and we would not be able to use that anymore. If you haven't heard the date, universal analytics will stop collecting data on July 1st of 2023. Now, a couple of things.

[00:04:55.380] - Sherry
Even though UA will stop collecting new data on July 1st, we will have until October to have access to our historical data. So, there won't be anything new in UA after July 1, but you will be able to go back and look at your historical data up until October. There's no way to transfer your UA data over to GA4. And I'll explain a little bit more about why in just a bit. But there's just no way to transfer it over.

[00:05:21.460] - Sherry
There are going to be some ways that you can export your data and have access to it in the future. And I think as we get a little bit closer to that July timeline, we will have a lot more information about what we can do with that. Now, you may have heard a rumor that the sunset date has been postponed until 2024, and that's kind of true. If you didn't know, google actually has a paid analytics product called Google Analytics 360. If you are paying for 360, your sunset date is not going to be until July 1st of 2024.

[00:05:53.230] - Sherry
I'd be willing to bet 99.99% of us are on the free plan. So, we still have the July 2023 sunset date.

[00:06:04.090] - Sherry
So, let's talk a little bit about some of the differences between UA and GA4. Well, probably the biggest one is that the data model is fundamentally different. With UA, the data model was based on sessions. So, everything related to sessions. With Ga4, everything is going to be based around events. So, I'll get into events a little bit more later on in the presentation.

[00:06:29.650] - Sherry
But let me tell you, just kind of a high level overview what that is. An event is a distinct user interaction on your website or on your app. So, hopefully, that kind of gives you. So, I'll be giving you lots of examples of that in a bit. So, just keep in mind that that's something that's going to measure interactions.

[00:06:49.240] - Sherry
As I talked about earlier, GA4 is focused on the user journey. So, there's going to be cross device and cross platform reporting that will be available. Now, this is not such a big deal for bloggers because most of us don't have an app, so it really doesn't matter too much for us, but it is very significant for companies that are ecommerce companies. There are fewer standard reports in GA4, but it's a lot easier to create an ad hoc report.

[00:07:17.510] - Sherry
Now think about when you go into universal analytics. Over on the left, we've got a whole long list of all these different reports that we can look at and we can manipulate them a little bit. So, just to give you an example, one of the reports that I love to look at is I look at my traffic by page and then by source medium. So, I have to go in every time that I go to that traffic by page, and I have to add that source medium, so that I can see exactly where the traffic is coming from for that blog post. In GA4, I'll be able to easily create a report that shows me that, so that I don't have to add it every time, I can just click on the report and I've got it.

[00:07:55.680] - Sherry
So, I think you'll find that even though there's a lot fewer standard reports, it is going to be a lot easier to make your own now. Now there's going to be a lot better user behavior tracking. And this, I think, is really going to be cool for Bloggers. I think we're going to be able to get so many more metrics that we can use to make our blogs better, get more people there, keep people there longer and all that. And in fact, I want to talk a little bit about the differences in user behavior.

[00:08:24.990] - Sherry
So, in Universal Analytics, we focus on bounce rate, page views and sessions, average session duration, conversions, you know, if you were an ecommerce site or conversion rate, those were the things that we really focus on. Now in GA4, we have a really cool new metric called engagement rate, which I really love. So, for a session to be considered engaged, one of three things has to happen. Either the person has to be on your page for 10 seconds or longer, or they have to visit two or more pages, or they have to do some sort of conversion.

[00:08:59.170] - Sherry
So, if you're an ecommerce site, that would mean making a purchase. For us, it's, whatever we define it as, it could be the newsletters sign up, whatever. So, I think that's going to be really powerful and it's going to help us determine, okay, on this page, my engagement rate is really low. So, you know, maybe I need to do something toward the top of that blog post to entice people to either stay a little bit longer or visit more than one page.

[00:09:23.360] - Sherry
The next thing that we have is something called scroll. And this is actually pretty cool. So, what that means is that 90% of our page was visible. So that means a reader scroll pretty much to the bottom of your blog post and read the whole thing. So, you'll be able to tell my blog post, okay, this one, my scroll rate was really high.

[00:09:44.520] - Sherry
So, this is great. This one over here, they didn't scroll very far, so maybe I need to do some work on that. First visit, now in GA4, there's a lot more focus put on the first visit and I think that's going to be helpful for us over time. So, for example, if you, instead of looking at total visits, you'll be able to break that out and say, okay, the first visit, the very first time somebody came to my site, they're all coming from Pinterest or they're all coming from organic search.

[00:10:16.180] - Sherry
And so, I think that will give you a way to really break that down and see where you're attracting people for the very first time. Outbound click. Now this is pretty cool. If you do a lot of affiliate marketing, this is going to help you be able to track what are people clicking on. So, if you have a blog post that's getting a lot of traffic, but there's a certain link on that page that's not getting very much love, you can go in and look and see.

[00:10:40.690] - Sherry
Do I need to do a little bit better job of explaining the product? Do I need to make the anchor text a little different? You know, do something like that to try to improve that click rate for that particular link. I think this is also going to be good for those of you who do sponsored work. Let's say you're a travel blogger and you're working with convention and visitors bureau, and they've set you up to stay at a hotel, go to a couple of restaurants, do a couple of attractions.

[00:11:05.340] - Sherry
You'll be able to tell them, okay, from this blog post that I did for you, we had this many clicks to the hotel, this many to the attractions, this many to the restaurants. So, I think that's going to be really helpful to be able to provide some reporting back to our sponsors when we do sponsored work. File download. If you have files that are available for people to download, you'll be able to tell how many of those are getting clicked. And then if you embed YouTube videos on your blog post, you're going to be able to track things like video start, how far they go, how many of them watch the whole thing.

[00:11:38.830] - Sherry
So, I think that's going to be helpful for us too.

[00:11:43.460] - Sherry
Let's talk about some of the cool GA4 stuff. Now, I've already talked about our new engagement rate metric. I think this is going to be huge for us. We're going to have the opportunity to get very granular in analyzing our blog posts and know which ones we really need to work on, you know, to get people to stay. Because if you're getting them over to your website, want them to stay there a little bit, at least get them there to read a little bit of your blog post.

[00:12:07.570] - Sherry
So, I think this is going to be really significant for us. Bounce rate is totally different. Totally different. In the old UA, bounce rate was basically when somebody came to your site and left without doing anything else. And that's going away, and I think that's a good thing.

[00:12:27.430] - Sherry
So, let me give you an example. Let's say your blog gets a lot of pinterest traffic, and maybe you're a food blogger. Well, we know a lot of times people will come to your site and they'll look at your recipe and leave. You might have a high bounce rate for that particular blog post, but it may be that the reason they left was because they got the recipe they wanted. They didn't want to look at any of your other recipes.

[00:12:49.560] - Sherry
So, you know that looked really bad. Like, oh, we've had this super high bounce rate for this blog post. Well, with GA4, what bounce rate is now is it is the inverse of this engagement rate metric. Let me just give you an example. I looked at my Cup Scout Ideas blog, and you know, I would have the typical blog bounce rate, which would be 75, 80%, sometimes even a little bit higher than that.

[00:13:16.740] - Sherry
But when I looked at the bounce rate in GA4, it was about 35%. I also had an engagement rate of about 65%, so that adds up to 100. So, it's basically the opposite of that. But the good news about that is it tells me that even though people might come to one blog post on my site and then leave, they're staying there for a little while. It's much better than what we thought before.

[00:13:42.040] - Sherry
I love that we can track outbound clicks. I just think that's going to be really helpful for us for lots of reasons. I think that's pretty cool. We can customize our reports so much easier. Even with a few standard reports that we have in GA4, we can customize those.

[00:13:58.510] - Sherry
And I love that. I think that's just going to be really super good for us. It's going to mean the difference in you go into analytics, open it up, and then having to manipulate a report that you look at. Like I mentioned, that in the source medium. You don't have to do that.

[00:14:12.940] - Sherry
You've got your report, you can go right in there. You can even set your menu to be just the reports that you want to look at. So, I look at this one, look at this one instead of having to maneuver around like we had to do in universal analytics. And there's a new thing in here called Analytics Insights. And this is pretty cool.

[00:14:30.870] - Sherry
So, if you set it up, Google will let you know when things are happening on your site. So, for example, with Cub Scouts, my busy time is September, October, November, and almost every single day, especially in September. I'll get an email from Google that says, hey, your traffic has spiked. So, what they're doing is they're saying, okay, typically we expect Sherry to have this many sessions on her site. And you know what, she's had a lot more than that. So, it lets me know I've had a traffic spike.

[00:15:02.670] - Sherry
Now I have gotten the opposite, your traffic has decreased, which can be good. We want to make sure there's nothing wrong with our site if we get one of those. So that's just one example. There's lots of different insights that, you know, Google will notify us about.

[00:15:15.910] - Sherry
It's not all roses and rainbows. There are some things that are not so cool, and I want to go through these with you. First of all, it is built for ecommerce. It really is. So, there's going to be an awful lot of numbers that we don't need.

[00:15:28.960] - Sherry
The beautiful thing is you can create your reports, leave all that stuff out and you won't even see it. So that's a way to combat that. Can look overwhelming, and there is a learning curve. I mean, this is something we're all going to have to get used to. This is just one of those things we're going to need to get used to, because the more we dig into it and the quicker we get over that learning curve, the less overwhelming it's going to look, there are over 200 dimensions and metrics, but as bloggers, we're only going to need about 25 or 30 of them.

[00:15:59.370] - Sherry
Your numbers are not going to match UA. I wouldn't even try to figure it out, and there are a lot of reasons for that. Things are named differently. Things are not measured the same, like bounce rate. Bounce rate is totally different.

[00:16:13.270] - Sherry
The way things are collected is a little different. So, don't waste your time because you can go down that rabbit hole and spend way too many hours and have no answers. So, just don't even try to match those because they're not going to match. And I think another not so cool thing is there aren't as many predefined reports, and so we're going to have to build our own to get exactly what we need. We can do it.

[00:16:38.520] - Sherry
We can get through that. And then you've got it set.

[00:16:43.390] - Sherry
What should you do now? So, there's a few things that you need to do now. First of all, you want to set up a GA4 property, but do not delete UA. I have heard a couple of rumors that there are some folks out there saying, oh, don't install GA4 now, and that is absolutely the wrong advice. Please don't listen to that.

[00:17:03.360] - Sherry
And let me tell you why. Remember I mentioned that your UA numbers are not going to transfer over into GA4? Well, if you don't set up GA4 now, you're going to have zero historical data. If you set it up now, you'll at least have a little bit. So, I think I set mine up in March or April of 2022.

[00:17:23.010] - Sherry
So, I'm going to have a little bit over a year's worth of data that I can look at. But if you wait till June 30th to set up GA4, it's going to be like a clean slate, like you've got a brand new blog, and so you want to go ahead and set it up now. However, do not delete UA. Leave that alone. It is perfectly fine for both of those to run alongside each other, and it's not going to count duplicates.

[00:17:45.520] - Sherry
Nothing like that's going to happen. But just don't delete that. If you have an ad network, you definitely don't want to delete that. I know, my ad network, mediavine doesn't have everything set up for GA4 just yet. So, if you delete UA, it's going to impact your ad revenue.

[00:18:01.020] - Sherry
So make sure you set up GA4, but then leave Universal Analytics alone. The next thing you want to do is you want to make sure your enhanced measurements are turned on. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a little bit, but that just involves the things that it tracks. Some of the things that I mentioned earlier, you do have to have this turn on to be able to track. You want to connect your Google search console to GA4.

[00:18:27.100] - Sherry
This is not an automatic thing. Just like we had to set it up with UA, you have to set it up with GA4. And this is not required. This is just kind of a Sherry thing. Right now, the retention period is going to be defaulted to two months, and you can change it to 14 months.

[00:18:44.190] - Sherry
And personally, I want to have that 14 months. Now, this does not mean that you're only ever going to have 14 months of data. What this is, is this is a lot of the real specific stuff. You'll still have the high level page views and, you know, all those things. But the real specific stuff, if you don't set this to 14 months, you're only going to have two months of it.

[00:19:03.280] - Sherry
It doesn't hurt anything to go ahead and have 14 months. So, I would have it just in case you ever need to go back and really dig into some things.

[00:19:13.010] - Sherry
Okay, let's talk a little bit more about events. And as I go through this, I'll be giving you lots of examples of events. We mentioned earlier that this measures user interaction on a website or your app. So, there are four types of event categories in GA4, and the categories have to do with how they're collected. I wanted to let you know about this and give you some examples of exactly what events are.

[00:19:45.790] - Sherry
Okay, the first type of event is those that are automatically collected. We don't have to do anything for Google to record this information for us. And some of the examples of this are things like first visit, page views, session start, page title, page refer, you know, where they come from. So, those are some of the examples of automatically collected events. There's a whole lot more, but those are the ones that bloggers will be more focused on.

[00:20:12.940] - Sherry
Enhanced measurements. You do need to have enhanced measurements turned on. And a little bit later in the presentation, I'll tell you how you can get some information to check and make sure that yours are turned on. But some of the examples of this are the scrolls, outbound clicks, video engagement, file downloads. So, these are some things you definitely want to measure, and so you want to make sure that these are turned on.

[00:20:37.160] - Sherry
Now, Google does recommend some events. Most of these are for ecommerce and gaming. Like, I never thought about, you know, gaming companies wanting to keep track of all the stuff that they do. So, some of the events that Google recommends for those types of sites, and you all are going to laugh. I thought this was funny.

[00:20:54.480] - Sherry
If you earn or spend virtual currency in your game, if you watch a tutorial, the beginning and the end, if you request a refund, if you level up or unlock an achievement in your game, those are all recommended events for, you know, those types of websites. And then you can create custom events. Now to do a custom event, you are going to need to do either a little bit of coding or set it up in Google Tag Manager. But some examples of the types of things that you might want to set up is, let's say, you have a donate button on your blog. You can set that up to be a custom event and you can track that, a button that leads to a Contact Us page, a product rating.

[00:21:36.750] - Sherry
Those kinds of things are things that are custom events. And like I said, there's a little bit more set up involved in that. So, I don't know that very many of us will set up very many custom events. Now what events should bloggers focus on?

[00:21:51.450] - Sherry
Well, page views, obviously, sessions, engage sessions. That's something that I would encourage everyone to start monitoring, scroll and outbound clicks. So, those are the ones that I really think are important for Bloggers.

[00:22:09.340] - Sherry
Now I want to do a quick GA walk through for you. I'm not going to have time to do a very in depth walk through, but I am going to try to hit the highlights for you, so that you'll be able to see what's in there. Let me get over to that. We're looking at the facts vault, which is a new blog of mine, so I don't get a lot of traffic to it yet. Okay, on this homepage here, you got your menu over here that you can hover over and the menu is kind of what I would call like a two tier menu.

[00:22:41.710] - Sherry
So, some of these things, when you click on them, you're going to see more options. So, when I click on reports, it gives me, you know, more menu options here. Okay, I'm going to go back to home for a minute.

[00:22:56.590] - Sherry
You'll notice that things are in white boxes and those boxes are called cards.

[00:23:03.490] - Sherry
And these cards are kind of set up the same throughout all of GA4. So, when you look at like this overview card, you see a graph here and actually you see two lines on that graph. The solid blue line is the last seven days and the dotted blue line is the seven days prior to that. Let's say I go from users to new users. This graph is going to change to reflect this and you can tell which method you're looking at because it's got the blue line on the top.

[00:23:33.040] - Sherry
Down here, you've got your date ranges and you can change all that if you want to. And then you can also click here and go over to review your report snapshot. I'm not going to do that here, but I just know that there's more detail when you click that. This next card is your real time card. And the cool thing about real time is that it shows users in the last 30 minutes instead of the last five minutes, which is what we had in UA.

[00:23:59.590] - Sherry
The next thing on this homepage is something that I think is really kind of cool. What this does here is this shows you what you've recently viewed. So, let's say, you've looked at a particular thing. You can just click this box and will take you right back there. Now down here at the bottom, if you have insights and recommendations, you'll see those down here.

[00:24:19.270] - Sherry
I don't have any on this particular blog, but if I did, they would show up there. Okay, let's go look at reports. Now, one thing for you guys to know about reports is that some of them that you had in UA are not available anymore. Some of them have different names or they may be in different locations in GA4. Google tried to categorize these into, you know, things called content, lifecycle, search console user.

[00:24:48.370] - Sherry
Well, they didn't use these terms in UA. So, first time I opened it up, I was like, where in the world do I go to see which pages people have seen? So, you'll see that things are called different names. Now the beautiful thing about this is I can change the names of these.

[00:25:07.240] - Sherry
I can delete things off of here that I want to delete. I can add things on here that I want to add. I can change the names, I can rearrange stuff on here. Any of that stuff I can do, which I think is really pretty awesome. You do that through the use of this library down here.

[00:25:23.010] - Sherry
And I am not going to get into the library in this quickie overview, but just know that the library is where you can create new reports. You can add and subtract things from here, just all kinds of things like that to make this truly your own. I do want to look at page views really quickly though.

[00:25:43.990] - Sherry
This is showing me the pages. And one thing that you'll find in GA4 is that you'll see page title and screen class. Screen class is basically a page view on an app. So, we can see over here what people are looking at. And we've got a line graph and our bar chart here.

[00:26:02.220] - Sherry
And then down here is where we see more of what we were used to in universal analytics. Here's where you can change your rows per page. Let's see what else here. Up here at the top, we have our dates that we can change. And then here, you can click this little icon and you can customize this report.

[00:26:20.880] - Sherry
And let me just show you how easy this is. Let's say, I don't want this graph. This is just hard to read when you're looking by page views. So, what I can do is I can go over here to this line chart and I can go, and now it's gone. And then I can save this report, and I've got just what I want to look at.

[00:26:38.010] - Sherry
That's pretty cool, I think. I'm going to go back, not going to say that. Okay. 

[00:26:53.330] - Sherry
So, being able to customize this I think is really pretty awesome. So, our third option here in our main menu is the explore tab. And explore is where you can create your own reports. Well, I haven't created any for this particular site, so I'm going to click over to my analytics for Cub Scott ideas and show you explore on here. Okay. So, you can see here's where I created myself a report for outbound clicks and one for file downloads.

[00:27:24.400] - Sherry
But let me show you the outbound clicks really quickly.

[00:27:32.240] - Sherry
Your variables and tab settings are going to show up here by default, but you can just minimize those if you want to. I'm going to leave the variables open because that's where I changed the date. Let's see, and this is just for like almost the past month. But you can see this right here is actually a product that I made and that I sell on Etsy.

[00:27:49.970] - Sherry
So, I'm getting lots of clicks out to that. That's a good thing. And then you can see there's a YouTube. Some of these are reference guides that come from the Boy Scouts of America since I'm a Cub Scott blogger. And then we get into some of our affiliate links.

[00:28:03.070] - Sherry
This one, the tidd.ly is an etsy link. Here's an Amazon Link. Another Amazon Link. So, you can see where are people going, you know, where are they clicking to?

[00:28:15.440] - Sherry
Okay, let me go back over here too. I'm actually going to go back over here. In the Explore, there are different types of that you can use to create your reports. But to be honest with you, not sure that for bloggers or for most bloggers that we're going to be delving into some of this stuff to figure out actual things that we can do on our blog.

[00:28:35.740] - Sherry
So, what I would always do is start with this blank exploration and then you can build from there. This advertising tab is for people who pay Google to advertise their site. So, Amazon is probably going to do a lot of that. Sherry from Cub Scott Ideas is going to do none of that, so we can just ignore that.

[00:28:57.300] - Sherry
In the Configure tab, this is where we can create our own events or modify events. We can define what is considered a conversion. We can set up custom audiences if we want to. This is getting really kind of deep, but you may want to do some of that. Then we can also create some custom dimensions as well.

[00:29:16.330] - Sherry
Okay, I'm going to go back to home. But So that's our high level overview. Now I'm going to click and go back over to the presentation. I set up a page just for Blogger Breakthrough Summit attendees and it's at PainlessBlogAnalytics.com/BBS. And on there, I have videos that will show you how to set everything up.

[00:29:39.680] - Sherry
So, those [inaudible 00:29:40], make sure you got GA4 set up. There's a video on there to show you how to do that, how to check to make sure that all of your enhancements are turned on, how to connect Google Search console. You're going to find videos for all that on that page. The other thing that's on that page is your printable of dimensions and metrics that are important for bloggers. And then the last thing on there is a discount for my course, which is called the Data Driven Content Creators Guide to the New Google Analytics Store.

[00:30:08.180] - Sherry
I think if I probably tried, I could have made that name a little bit longer, but it's very descriptive. Anyway, that's my new course that I released recently, and that course is just for bloggers. I don't cover anything ecommerce. It is just for people who blog. And in there, you're going to find out how to create your own reports, how to customize those reports in much more detail.

[00:30:30.110] - Sherry
I'll also have some premade reports for you, and you might not even have to make your own. You can just use the one that I make for you. But there's a lot of good stuff in there that is going to help you get used to GA4, I have a discount for you on that page, so I hope you'll join me over in the course. All right. So, where do you find me if you have questions or need some help, you can find me on Instagram, Facebook, or you can always email me.

[00:30:56.960] - Sherry
Thanks so much for having me today. I hope that you found this presentation helpful, and I hope to see you in my course.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.370] - Sherry
Hey there. I'm Sherry Smothermon Short from Painless Blog Analytics. And first of all, I'd like to say a big thank you to Liz for asking me to participate in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I really appreciate the opportunity to share some information with you folks. Now, let me tell you a little bit about my background.

[00:00:30.750] - Sherry
I have been blogging for over a decade at Cub scot Ideas. I also have two other blogs, Easy Blog School and a new one called The Fax Fault. Before my blogging career, I worked for an auto insurance company. And as most of you probably know, in the insurance world, everything is kind of numbers driven, data driven, lots of analysis going on. And although I didn't do that kind of work for the insurance company, it sort of rubbed off a little bit on me as I was working with you know all the analysts and the folks who are really good at numbers.

[00:01:01.350] - Sherry
So, when I started blogging, I realized that there was quite a bit of information that's available for bloggers about their blog, and most of it is from free sources like Google Analytics and Google Search Console. But as I was learning about that and talking to much more experienced bloggers than me, I found out that most bloggers don't look at the numbers. They are confused by the numbers. They're not sure even if they know what they mean, they're not sure what they're supposed to do with them. They don't know how to make them actionable.

[00:01:32.620] - Sherry
So, I decided that I would start Painless Blog Analytics to help bloggers understand everything they need to know about their numbers. And you don't have to be a big numberish to be able to do this. A lot of it's really just looking at the information and drawn some conclusions from it. So, that's a little bit about me.

[00:01:55.350] - Sherry
So, let's go ahead and get started with our presentation. Let me make myself small here. Okay. What I'm going to share with you today is Five Actionable Google Analytics tricks. And the first one, I'm just going to kind of run through them really quickly, and then we'll dig into each one separately.

[00:02:13.680] - Sherry
The first one is determine when you have most visitors to your site. The second thing I'm going to show you is how to identify why traffic to a specific blog post spiked. The third trick is I'm going to show you how to compare traffic sources to determine which one is responsible for lower traffic. Trick number four is identify blog posts that are doing well from one traffic source, but not from another. And trick number five is I'm going to show you how to create and track a campaign URL and also explain you what a campaign URL actually is.

[00:02:46.830] - Sherry
Okay, so let's jump in. And I told you guys I blogged at Cub scot ideas, and that's the account that I'm going to use here for the examples today, is my account, my Google Analytics account for. Okay. The first thing I want to talk to you about is determining when you have the most visitors to your website.

[00:03:09.650] - Sherry
It's actually right here on the home page in Analytics. And if you look over here, you see this little chart. When do your visitor users visit? Well, if you look over here, we've got the times of the day, and then we've got the days of the week. And you can tell about the little scale here that the darker blue is when you have more people on your site and lighter blue is when you have fewer people on your site, you can change the time frame.

[00:03:36.650] - Sherry
If you wanted to look at seven days, the last 30 days, you can do a custom time frame, but we're just going to leave it here. Now, why is it important to know this and what kind of action can you take knowing this information? Well, the first thing that you can do is when you see that you've got some of the darker blue here, that's when you want to publish your new blog post. And the reason for that is that if you've got people on your site already, if you publish a new post, you're getting a lot of eyeballs.

[00:04:07.310] - Sherry
You're going to get a lot of eyeballs on that blog post right away.

[00:04:11.650] - Sherry
So, if I were looking at this, my traffic usually comes on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and then kind of slows off for the rest of the week. But what I would do is I would probably publish my blog post late in the afternoon on Monday, like 3 or 4 'o' clock on Monday afternoon. Now, something that you don't want to do when you have a lot of traffic on your site is you don't want to update your blog or your WordPress. Let's say there's some plugins that need to be updated or you need to update your WordPress or platform or your theme.

[00:04:46.950] - Sherry
You don't want to do it when you have a lot of people on your site.

[00:04:49.590] - Sherry
Now, if you're just doing little updates, this might not happen, but I would still wait and do your updates when you don't have much traffic. You run the risk when you do that of having this message show up, briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. And we sure don't want that showing up on our blocks when you have a lot of people on your site. So, do those do updates during the lighter blue and publisher blog post during the darker blue. Okay, so go back. That is showing you how when you have the visitors of what you can do from that.

[00:05:28.630] - Sherry
Okay. So the next thing I want to show you is how to identify what caused a traffic spike to a particular blog post. And what we are going to do with that is we're going to go over here to behavior, site content, all pages. Now, what this is showing you is let me move myself out of the way there. What this is showing you is your traffic by pages, by individual or actually blog posts, and then it shows your graph here.

[00:06:02.680] - Sherry
I've got this set up for, by day, so I can look at everything by day. Now let me show you what I wanted to show you on this. I'm going to pick out a specific blog post. I have a blog post on Cub scot ideas called how to make armpit fudge. Sounds really disgusting, but it is actually kind of fun and the kids love making it.

[00:06:26.140] - Sherry
So anyway, there you have it. Okay. So what I'm going to do with this blog post is I want to see, you know did I have any traffic spikes here? And if I did, what cost them? So, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to change the date now, as you probably know that typically this is defaulted to seven days, the last seven days.

[00:06:48.230] - Sherry
But for this particular instance, I had it starting at the beginning of the year, but I want to go way way back. I want to see how far I can go back. Like I don't remember what year I published this blog post. We're going to say January 1, 2014 through November 14, 2021. Okay.

[00:07:09.290] - Sherry
And it looks like I published it even before that. Let's go back one more year.

[00:07:18.670] - Sherry
Alright. And you can see it looks like that sometime in June of 2013 was when I originally published this blog post. Okay. So, as you can see, we have these little spikes here. And what I'm going to do, though, is I'm going to take this down to 2015, I think.

[00:07:42.610] - Sherry
Yeah.

[00:07:47.010] - Sherry
Just makes it a little bit easier to see. So, I want to find out what caused these spikes here. There had to be something that caused my traffic to jump up that much. And when you hover over the blue line here, you can see that the date shows up. So, if I hover over and sometimes it's kind of hard to get it right on the actual spike.

[00:08:10.210] - Sherry
But once you can get on there, you see the little blue dot behind my cursor. And this is that this is Saturday, May 6, 2017. So, I'm going to write that down. Then I could also check some of these other little spikes, but I want to check just the bigger ones. Okay.

[00:08:26.920] - Sherry
So, when I hover over this one, it's Saturday, April 25, 2020. And then let's look at this one too. This one is going to be one. I might have trouble getting it right on the date.

[00:08:52.870] - Sherry
Sorry about that. Like I mentioned this, sometimes, it can be kind of hard to get it right on there. And I think this is February 2nd. Okay, so we could adjust to see that February 2nd. I could change the dates here and just make this for this year.

[00:09:14.270] - Sherry
And then it's a lot easier to figure out what this spike is. Tuesday, February 2. Okay. Anyway, I just wanted to show you how you could do that and look at that a little bit more carefully. So, let's go.

[00:09:25.580] - Sherry
We wrote down May 6, 2017, that was the first spike that we had to this blog post. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put May 6 of 2017, and then I'm going to do May 6 of 2017. I just want the data for that day. Okay. So, we've got it here.

[00:09:48.480] - Sherry
And of course, you don't have a chart because you're only looking at one day. But what we're going to do is we're going to go down here to secondary dimension. We're going to click on that and we're going to type in source medium. And actually, if you just start typing, it'll show up and you can pick the option. Now, what this is going to do is this is going to add where the traffic came from.

[00:10:10.300] - Sherry
And I can see that on that day on May 6 of 2017, I posted about this on Facebook and you can see how much the traffic spiked. I got 70% of my traffic that day came from Facebook. So, my takeaway from this is you know what? I think I need to publish this post on Facebook again. And anytime you need a traffic jump for that post, you can do that as well.

[00:10:35.160] - Sherry
Okay. Now let's go look at the second date was April 21 of 2020.

[00:10:53.470] - Sherry
Okay, here we go. I still have my source medium selected. And you can see on this date, I sent out an email with the Armpit Budge link in it. I'll put that out here in a minute. So, I might want to make sure that I send out this blog post in email. So that's another way that we can get some extra traffic to a particular blog post.

[00:11:18.550] - Sherry
Now, the last date that we're going to look at is we're going to look at February 2nd of 2021.

[00:11:38.570] - Sherry
Okay. And when we look at that date, I can see that my spike came from Google. I have no idea why. On that particular day, we have lots of extra people coming to visit my site from Google. 

[00:11:53.130] - Sherry
So, there's really not a lot of action that I can take on this particular one. But hopefully you can see how looking at this, you can go back, you can do an email, you can do a Facebook post wherever the traffic came from. Repeat that again. Okay. So that is our second trick.

[00:12:16.710] - Sherry
Now, on our third trick, we are going to compare traffic sources to determine which one is responsible for lower traffic. So, let's say that our traffic has dropped off a little bit and we're not quite sure why is it Pinterest? Are we losing Pinterest traffic? Is it Google traffic? What are we losing here?

[00:12:38.070] - Sherry
So the way that we look at that is we are going to go to acquisition all traffic, and then we are going to go to channels first. I think sometimes I look at channels. Sometimes I look at source medium and I need to change the state because we don't want to look at just one day on this.

[00:13:13.030] - Sherry
Okay.

[00:13:16.910] - Sherry
In the other little trick, we wanted to look at this by day, but for this one, we want to look at this by month. It's a little easier to see the graph and what's happening with your traffic this way. And one little trick, in case you didn't know this is defaulted to users, I can change that to sessions, anything. I want to change it to sessions.

[00:13:37.320] - Sherry
I'm going to change that possession. Now down here we have our traffic sources. We have organic traffic and social. So, I'm going to click both of these little boxes over here on the side. And then I'm going to click plot rows.

[00:13:53.150] - Sherry
And what happens is it's going to show you your traffic like the orange line is going to be your organic traffic and the green line is going to be your social traffic. And you can see that the social traffic is pretty much the same. It looks like it might have gone up a little bit in September, but that's fairly flat. The orange line, though, is where I'm getting a lot of my traffic. And just so you know, the reason I have like, this big spike here is because this is September, October, and those are the two months that I get.

[00:14:27.750] - Sherry
A lot more traffic comes out ideas. Okay. So for this, there's not really a lot that I can do with this. You know this is following this curve. I might work a little bit more on Pinterest here and maybe see if I can grow that a little bit more.

[00:14:46.070] - Sherry
But for the most part, this is not something that I can do a lot with. Now let me show you one other thing, though. Let's unclick these. And I'm going to click into Social, and then we can see Pinterest and Facebook and I'm going to plot those rows. And you can see the same thing going on here. Now I'm going to show you some, actually, some screenshots from a couple of my clients that I want to show you, grayed out their information, so you don't know who it is.

[00:15:24.430] - Sherry
But the reason I wanted to show you these is because these give you a little bit more of hey, this is something I can take action on.

[00:15:32.570] - Sherry
So with this client, their social traffic took a pretty big nosedive there, and their organic search traffic took a pretty big jump. So, with this situation, I continue doing whatever they're doing and maybe even ramp it up. Maybe they're updating old blog posts, something like that. So continue doing whatever they've been doing to make this organic search stay, you know keep trending upwards.

[00:15:58.690] - Sherry
And then I might dig a little bit into my social traffic and see, you know did I change something in my Pinterest strategy or my Facebook strategy, or is this just the nasty Pinterest algorithm? What is this that cause this? That's something that I would do with this particular account. So, with this account, what we're seeing here is that the lines are fairly close to each other, but they're kind of cross and then looks like they might be crossing back again. So, with this, I would probably again check and see what's going on here to make the social traffic drop off a little bit and then just kind of continue with the search.

[00:16:45.220] - Sherry
Now, one thing I wanted to mention to you if you see the date here is January 1st through November 13 on this particular screenshot, and I haven't defaulted two months here. It's really easy to forget that we're looking at, that we're only seeing November numbers through about the middle of the month, and it looks like, oh, my goodness, the traffic just took a terrible nosedive in November. Well, it didn't really, because this is just two weeks that we're looking at here where all these other points are an entire month's worth of data.

[00:17:18.720] - Sherry
So, I just wanted to mention that to you because I know that can be a little bit confusing. Okay, so our fourth trick is to identify blog posts that are doing well from one traffic source, but not from another.

[00:17:33.630] - Sherry
Okay. I'm going to go back over here to my account and going to go back to behavior, site content, all pages.

[00:17:45.130] - Sherry
Now, in this particular instance, I want to show you my results for one specific blog post. And instead of going down through here and I could go down through here and look for the different you know look for that URL, I could search. I could show more rows and look for it. But what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to search and you don't have to put the whole thing in there. I'm looking for a blog post about robots.

[00:18:10.660] - Sherry
I'm just going to put robot in there. And then you can see, I actually have a robotics tag. And then I have two robot post, one's about making a robot hand, and one's about making a robot out of a toothbrush, which is kind of a fun project. Okay. So, I'm going to click on this because this is the one I want to look at.

[00:18:30.670] - Sherry
And then how to make the Cub Scot robots with toothbrushes. I'm going to add my source medium again and then I want to look and see. Okay. In this particular instance, I'm getting almost 55% of my traffic from Pinterest and only 18% from Google. So, what we want to do here is we want to find out how much traffic my site as a whole gets from Pinterest, and the reason for that is just so we can have some comparison.

[00:19:06.250] - Sherry
So again, let's remember that Pinterest was about 55% of the traffic for this blog post, and Google search was about 18%. This time, I'm going to go back to acquisition. I'm going to go to all traffic and I'm going to click source medium. And we can see here that my Google traffic for my site as a whole is 63% yet on that one blog post, it was only 18%. So that says to me that I probably need to work on that post some more in Google like, I need to work on the SEO and see if I can get that search traffic up.

[00:19:47.510] - Sherry
There's something missing with that particular post.

[00:19:50.070] - Sherry
I mean, I'm glad it's doing well on Pinterest. I just want it to do just as well on Google as well. You can do this with any of your blog posts. Take a look at it, compare it, compare it to what your site as a whole is doing and then decide what your action needs to be from there. Now let's talk about our last actionable Google Analytics trick, and it is to create and track a campaign URL.

[00:20:13.130] - Sherry
And I want to start by telling you a little bit about what a campaign URL is. A campaign URL will show you more specifically where that traffic came from. This is beyond just the source medium that we normally get. There are some services that you may use that already have added a campaign URL for their link. This could be things like your email service provider, your social share buttons, or even tailwind.

[00:20:39.630] - Sherry
If you use tailwind for Pinterest. Now I want to show you some examples. I'm already in acquisition, but now I'm going to go down to campaign, all campaigns. And I'm going to show more than just the ten that are there. And you can see that I've got here's tailwind, tailwind. Grow is my social share button. These are titles of emails that I sent out so you can see all the different ways that people got to my website.

[00:21:11.330] - Sherry
In addition to these automated campaign URLs showing up in your Google Analytics, you can also create your own. And let me tell you when you might want to do that. Let's say you wanted to try to do some manual pinning, and you just wanted to see, you know do I get any traffic from those manual pins? Do I get more than I get from regular pins you know what that are scheduled? What are the results of that? So, I did that a couple of years ago and I came up with this very brilliant campaign name of Fall 29 pin man, which for me means pinning manually.

[00:21:50.490] - Sherry
So what I did was I put the campaign URL that had this campaign on it as the link on those pins that I was pinning manually. Now another one that we did that was manual, the person who does my Pinterest did some video pins for me back in 2019 was the first time I'd had video pins on my Pinterest account. So, I decided to make a special URL for those that included this on it Fall 2019 Pin man. And you can see that's actually done pretty well.

[00:22:25.210] - Sherry
This was two years ago when I created this and I'm still getting traffic now. Another good way to use a campaign URL is if you do Web stories.

[00:22:35.890] - Sherry
Now I actually wrote a blog post just last week about the analytics around what web stories that's on my pinlist blog analytics blog. So, feel free to hop over there and take a look at that. There are a few things that you need to be aware of just in terms of how to track those things. So, let's say you do want you. We're going to create a story and we want to track that story with the campaign URL.

[00:22:57.420] - Sherry
Now let me show you how you build that. What you're going to do is just search for campaign URL builder. It has kind of a funky URL, so I would never be able to remember that. So just search for this and when you pull it up, you can see it's a Google analytics product. Now, there are four pieces of information that are required to create a campaign URL.

[00:23:21.150] - Sherry
Excuse me. You need to know the website URL. You need to know the campaign source, the campaign medium and the campaign name. Source and medium need to be whatever Google is already using for that. Now I know that for web stories, Google is using Discover as the source and organic as the medium. Campaign name can be anything that you want it to be to help you remember. You could do get really fancy with the naming like I did with that 2019 you know Pin Man, or you can do whatever you want to do there.

[00:23:51.350] - Sherry
So, let's say we're going to do a story about this blog post here, which is the Alpha Seltzer Rockets that I made with film canisters. I'm going to copy that. I'm going to pop back over here to the campaign builder, and I'm going to put that in here. And like I said, the campaign source is going to be discover and the campaign medium is organic. These are case sensitive.

[00:24:14.040] - Sherry
So, you want to make sure that you do all lower case here. If you do uppercase, you're going to wind up with two different source slash mediums, one with Discover with the capital D and one with Discover with the lowercase d. Now the campaign name. What I've decided to do as I start to do more stories is I'm going to do a WS dash at the beginning just to let me know that that's a web story. And then I'm going to do let's see Canister rocket, and it needs to be all you know smooth together.

[00:24:44.650] - Sherry
It doesn't need to have a space in there.

[00:24:46.330] - Sherry
Now, if you look down here at the bottom, we've got the URL sources, discover medium is organic and the campaign is this was-canister rocket. So, I'm going to copy that and let me pop into the this is the Google Web Stories plugin editor, and I want to show you where you would put this. Okay. So, where you would put this is in the page attachment on your design. So that's where you're going to put this URL over here.

[00:25:18.270] - Sherry
Now, another place that you might want to put this URL is let's say I have, I decided to make this text be a hyperlink. You can see right there add link. I would want to make sure that I did a campaign URL for that as well. So, after you've got that finished, then you know this will track exactly which web story your traffic is coming from. You may say, but Sherry, if you do a web story about a Canister Rockets and you have traffic that's coming from Discover Organic to the Al Consults or Rockets blog post, it's pretty evident that it came from the web story.

[00:25:59.920] - Sherry
That's right. But let me show you something that it doesn't tell you. And I'm going to find there's a specific email that I sent out. I sent this email out about a month or so ago, and it was for a blog post that I have where I have some printable word search puzzles for Cub Scots. Now, the only links that I put in this email were to my home page and to the page that actually has the word search puzzles on there.

[00:26:27.860] - Sherry
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a secondary dimension of page and you can see you have two options here. Landing page is just the very first page that they landed on when they came over to your site, where page will tell you anywhere else that they happen to visit after they came over from that email. So, let me show you. Okay. I'm going to

[00:26:55.880] 
3.Show a few more rows and you can see that most of the people came over and they landed on the blog post with the puzzles.

[00:27:07.270] - Sherry
Then I had some people that came to my home page. But then look at this. All of these others are pages on my blog that people visited. So, maybe they came to the puzzle maker post and then they popped over to my find the hidden object activity or to the kids fingerprint activity. But they're visiting more than just these two things.

[00:27:28.960] - Sherry
So that's why it's really good to know this. Now I'm going to scroll down and you can see the people that came from that email over to my site and wound up visiting 137 different pages or posts on my blog. So, the way I would make this actionable is pop in some of these. If you find one that seems to be pretty successful, there's actually a couple of things you can do. You could say, okay, I need to send out another blog post, not blog post.

[00:27:59.740] - Sherry
I need to send out another email with the links to this particular blog post, the one with the search puzzles on there. And hopefully, you'll get the same results of people visiting lots of other places on your site. Now, the second thing that you can do with this information is you know look at some of these emails, and if you find some like this one that's got 137 different places that people visited, pop into that blog post and examine it. And see what am I doing in that blog post that I might not be doing in others?

[00:28:31.950] - Sherry
Do I have lots of links out to other places on my blog? Is that what causing people to stop there and then visit other things?

[00:28:40.690] - Sherry
So, if you find that's the case, then you know, go into some of your other blog posts and add some more links to it. Okay. So that brings us to the end of our five actionable Google Analytics tricks. I hope this has been helpful to you guys. I will be in the Facebook group for the Summit.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.080] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Hey there. I'm Sherry Smotherman-Short from Painless Blog Analytics. And I want to start by telling Liz a big thank you for inviting me to join your Blogger Breakthrough Summit again this year. Liz, thank you so much. Now, if we've not met, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I've been blogging at Cub Scout Ideas for over a decade now. And before that, I worked for an auto insurance company. And while I was there, I wasn't on the analysis side of things. I didn't do anything with data, but I did hang out with a lot of people who were and worked with a lot of them on lots of different projects. I feel like it rubbed off on me a little bit. When I started my blog, Cub Scout Ideas in, I think it was 2012, I found out that I could get information for free from Google Analytics that told me what was going on with my blog. I started digging into that and figuring out ways that I could apply what I saw to help me grow my traffic so that I could get to the point where my blog made money for me.

[00:01:09.550] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
As the years went by, I met lots of other bloggers, including some that were substantially larger blogs than mine. I would talk to them about Google Analytics. And what I found out was that a lot of people didn't even look at their analytics. And if they did, it was a quick let me jump in, grab a number or two and jump out because I just can't handle all those numbers. I don't know what they mean. They don't make sense to me. Because of that, and I was thinking, Man, these folks are very successful and they're not really using those analytics. That's when I decided to start Painless Blog Analytics. Now, what I do at Painless Blog Analytics is I help experienced bloggers use their data to grow and improve their blogs. Today, we're going to learn about the dollars in your data, maximizing your blog revenue using your analytics. What we'll do is I'm going to walk you through some things in Google Analytics for showing you where things are and all that. Then I'm going to explain what some of the data means, and then I'm going to give you some ideas of ways that you can use that data to improve your blogs.

[00:02:16.800] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's go ahead and get started. Let me minimize myself. I'm going to be using my Cubs Scout ideas, Google Analytics 4 account. First, we're going to look at your blog posts that have the most traffic. I'm going to tell you a little bit about some of the things that you can do there. We're going to go to Reports. And when you're here, you guys won't have blogging reports because that's something that I created myself. But you may have either business objectives or life cycle. These are called collections. Now, within each of the collections, you're going to have topics. We've got generate leads, we've got acquisition. And then within each of those, you're going to see reports. So collections, topics, reports. You may have both of these collections or you may have one or the other. These are generic collections that Google created for us. What we're looking for here is we are looking for your Pages and screens report. And you can find that report in both of these menus. These are just menus over here. If I look under business objectives, it is going to be in the raise brand awareness topic pages and screens, or if I look in lifecycle, it's going to be in engagement pages and screens.

[00:03:37.860] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And both of those are going to take us to the exact same report. I am not a big fan of these charts and graphs up here. They only talk about your top five blog posts. And to me, that's just not valuable information to having a chart. I'm going to just scroll past that. Let me move myself over here. And then what I'm going to do here is right now I can see my top 10 blog posts. I want to change that to 25. That'll show us 25 rows here. Let's talk a little bit about what we're going to do here. We are going to go through these blog posts and we're going to think about what is the question or problem that this blog post answers are solved. In SEO, we call this search intent. Basically, we are going to try to figure out what the search intent was behind the search that got the people to this blog post. I'm going to start with my very top blog post here. It is that my Cub Scout uniform patch placement post. It's basically, we're on the little kid's uniform do you put these patches? And that has been my number one post for quite some time now.

[00:04:51.080] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And I want us to stop and think, why would somebody be looking for this? Why would somebody wind up on this blog post? Well, it's because they don't know where to put the patches. If those Cubs Scout parents are like me, it's an hour before we have to leave to go to a meeting. And my kids come running in and saying, Mom, you never sewed these patches on and I want to wear them tonight. And so it's a frantic look for it. So my search intent was I need to know where to place these patches on the uniform. I've answered that question in this post, but now I want you to think about what's the next thing that my audience might ask or what's the next problem they might have once I've solved this problem for them? Think about that. What comes next? And for this, it's okay, now that I know where to put them, how do I sew them on? They're not the most easy things to sew on, and they are not iron on. When I realized that a few years ago, I wrote a blog post called How to Sew on your patches easily.

[00:05:48.700] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
These are companion blog posts. This is solving the next problem that they might have. And as you can see, it's in my top 10 now as well. When you're going through here and you're thinking about these things, I want you to think, What else can I help this person with that I could write a complementary blog post about? Because that's one of the ways that you can grow your traffic. You may just wind up having something show up in your top 10 like I did here. After you've gone down through here to figure out what other blog posts can I write that would be the next best step or the answer to the next question, I want you to look at the types of posts that you've written. I have several on here that are list posts. For example, this Cub Scout gifts is a list post. The Stocking Stuffers is a list post. 10 Knot Tying Games, 15 awesome Cub Scout leader gifts. I have quite a few list posts here. What other kinds of lists do I think my audience might be interested in? Think about that. Then think, are there other types of posts on here?

[00:06:52.260] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's see. This first aid kits is an activity. They're going to make their own little first aid kit. This recycled or rain gutter regatta boat, they're actually making little boats out of recycled materials. That's an activity. Making the handmade hiking sticks is an activity. Making armpit fudge is an activity. My audience likes these kinds of activities. Again, think about what other kinds of activities can I give them. Those are the things that I would recommend that you do when you are looking at pages and screen to try to increase your traffic. What else can I give them? And give them that because you're going to find out that some of those are going to be very successful for you. Next, we are going to stay on this same page and we're going to add the secondary dimension of source medium. In Universal Analytics, it actually said secondary dimension. But here we just hit to click this plus sign and then we're going to search for source medium. I will tell you that there are three versions of source medium in GA4. We're only seeing two here. We're seeing first user and session source medium. There is also one that is just plain source medium.

[00:08:05.870] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
They are three very different measures. This first user is just like it sounds. It is the first time somebody comes to your site, this gets recorded. It does not take into account where people are coming from if they're coming back to your site. Now, the third one that's just plain source medium, you don't see on this list because it's not applicable here, but that is when there is some conversion on your site, usually something involving money. We're going to ignore that. The one that we want is the session source medium because it's the closest to what we had in Universal Analytics. Now we've got our source medium over here. What I want us to do is go down through, and maybe we don't do all 25, but we might want to do the top 10 blog posts this way. What I want you to do is filter down so that we just see this particular blog post. We're going to highlight it, copy it. And then here's a search bar here. We're going to paste it here. We're going to click Enter to search for it. Now we can see all of the different places that sent me traffic to this blog post here.

[00:09:13.640] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
What we're doing here is going to look at how much traffic we're getting from our top source, which in my case is Google. And then we're going to go down and say, Okay, let's look at something like email. I don't have a lot of traffic from emails to this blog post. Maybe it's because I'm not sharing this blog post in enough of my emails. Maybe I should even put it toward the bottom and just always have it in there. That might be something that I want to do, especially if this is a high RPM post. I might want to look and see, Okay, maybe I need to share this more often on Facebook because I'm only getting 75 visits. There's a few more because the way Google tracks these source mediums, they're not all exactly the same. We see that a lot, or more so with Pinterest than we do with Facebook, but we do see it with Facebook. But even if you add up the two or three Facebooks that I have here, it's still about 100. Same thing with Pinterest, maybe a little bit over 100 compared to 5,200. When I see that I'm getting very little traffic from these other sources compared to what I'm getting from Google, it tells me that something's not quite right with my strategy.

[00:10:22.020] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's just take Pinterest, for instance. I need to dig into Pinterest and find out what's going on. Maybe it's been a really long time since I've pinned this post. Maybe I need to create a new pin with a different format, maybe different colors, different fonts, different wording. Maybe I need to do something like that. Or maybe I'd need to go into Pinterest and search for Cub Scout Uniform Patch Placement and see what comes up. If there are pins from other blogs that have similar posts, I need to examine those and just see how do their pins compare to mine. But I definitely need to dig into what's going on for this blog post with these other sources. Next, we need to talk about engagement rate. Let me explain what engagement rate is before we jump in to find an engagement rate on our reports. For a session to be considered engaged, one of three things needs to happen. Either the person needs to stay on your site 10 seconds or longer, or they need to visit two or more pages, or there needs to be some conversion event. Now, a lot of us don't sell anything, so there wouldn't be any monetary conversion, and we may not have other types of conversion set up.

[00:11:33.250] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
We're just going to focus on the first two: on staying on your site for 10 seconds or longer and on the visiting two or more pages. Another thing that you need to know about engagement rate is that bounce rate now is the inverse of engagement rate. Let's say I have 100 sessions and 75 of them are considered engaged because somebody stayed on the blog 10 seconds or longer or visited two or more page views. If 75 is my engagement rate, the percentage of the sessions that were engaged, my bounce rate is going to be 25 %. It's all the unengaged sessions, I guess you could say. Again, bounce rate is the inverse of engagement rate. Let's find our engagement rate. We're going to stay on this page that are pages and screens, but we're going to make a couple of changes. We're going to get rid of that search, and then we're going to get rid of our secondary dimension. What we need to do is to add our engagement rate. The way that we're going to do that is go here under Customize Report, then we are going to go to Metrics. Our engagement rate is a metric, so we're going to add the metric.

[00:12:45.300] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And the way we do that is by clicking down here in the Add metric box. And we can just start typing engagement rate and then you'll see it pop up and we can select it. And then we're going to move this to the top. I'm just going to grab those six dots and drag it up here and drop it. Actually, we're going to make that engagement rate first. Then we're going to click Apply. And then we want to save this. I'm going to save this as a new report. I'm going to click Save. And then we can go back. Now that we've got engagement rate on here, we don't want to sort by engagement rate, and let me tell you why. This blog post here has gotten two visits and it's considered 100% engaged. That is meaningless when you've only had two views to the page. We're going to hover over here. If you look just to the left of Views, you see that little gray down arrow. We're going to click on the app and that's going to sort it in descending order by our page views. I'm going to give myself 50 rows here.

[00:13:55.470] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And I'm looking for two things. I'm looking for a blog post with a low engagement rate and a blog post with a high engagement rate. I'm going to just start scrolling down through here. I'm going to skip my homepage and I'm going to skip any category and tag pages. Let's just keep scrolling down. Let's choose this handmade hiking sticks for our high engagement rate post. And then let's see. And we're going to use this kids' fingerprint activity for our low engagement post. Now, what I want you to do once you identify those things is open each of those in a separate tab. You'll have both of them open so you can look at both of them. What we're looking for when we have those two posts open is what are the differences between the two? What do we have in that high engagement post, the hiking stick post that makes people stick around or visit two or more pages that we don't have in the fingerprint activity? Or what do we have in the fingerprint activity that we don't have in the hiking stick activity that we might need to delete out? We're just going to do a comparison.

[00:15:04.620] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's start at the top and just review these two posts. Does one of them have a paragraph before they have a picture and one doesn't have that? Does the paragraph say something like, use this fingerprint activity for your cub scouts, where the hiking stick one may say something like, Your cub scouts are going to love making their own hiking sticks that they can actually use or even give as a gift. Think about, is that more compelling than the wording that's in that first paragraph? Think about that. What am I saying at the beginning that's going to make somebody want to look down through there and stay on that blog post a little bit longer? Then I want you to look at where your links are. If one of the blog posts has some internal links pretty high up on the page and the other one doesn't, maybe you need to add some more links closer to the top for that one because it may be that people are saying, Well, this blog post is not for me, but man, look at this. It looks like I can click over and learn about this other activity that I may be more interested in.

[00:16:07.150] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Compare those two blog posts and figure out what do you need to do. This is going to be a lot of trial and error on your part. And what works for my blog is not going to work for your blog. That's one of my pet peeves because somebody will come along and say, Oh, you must do this to be successful on your blog, or This is the only way to grow your blog. Okay, but that might not work for your specific and your specific voice and your specific blog. So you have to try things. Try them out. If it works, great. If it doesn't, revert back to what you had and try something else. This is going to be trial and error for you. The last thing that we're going to look at is our social media traffic. Let me show you what we're going to do here. We're going to stay on this page, path, and screen class, but I want us to add a secondary dimension, again, session source medium. Of course, this is all of our traffic. What we need to do is filter this down so that we just have traffic from one social media platform.

[00:17:07.810] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
The way we want to do the filtering is go over here to where you have customized report, click on the pencil. Then right here you can see this says report filter, and we're going to add a filter. What I want you to do is click on that and in the select dimension, we're going to search for session source medium. And we're going to say that we want to find a session source medium that contains, and then you type in the name of your social media platform. I'm going to do Facebook. We'll do that first and we'll also do Pinterest. One thing to note is that this is case-sensitive. And if you put a capital F, you're probably going to get no traffic. Make sure that this is lowercase. I'm going to click Apply. And then I'm going to save this. Since this is already a copy, I'm just going to save my changes to my current report. Then I'm going to click the back button. I'm not quite sure why, but Google switches this from page path to page title. I don't like to see the title. I want my page path. All you have to do is click this down arrow and click page path and screen class, and then it goes right back to what we had.

[00:18:28.920] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
It also sorts it by engagement rate again and I want to sort it by views. I'm just going to click that. I want to see what has happened over time. I can compare date ranges, just like we did in Universal, by clicking up here in this little date range up here. And then you have to scroll down a little bit and then you'll see Compare. And all we have to do is turn on the compare. As you can see, this is comparing the very last 28 days to the 28 days before that. Now you need to decide if that makes sense for your blog. It does not make sense for Cub Scout Ideas because Cub Scout Ideas is very cyclical. And so it's hard for me to compare month over month. What is much better for me is to compare year over year. What I'm going to do, instead of comparing it to the preceding period, I'm going to look at the same period last year. I'm going to click that and then I'm going to click Apply. We really want to look here at this Views column, but we want to see what has happened last year for this time frame compared to this year.

[00:19:34.080] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Now, there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind when you're looking at this. The first thing is when did you install GA4 on your site? If you're seeing all zeroes for the prior year, it probably means that you did not install GA4 until less than 13 months ago. Keep that in mind if you're seeing a lot of zeroes, know that eventually you'll be able to use this process, but you might not be able to use it right now if you're looking at year-over-year numbers. The second thing I want you to look at is the actual numbers. For some of these, depending on how big your blog is, the numbers may be relatively small. If I look at this, there's only a 22-view difference here. And you can see it's a small percentage as well. I don't want to make an action plan if I'm looking at 22 more views. Keep that in mind. Now, we're going to go down through and I'm going to point out some things to you. You're just examining your data. There's no hard and fast rules, but you're just examining your data and trying to figure out what could I do with this.

[00:20:40.830] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
I can see my service project ideas post did pretty well. Look at here. Last year, I had zero visits to this blog post from Facebook for this time frame. That probably means I did not share on Facebook about my blog post. I need to do that. This is actually something that is evergreen. And it should probably be in my rotation of blog post that get thrown on Facebook at least once a month. I'm going to write myself a note that every month I need to include this blog post in my Facebook postings. This one is a seasonal blog post. It's a little gift exchange story. It's actually pretty funny. But last year, I only got two visits, so I may not have even posted that at all during this time frame. This is one that during the holiday season, probably starting mid-October, I need to make sure that I'm sharing this maybe once a week. Let's keep going. Here's another evergreen post that I didn't post last year. Now we get down here and we see that there's a negative number here by a hiking stick post. When I look at this, I might think, Oh, my goodness, I need to do something because look at that, I dropped 13 %.

[00:22:05.010] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
But again, this is where those numbers come into play. You're talking a difference of nine views. I probably don't want to change any strategy over a nine-view difference. Now, if 13 % were 900, absolutely. Or even 90, absolutely. It depends on the size of your blog and what the pure numbers are. I'm just going to go down through here and look at this and see what do I need to do. I'm going to make sure my lefty Elf post is shared on Facebook at least once a week until the end of the year. That's something I'm going to take action on right away. Others of these, I may not do anything this year, but I may put it on the schedule to make sure that I post it next year during this time. Again, you're going to look at some things, you're going to make some notes, some things you may take action on now, some things you may add to your content calendar for next year. Let's look at Pinterest. I'm going to go into that customized report again, remove the filter by clicking the X. I wish there were a way we could just update the filter, but unfortunately, we can't.

[00:23:16.780] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
We have to start again. We're going to click Add Filter, click in the box again, and this is session source medium. Add that. We're going to say contains. Now we're going to say Pinterest. Don't forget that needs to be all lowercase and click Apply. I'm going to save the changes to this report. I'm going to go back. Then I'm going to make sure that I'm sorting by my views here. We can see that I've had a substantial uptick in Pinterest traffic this year versus last year. Now let's go down through here and see. Are there any negative numbers? With this increase, there may not be any negative numbers, but we may see some that have grown quite a bit less than 75 %. Let's scroll down through here and let's see. This one's only a 15 % increase. Now, this is my homepage. And to be honest with you, I'm not sure if I have many, if any, pins that just go to my homepage, but maybe I need to make some. Now, here's one that dropped, Cub Scout service project ideas. This should be one that I should be doing better on. Again, I'm going to put this on my list of blog posts that I need to either make new pins for, pin more often, whatever it is that you're going to do there.

[00:24:42.920] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Again, I'm just going to go down through here. I'm going to pick out some blog post that it looks like I need to do something with, and then you wind up having some actions that you can take. You're going to have to test things to see what is going to move needle for your blog. Now, there's one more thing I want to show you on here. Remember I told you earlier that I didn't like these graphs up here because I just don't think they give you good information? I might look at this and think, Oh, my goodness, my Pinterest traffic totally went away for these four days. Well, no, it didn't. What happened here is that your top five posts took a little dip. And that's all this is reflecting. This is not reflecting everything over your blog as a whole. Just keep that in mind when you're looking at these, you might want to ignore them. That concludes our presentation. I'm going to go ahead and get rid of the screen there and bring myself back up. I hope this has been helpful for you. I do have a free gift for you. It's a workbook that you can use with the process that I outlined here so that you can take notes and write down, This is the blog post.

[00:25:53.780] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Here's what I need to do on that blog post. Or you can also record your data in there so that if you want to go back and compare it, it'll be easy to do so. If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to email me at sherry@painlessbloganalytics. I'll be happy to help you with any questions that you have. I would love it if you go over to Facebook and follow my page, painlessblog analytics. Thanks again for watching.

[00:00:13.370] - Trevann
Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me today. I am Trevann and I'll be presenting SEO Copywriting for bloggers. But before I get started, I just want to to thank you for taking titles of your day to hang out with me. I really hope that you find this presentation helpful and that you walk away learning something.

[00:00:42.070] - Trevann
So, I will be doing a quick introduction. As I said, my name is Trevann. I am an SEO copywriter. I help women entrepreneurs create blogs that are SEO friendly so that they can make sales, generate leads, attract organic traffic and stress less. I also help women business owners craft emails because as you know, emails are a great way to drive traffic to your blog.

[00:01:11.530] - Trevann
Just all the random facts about missing through you know hanging around.

[00:01:20.930] - Trevann
I studied molecular biology in College, which might seem random, but I actually write SEO friendly science articles for clients and the research fields that I've learned from you know studying molecular biology, I think are very helpful. I'm also Jamaican. So, if there are any other Jamaicans listening, just say, hey in the chat. So, you're probably wondering what makes you so qualified to tell me about SEO or SEO copywriting? That's a great question.

[00:02:02.270] - Trevann
I completed the SEO Expert Learning path on LinkedIn. I do SEO courses on HubSpot SEMrush. I'm always doing another course. I really like to learn new information and I always feel like there's something more to learn. I have been writing content for maybe five years, maybe five years.

[00:02:28.070] - Trevann
And I honestly think that the best part of the SEO, the creation of the content. And you probably know too, that there are so many different facets to SEO, right? You have local SEO, you have the technical aspects. But seeing as though I'm coming from like a content appraisal background, I really fell in love with like on page SEO. And so that's really what I focus on.

[00:03:01.250] - Trevann
I've also been blogging for myself on others four or five years now, and so you know let's get started.

[00:03:17.310] - Trevann
So, what we're going to cover today is what is SEO copywriting, elements of SEO copywriting, you know why should you not care about SEO copywriting, and ten steps to create blog posts using SEO copyrighted techniques. Right before we start, I just want to ask that you put your phone on do not disturb because we have so much to cover today and I don't want you to miss anything. So, what is SEO copywriting? You know that SEO stands for search engine optimization and copywriting is writing for conversions.

[00:04:03.190] - Trevann
So, what is SEO copywriting? So I define it as the process of writing and publishing content that appeals to both search engines and people.

[00:04:16.990] - Trevann
So, let's get into the elements of SEO copywriting. So that includes use of keywords, having a great headline, appropriate reading level for your audience, use of images, use of alternative text, well structured content, valuable content, and of course, having a call to action. So, you don't want your right into sown robotic because you're only thinking about ranking on google. Let me tell that Google actually prefers articles that are valuable and helpful and structured well. So, really, if you are creating SEO content, good SEO content is going to be good for readers as well.

[00:05:12.810] - Trevann
So, why should I care about the SEO copyrighting? And that's one of your questions. So, SEO copywriting techniques can help users generate more traffic to your blog posts through organic search, will help you rank higher in the search results, you generate leads, build your email list, make sales.

[00:05:36.690] - Trevann
SEO copywriting is a great way to have your content work for you.

[00:05:46.530] - Trevann
So, let's look at some ranking factors. Just so you know, they're not four ranking factors, they're actually over 200. But what I can say is that SEO copywriting helps with at least four of them. So, let's look at site speed. Briefly.

[00:06:03.280] - Trevann
Site speed really means how long your site takes to load. If your site takes too long to load, people are going to leave. And if people are losing your site, they're not reading your post, they're not going to convert, it's not good. Right. So, SEO copywriting techniques that would help with site speed really would just be including images that are small, because if the images are too large, then the site is going to take longer to load.

[00:06:37.350] - Trevann
And we talk about that later on. The site speed is a bit more on the technical side, but because I wasn't going to cover images today, I decided to include it. Then you have title tags. So, those would be like your H1 tag, right. Your H one tag should have your keyword.

[00:06:59.680] - Trevann
That helps to tell Google, hey, this is what I'm trying to talk about, this is the information I'm trying to devote. And then you have other tags like the H2 tags, the H3 tags which will get into that you want to optimize. Then we have quality backlinks, so backlinks are just basically links to your content from someone else's website. So, if you're creating valuable content structured, well, easy to read and spell with information, then people are going to want to link back to your site and then you'll get more traffic because people click on that link.

[00:07:43.860] - Trevann
And having quality backlinks is great for your blog. Then we have user experience. So, user experience really boils down to having easy to read content, having content that your reader actually wants to read.

[00:08:03.910] - Trevann
Having content that either solves a problem, you know gives information, anything like that would fall on the user experience. And with what we're about to cover your users, your readers will have a good experience.

[00:08:23.590] - Trevann
So, let's get into the ten steps to create blog posts using SEO copywriting techniques. So, before you start writing, you're going to want to do keyword research. So, this is the SEO part of the SEO copywriting. So, I do keyword research using a keyword research tool. There are several you have Google Keyword planner.

[00:08:51.050] - Trevann
You have Moz. I personally use SEMrush. So, what you'll do is use this tool to find out how many people are searching for the keyword. How easier, harder will be to rank for the keyword? What are the other related keywords people are searching for?

[00:09:13.090] - Trevann
You want to opt for long tail keywords? So, long tail keywords, they're more specific. Right. And they're typically easier to rank for. So, long tail keyword would be, well, let's look at what the short tail keyword is.

[00:09:30.020] - Trevann
So, a short tail keyword for a glass would be glasses that is not specific at all. Am I speaking about all the glasses that you wear on your face? Are we talking about more than one glass? Are we talking about the history of glasses? We want to buy glasses.

[00:09:49.390] - Trevann
It's so not specific and super hard to answer because there are glasses you want something and more specific. So, a long tail keyword could be blue line glasses. So that's specific. It's worth more specific. You should also pick keywords with low competition.

[00:10:12.430] - Trevann
So, the keyword research tool will tell you how easy or how hard it would be to rank for that specific keyword. If there's a low competition, then with really good structured content, then you have a higher chance of actually ranking, which is good. Then you need to look at search intent. So, SEMrush actually just released or just updated their tool, their keyword research tool where they actually attempt to give you the search intent of a specific keyword that you're searching for yourself..

[00:10:56.720] - Trevann
What's the search intent? It's really why somebody searches for this term. Do they want to make a purchase and they look at the information. What is the intent behind the search? As I mentioned, you can include related keywords and phrases.

[00:11:14.930] - Trevann
You don't have to use the same keyword all over the blog post. You can use related keywords. Google gets it or the other search engines.

[00:11:30.470] - Trevann
Now you want to structure your content. So, I don't know if you guys just dive right into writing. I prefer to do an outline. And so after I do my keyword research and I start to structure my content. So, I start to say, okay, this is what I'm going to have as my H1 tag. This is what I'm going to have H2, H3.

[00:11:52.880] - Trevann
Have points for my introduction, some points for my conclusion, what's my call to action.

[00:12:04.250] - Trevann
So that's how you create your outline. But in general, even if you just dive right in, you make sure that you have your intro, conclusion and the call to action. Use H2 and H3 tags. People might be confused about what the tag is their headings.

[00:12:25.070] - Trevann
They're just headings. So, make sure you have short paragraphs. People do not like large blocks of text. So, break up paragraph. Make sure that your sentences are concise, take out unnecessary words, use bullet points and use images.

[00:12:44.330] - Trevann
This is great for user experience, because if people click on your blog post and just say a wall of text, chances are they're not going to read it, even though you may have valuable information that would help them solve their problems. Just the look of it is all put in and so, structure in your content really well. We'll have people staying and reading and converting.

[00:13:12.990] - Trevann
So, next you'd like to hook your reader. So, now we're starting to really write. The first thing I really do is flesh out my introduction. So, when you're trying to hook your reader, you have to you know grab your attention. You can use a fact, a stat.

[00:13:35.370] - Trevann
You keep people reading. You use short sentences. You can you know write things like, here's the deal. This is what happens next.

[00:13:48.450] - Trevann
You string people along, that's how you write so that they want to continue reading and continue strolling their hope. You can also use the APP method, which stands for agree, promise and prep. And we're going to look at this briefly. So, for agree.

[00:14:11.190] - Trevann
Agree with you. An example if you stare at a screen all day and even if you don't realize your eyes will remind you that I definitely need a break and you know it. So, when I was writing down the long tail keyword example and I had blue light glasses in my head, so this is what this is relating to. But just say something that your reader would agree with. Like, I would probably say something like SEO looks daunting or SEO seems too hard.

[00:14:49.690] - Trevann
You know things like that. Next we're going to look at promise. Promise you relax some type of benefits. But protecting your eyes from all that blue light can provide so many surprises.

[00:15:05.230] - Trevann
It's like, I want to know. You know promise them something. What are they going to get when they're finished reading the spot? How will this help them? You know you can allude to that. Then you have preview.

[00:15:18.790] - Trevann
Give them a little synopsis of what the blog post's about. So, for example, we're going to look at five benefits of blue light glasses that change your life.

[00:15:31.630] - Trevann
You know you just give them an idea of what they're supposed to anticipate.

[00:15:43.670] - Trevann
I don't know if you guys usually include a little table of content in your blog post, but I think they're great. When I click on a blog post and I see the table content, I'm less likely to leave. I'm going to search the table content, find what I want, probably read the rest of it. I just like how it looks. I screenshot this from smart blogger. But as you know, it outlines what the post will be about.

[00:16:12.890] - Trevann
It's great for user experience. So, the next thing is to actually use your keywords. So, we're writing now with hook the audience. You need to use your keywords. You use the keywords in the body of the blog post, in the headings, in your title tag.

[00:16:34.610] - Trevann
In your meta description. There is the base on keyword stuffing. So, keyword stuffing basically means that you're using the keyword a lot like you just, a lot, in the blog post. So, I've heard people say keyword stuff is amazing. Google doesn't really care about it. And I'm like it's a big no no, do not keyword stuff. My take is if you don't want your content to just sound weird by just putting the keyword randomly, like when you read it, does it sound natural, so normal then it's fine.

[00:17:14.280] - Trevann
Use your keywords where necessary and include related keywords. You don't have to use the keyword as is, you can finally see keywords, your keyword planner tool, usually such as Zone. You can use those so that your writing doesn't sound robotic or not pleasant to read.

[00:17:42.970] - Trevann
So, I have an example here of a blog post using their keywords really well. So, this is headspace. As you can see, they have meditation for sleep.

[00:17:58.030] - Trevann
That is their keyword that they're trying to rank for. They included it in the headline or in the title tag. Even though the headline isn't compelling, it did the job in this case because they are ranking on the first page of Google for Meditation for sleep. So, just on the side note, if that's where you're going to if you're writing something about meditation asleep and you're looking at a post that's already up for it, you're going to look at how you can improve it. So, their headline is a compelling. You can write a compelling headline and hopefully rank on the first page as well.

[00:18:47.470] - Trevann
But you also have to look at their contents and see what they missed.

[00:18:51.130] - Trevann
Those and things like that. But anyway, they also have their keyword in the country, which I highlighted their meditation for sleep.

[00:19:03.470] - Trevann
They use related keywords like sleep meditation, so they don't just say meditations for sleep, meditations for sleep, meditations for sleep. They also use sleep meditation and I checked. They do run on the first page of Google for sleep meditation.

[00:19:22.670] - Trevann
Then they use the keywords in the H2 tag and you'll notice that they've used it in their meta description. So, just showing you how to use the keywords where to put them, make sure it sounds natural and normal. And I think they did a good job of that. Next you want to include internal links.

[00:19:46.020] - Trevann
So, link to other blog posts in all your blog posts where you see appropriate. Don't just link for link for ranking sake. You're going to link to a blog post that's really going to help your reader. So, if you're writing about I guess, I guess, let's just say, blue light glasses again, and you mentioned something like, you mentioned something like this is what would happen if you don't have blue light glasses and then you name the thing that happened and maybe you have a blog post where the thing did happen to you and you wrote about it. You can make that blog post right there because it's appropriate.

[00:20:33.550] - Trevann
They'll have a better understanding of what you're saying in this blog post. So, make sure the anchor text is relevant. So, you're probably like, what is the anchor text? So the anchor text would be where you hyperlink.

[00:20:50.370] - Trevann
So, instead of linking click here, you can use the title of the blog post that you're linking to or something else, but try to avoid things like click here.

[00:21:12.050] - Trevann
Using internal links helps the search engine to create an accurate site map, so they know the kind of content that you post, what your site's about, and you're going to get traffic to your blog post. So that's always great. You want to also include external links. So, you should link to other authoritative, credible sources in your blog post. Like, for example, in the science articles that I write, I link to other scientific studies.

[00:21:43.670] - Trevann
I link to sites like Health Line because they're credible and authoritative. And I think that really gives you some, it makes you look more credible as well and shows that you did your research and you are giving additional information to your readers. That might seem counterproductive to send your readers elsewhere, but it's actually a good thing to do to include external links.

[00:22:13.950] - Trevann
So, now we want to create a compelling headline. Your headline should captivate your reader and make them want to click on it. It should promise a benefit. Be specific. You can use headlines, ask a question, listicles.

[00:22:30.410] - Trevann
No, I love me a listicle. I write a lot of listicles because I think they're great and the readers do think they're great too. And you should use words like secrets, tips, tricks, guides you know people love that. So you might have a great article.

[00:22:51.300] - Trevann
But if your ideal reader doesn't like the headline or it's not compelling enough, they're not going to click on it. And if they don't click on it, they won't share the article either. That will impact your traffic, sales, lead generation, everything. So, even though you might have followed all the other steps, it's really a good idea to create a compelling headline so that people will want to click on it, want to share it, want to listen to it, wants to read it. You know what I mean.

[00:23:29.890] - Trevann
So, I use Coschedule to help with my headlines sometimes, it's a website. It will tell you how your headlines are doing. Of course it's just a bot, but it can provide useful tips. Also, it's a good idea to keep a swipe file.

[00:23:51.910] - Trevann
So, if you've seen a really good headline that you're like, wow, this is great. I wish I came up with that. You can actually save it. In a file, you could link to the article. Just copy and paste the headline.

[00:24:05.600] - Trevann
And of course, you're not going to steal a headline, but you can keep it there and revisit it. But when you have it right those block, you really can't compare a headline that will help you.

[00:24:18.870] - Trevann
So, I looked at some headlines. I Googled writing better blogs and these were the top results. So, as you can see the first is, there's a listicle because people of numbers, especially odd numbers. Not really sure why, but I realized, like, three reasons, five tips, seven secrets, things, odd numbers.

[00:24:45.100] - Trevann
People like that. And notice that leaves the word tips. Also, the one under it promises a benefit. You'll be able to write it right there's. Not so great.

[00:24:56.520] - Trevann
Of course. So, you don't want to click on it. And that's part of the reasons why these blogs probably rank so high. And I'm sure they're great and you know they have substance, but their headlines are really good. So, these are two headlines of mine for two blogs that I have that rank on the first page of Google.

[00:25:20.590] - Trevann
So, these are from the blog that I have as a hobby. Notice that they're specific. They promise a benefit. They're simple. It tells you exactly what you're going to get.

[00:25:35.230] - Trevann
This is another headline that I've written for a post that ranks on the first page of Google. But this one is for our client. Note you see, I told you I've listicles.

[00:25:45.610] - Trevann
So, Seven Ways and numbers you know my spice sparks on curiosity. So, it works. So that's an example. Next, you need to write your call to action. What do you want your readers to do?

[00:26:02.630] - Trevann
Buy something, subscribe to your email list. Tell them you can use a button or have a link. I think it may be a good idea that when you're planning your blog post, you automatically know what your calls actually is going to be. Like why are you creating this blog post? Are you going to promote your own products?

[00:26:25.650] - Trevann
Affiliate marketing? Are you looking for engagement? Is that why you guys create your blog post? Drop it in the chat below. Why do you primarily create blog posts?

[00:26:38.930] - Trevann
So, I'm just showing some examples of call to action. So, the Headspace article from earlier. This is what they have, Try headspace of three days, the button and they're trying to generate leads. This one is from Clever Girls Finance, where they want people to access their free courses. Next, edit the method description.

[00:27:03.320] - Trevann
So, if you don't edit it, Google will put something in there. There is still a small chance that you will edit it, and Google will just put what they feel like. I noticed that it does that sometimes, I don't know why, but it's still good to just edit it anyway. So the meta description is what people are going to see in the search results page.

[00:27:23.460] - Trevann
Make it interesting so that people click on your blog instead of someone else's. So, include your keyword, remember, and your call to action. So, this is an example of the method description that I use for this blog here that ranks on the first page, telling them what expects. I included my keyword and I'm encouraging them to click the list.

[00:27:50.310] - Trevann
Use images. People love images. As a matter of fact, it says there's a stat out there that says bloggers who added ten or more images in a blog post. Of course, it's stronger results than those who didn't. So, make sure the image file is small so that it doesn't affect that speed negatively.

[00:28:10.790] - Trevann
Edit the alt text in the images. Add keywords real relevant. Don't put them where they don't belong. They're descriptive with their text and you don't have to use it.

[00:28:24.290] - Trevann
If the image is purely decorated.

[00:28:29.170] - Trevann
So, those are the ten. Let me just recap real quick. Do your keyword research, structure your content to be reader friendly who care readers. Use your keywords.

[00:28:44.530] - Trevann
Include internal links, include external links. Create a compelling headline. Write your calls to action, edit your method description. Get images. So, I have a freebie. I created this.

[00:29:02.870] - Trevann
It's the only business, login checklist that you need. It helps you to employ SEO copywriting techniques because as I said, you know that's a list of things that you have to remember. But there are more things that I included in the checklist, I separated it into before it start writing while you're writing and after you're writing to help you to get traffic, you know generate leads and make sales.

[00:29:41.150] - Trevann
So, thank you. Let me know if you guys have any questions whatsoever.
