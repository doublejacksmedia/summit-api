Thank you so much for being here. I'm excited to be part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit this year and today we're going to talk about actually, let me just here's my face. But this is not about my face. This is about you and helping you get more engagement reach and sales on social media. In fact, let me just share my screen there so we can focus on that. And today is going to be all about that. I'm going to share some strategies that nobody else seems to be talking about but that are relatively simple to implement in your business. But even though they're simple, they are powerful. And I think just about anyone will walk away from this with something that can make a massive impact. But I don't want to waste people's time. So, let's talk about who will benefit the most from what I'm going to talk about today.

[00:00:53.050] - Jerry
Okay, doe this sound like you like? You know, social media is important to your business, to your blog, but it leaves you feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. If so, this is going to be really helpful if you feel like you know what to do, but there's just not enough time to get it right or do it well. This will be helpful for you. And if you feel like your audience is engaged, but when it comes to buying, you only hear crickets, whether it's buying your products or maybe it's buying products you're an affiliate for or anything like that. So, if any of those sound like you, let me assure you you're in the right place and this should be helpful.

[00:01:30.760] - Jerry
So, I know that we all have to multitask, but a lot of the time with this type of training can be one tiny piece that makes a massive difference for you. And here's the thing about me. I ad lib quite a bit, and people have often said the biggest take away from one of these presentations was something I just said between slides. So, I am asking you that you close your other tabs, put your phone away, whatever it takes to focus. And of course, this will also make sure that the video stream comes through nice and clear. Also, as an efficiency geek, I never make presentations any longer than necessary. But to reward you for being here through the end, I want to send you this guide for free. Six Ways to Cut your Social Media workload in half and half is on the low end. By the way, some businesses that have gone through these have eliminated 80% of what they were doing and actually seen their results increase. And I'll share that so you can do the same before we wrap up today.

[00:02:20.140] - Jerry
So, now, if we don't know each other, and I'm assuming that for most of us we don't. My name is Jerry Potter. Yes, it rhymes with the boy wizard. And I founded Five Minute Social Media, which has helped over half a million different people worldwide. This year alone. I'm completely blown away and honored to have seen that happen. I've specialized in content creation and engagement strategies my entire career and the last ten years around social media. I created the Five Minute Social method, which is a system designed to cut the amount of time businesses spend on social media by up to 80% because you shouldn't have to spend that much time. You're trying to run a blog or a business. I also love speaking at conferences when those were still happening in person, but got to do a lot of virtual events over the last year as well and have spoken in person both here in the United States where I'm located, as well as abroad. I live in Seattle with my family, including my two Chinese superheroes. And the only thing you need to know about us as a family is we are that family that will go out in costume sometimes when the need arises.

[00:03:20.170] - Jerry
So, I want to tell you how I got here, because where I used to be might be exactly where you are now, overwhelmed and frustrated by social media. I was working for a company in 2014 that wanted us to post on Facebook 48 times per day. Now you can see that forty eight on the screen there. But when I talk about this on a Podcast, they'll usually say four to eight times per day, like four to eight. That's a lot. And I said, "No, no, no 48 times per day works out to 17000 something posts per year." Literally just throwing up everything that we can think of and hoping something would stick. And about a year later I started thinking there's got to be a better way to do things, you know, because one day somebody is telling you to post more. Next day they're telling us to post less. And I was still skeptical. I didn't have a team of copywriters or graphic designers or videographers. It was just me for the most part. No corporation size budget. Could I get results? And even if I found something that did work, what did you change again, the way social media always seem to do. So, the doubts were there, but I was determined. I just thought there's got to be a better way. Right. I started looking at all the things you can do on social media. Then I started correlating those with which tasks actually drove revenue, because ultimately that's why you have a business and maybe with your blog, it's not a business, maybe it's a movement. It's about getting information out there.

[00:04:44.080] - Jerry
Whatever that thing is that you're trying to do, the impact you're trying to have on the world, there are some things you can do on social media that help and others that don't. So, I doubled down on those tasks that were leading to revenue and the revenue started going up.

[00:05:00.100] - Jerry
Hey, surprise. The results started increasing. And then I stopped focusing on the tasks that make little to no difference. And all that happened was I got my time back and that's what leads me to today, I'm so excited to share the Five Minute Social method, which is what I'm going to share the framework of here to help you increase your engagement reach and sales.

[00:05:21.120] - Jerry
So, this was created I used to work at an agency and then I perfected it, working with hundreds of small business owners over the last few years. So, this is what I teach in depth in my signature course. But I'm going to show you the key principles so that you can start to see a difference literally today or tomorrow if you put some of these into play. And I'm going to do it by sharing solutions to four of the most common social media problems that I hear from here about from people.

[00:05:46.830] - Jerry
Number one, I have no reach and/or engagement because if nobody's seen your posts, they're not engaging or both and your social media is kind of dead in the water. Right. You're posting and nothing's happening. It's like being an unpaid social media intern in your own business.

[00:06:04.260] - Jerry
Number two, people find me on social media. I got lots of people, but they don't buy. Sometimes your visibility is good, but even when people recommend you, even nobody buys. OK, we're going to solve that problem today.

[00:06:17.670] - Jerry
Number three, my audience is engaged, but they don't buy. Sometimes you've got a good sized audience. They're engaging all the time, but they don't buy or hire you. So, let's tackle that.

[00:06:26.310] - Jerry
And number for business owners. Don't have time for good social media. I'll hear that a lot. Busy people don't have time for good social media. This is a common belief that I want to challenge. And by the time we're done, I'm going to show you how what we do with the five minute social method is to make sure that there is time.

[00:06:45.240] - Jerry
Okay, so let's start with the first one up first. I have no reach or engagement and we usually blame social media algorithms for this, right? The algorithm just won't show my posts to people. And a lot of times people will ask me, how do you beat the algorithm? How do you how do I hack the algorithm? And I wish that I could tell you that Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, sent me a text message once upon a time saying, "All you've got to do is post three point four, six times per week and we'll show all your posts to all your followers." Unfortunately, that's not true. But here's the thing. The algorithm can't be beat. It can't be hacked, but it can be romanced. And I say this because you have to work with the algorithm, charm and be friends with it, otherwise you shouldn't even bother posting. If you are not going to post in a way that the algorithm helps you, then don't bother. You will remain an unpaid social media intern in your business, as I did for a really long time.

[00:07:50.400] - Jerry
So, we're talking about engagement, reach and sales today. So let's talk about engagement versus reach. So, engagement is exactly what it sounds like. People engaging on your posts, liking, commenting, sharing, clicking the link through to your blog. All of that. And reach is the number of people who see your posts. So, when your post says 726 people reached or 13,420, that's how many people saw your post. Doesn't mean they read. It doesn't mean that they clicked on it or anything like that. It just means that it came into their feed at some point. But the important thing to know is that it's not engagement versus reach so much as it is engagement equals reach. They are directly tied to each other. So, when you put up a post on any social media network, the algorithm doesn't know how good it is, Instagram doesn't know that you took an amazing photo.

[00:08:44.820] - Jerry
LinkedIn doesn't know that the stuff you're saying is life changing. Facebook doesn't know that you spent 37 hours making the perfect graphic in Canva. All the algorithm knows is whether or not someone engages with it. So, when someone likes your post, the algorithm thinks, "Oh, okay, this might be okay content". When more people start liking it, commenting, sharing, the algorithm goes, "Oh, this is great content. I'm going to show this to more and more people. So, that takes us back here. Engagement equals reach. The more engagement you get, the more people your posts will reach. So, to romance, the algorithm. You've got to get engagement.

[00:09:26.220] - Jerry
So inside of my course, I show you a bunch of ways to get more engagement. And we're a little tight on time today for this. But let me get you started with a few of my favorite easy ways to increase your engagement today. People have started applying these and immediately seen results, which I love.

[00:09:43.380] - Jerry
And the first one is going to be super, super obvious. But a lot of times when somebody says, "Yeah, I just can't get the engagement", and I'll do an audit of their Instagram account or their Facebook business page or whatever it might be, I notice that they are not asking for engagement. Sometimes that's all it takes. You have to ask. Remember somebody's scrolling a social media feed is busy. It's kind of an oxymoron, right? Well, if they were busy, they wouldn't have time to scroll social media feed, but they're just scrolling through. Sometimes they're in line at the store. Sometimes they just have an extra 60 seconds. Other times they're trying to distract themselves. You have to ask. They're not nobody opens Facebook and goes, "All right, who can I engage with right now?" That's not the approach. So ask simple as that.

[00:10:35.820] - Jerry
Number two is to take a stance. This is one of my favorites and I love it because it makes a massive difference. And I'll share an example here in just a second. But taking a stance means that you are more likely to get engagement because you're going to elicit a response in somebody else. Now, when we feel an emotion, we are more likely to comment on a post if a post makes us feel something and sometimes all it takes is taking a stance, I'm going to use a silly example. But if you posted do you like pineapple on pizza? You might get a few people that would say, "Oh, yeah, I like pineapple" or "No, no, I don't like pineapple," that can be very polarizing for people. But if you said, "Pineapple is the worst pizza topping of all time, fight me on this." Well, they either think, "Yes, it is. It's so awful." And they'll comment that or they think, "No, it's not. I love pineapple on pizza." What's wrong with you? But you took a stance and it doesn't have to be frivolous like that. It could be about your product or your industry or any number of things. But when you take a stance on things, people will have an emotional reaction because they will either agree or disagree with you. All right. And as a blogger, you're probably taking a lot of opinions and stances, I would think, for most of you anyway.

[00:12:02.140] - Jerry
And then the third one comment on your own post. I love this one because it has. Exponentially increasing effects when it comes to engagement. I'll show you what I mean. So on this post, I said, "For your business, did you design your own logo or hire someone else? My awkward answer below, and this was just an organic post that got 117 comments. And when I asked this, I really didn't know that it was going to take off like this, but it did.

[00:12:31.890] - Jerry
But here's here's the principle here. You notice I said my awkward answer below. So when you post this, I said, "For your business, did you design your logo or hire someone else?" If somebody comes along and they don't have an answer right away, but they're like, "Oh, I wonder what his answer is. Oh, and it's awkward." They're going to click on that thing that says one 117 comments. Then they SEO when they do that, that counts as engagement because they clicked on it, "Oh okay, engagement." Then if they read my answer and they click like on it, that counts as engagement. If they then reply to my answer, that is also engagement. And if they're moved to then leave their own answer, because I've given an example that's more engagement. And if a bunch of people start commenting and then people start going through, even if they aren't going to post themselves and they start liking other people's comments and replying to them, that's all engagement as well. So, it really can snowball. But the best part about this is just like nobody likes to be the first one to a party, generally, nobody likes to be the first one to comment on a post. So, by you commenting yourself, you have already gotten that out of the way.

[00:13:40.570] - Jerry
Here's a funny taking a stance post, and if you can't read it because of the screen you're on, it says, "When is this country going to wake up and admit that watermelon is the worst melon and doesn't even come close to having as good a texture or flavor as honeydew or cantaloupe?" Now, I'm not going to use an example that's political or anything super polarizing like that, but here's a silly topic. But he got a lot of engagement on this post because he took a strong stance. If he just said, "I don't care for watermelon", people have been like, "Yeah, okay".

[00:14:11.630] - Jerry
So, which one of these will you try first side, really quick, you're going to ask for engagement, super basic, take a stance or comment on your own post and yes, those can be combined.

[00:14:22.190] - Jerry
All right. Now we know how to reach people, like getting them engaged. Let's dive into common problem number two; people find me on social media, but they don't buy. In other words, we're trying we're struggling to turn our followers into buyers now in most cases, or I should say in a lot of cases, people want to buy from you or hire you or whatever the case might be, but they just don't know how. If you use Facebook, you have probably seen this the last few years. The  looking for recommendations feature. So, imagine someone asks their friends for a reference, looking for a home contractor, a life coach, photographer, fitness trainer, and someone recommends you they even tag your business in the comment. So now I've asked for a referral. My friend, who I trust recommends you. I go to your page. You got great reviews. I am ready to give you, like, take my money. But the problem is, I don't know how to hire you. I don't know how to I don't know what to do next. And I didn't put a slide here because I didn't want to accidentally call out someone that might be watching this.

[00:15:21.680] - Jerry
But I land on your page. There's no obvious next step to take with you. And it's not that as consumers, we're not smart, it's not that your people aren't smart, they're just busy. And I know on our end, you know, it's our page pager profile or whatever we're thinking like, well, duh, click on about scroll down, find my phone number and call me or send me a message or whatever. But again, we're busy. So what do we do? If I really like you, I'll tell myself I'll come back and figure it out later. I got to do some other stuff right now, but we almost never do because life just goes on. So, how do we avoid this? Make sure your pager profile has three things. All right. Turning followers into buyers.

[00:15:59.670] - Jerry
Number one, what you do now, in some instances, you can just choose a category like I think blogger is a category for a Facebook business page, and that could just be it. It says blogger. But you can't just say blogger.

[00:16:14.730] - Jerry
They need to know what kind of blogger you are. So make sure it's clear what you do. It may be obvious to you. It will not be to others. Maybe you can have a Facebook group where you don't know people very well and send them a ask a couple people to help you and send links, say, hey, can you figure out exactly what I do? Or look at my page for five seconds and tell me what I do?

[00:16:35.130] - Jerry
Next, why are you different? We each get bombarded with ten thousand brand messages a day, there are obviously millions of Facebook business pages and Instagram profiles and LinkedIn profiles and all of these things. You've got to stand out. Why are you different?

[00:16:50.700] - Jerry
And then the last thing that we were just kind of alluding to, what should they do next? That's it. What do you want me to do next? So, this is a Facebook business page, but you can see on the cover photo what I do. I coach business owners on how to attract more paying clients using the world's simplest social media strategies. Why I'm different. Focusing on simplicity. What I want you to do next, join my group. That's what the blue button says, because I know once people are in my group, I can nurture them into becoming part of my programs.

[00:17:18.670] - Jerry
Tom, who's a guy who is in my- took my course and is now in the face- my- sorry group coaching program, he optimized his business pages and the things I just showed you and a couple more things that we teach in the course. And he had a woman call his business to hire him. And he said, "Oh, how did you hear about him?" And she said, "Oh, I found you on Facebook." And at the time he only had one like on his Facebook business page. But she got there. She saw what he did. She saw why he was different and she knew what to do next. And the coolest thing is Tom has a local services business. He does dryer vent cleaning. He went out and then she told all her neighbors. And so this one thing led to a bunch more business. I think he said eventually in that neighborhood he did three thousand dollars worth of business or something like that.

[00:18:04.540] - Jerry
All right. Let's tackle common problem number three. My audience is engaged, but they don't buy. So, maybe this is something you struggle with. Like you've got people, they're engaged, they're commenting. And then you say, "Hey, it's time to buy or this is open", or whatever it might be, and nobody takes the time to buy anything. And I want to share a lie that I used to tell myself all the time, and you probably heard people say this, maybe even said it yourself, social media is only good for top of mind awareness.  This what I used to tell myself for my social media wasn't working. My post for reaching people, sometimes lots of people, but it wasn't driving any revenue. And rather than figure out how to fix the problem, we tell ourselves things like, well, "It's good for top of mind awareness" or "Oh, my social media is just to increase exposure." "It's a branding exercise." And certainly social media can do those things.

[00:18:56.650] - Jerry
I used to tell myself it just can't be used to get people to actually buy or hire me or anything like that, especially, you know, maybe if I had a big budget or a big team. I don't know about you, but I don't have those things laying around.

[00:19:08.840] - Jerry
So, this is the typical social media plan: Somebody starts a business or they have their veteran business and they're like going to get on social media, going to set up all my networks, start posting and then wait for money. Why isn't it coming? I post every day. What's happening? What's missing from that plan is nobody set any social media goals. You might have goals, but if you're not making regular, trackable revenue from them, they might be the wrong goals. You got to set specific social media goals. Okay.

[00:19:33.980] - Jerry
So, let's talk about what social media goals are. They're different from your business goals? They may be different from your marketing goals. Your marketing goals might be to increase market share 10% or something like that. The goals are specific to social media. They are the catalyst, the spark that makes somebody become a paying customer or client or buy through your link or whatever it might be. Okay.

[00:20:00.710] - Jerry
Let's talk real quick about what social media goals aren't. Posting every day. Not a social media goal. Okay, that's a to do list. Getting more followers, not a social media goal because followers don't mean you'll get any sales. This woman had two million followers on Instagram, couldn't make any money from it. So, when you set a social media goal, it needs to lead to revenue. And when you figure this out, the results can be amazing.

[00:20:22.730] - Jerry
So, if you're a blogger, maybe you know that when somebody like for every hundred views you get on your blog, you make money, you make three hundred dollars on average or something like that. In that case, then your social media goal might be to drive blog traffic. But if that's not helping you, you know, you are trying to get money from it, not just get somebody to read what you're writing, then you may need to pivot.

[00:20:46.280] - Jerry
Michelle Taylor, who is in my group coaching program, she recently named one of her social media goals, and that was to get people on to webinars. And she had one post that led to fifteen hundred dollars a month in new revenue. Now, she's pretty humble, but I always joke with her that if those new clients stay for a full year and this is maybe four months ago now, they stay for a full year and hers pretty much will do that one post will be worth eighteen thousand dollars. This is what can happen when you like. Dial this in. It's amazing. One post. And by the way, no ad spend. This was one organic post.

[00:21:20.030] - Jerry
So, social media goals, what can they be? Well, start by figuring out what happens right before someone buys from you. That's that catalyst that I was talking about. Okay. And then for some businesses, think about what would cause people to buy from you without social media, then use social media to reach that goal. So, in my business, people often hire me after we have a conversation about their business. So, there's no social media that would involve going to networking events, meeting people. The social media equivalent of that is to get people into one on one conversations. So, that's one of my social media goals.

[00:21:54.200] - Jerry
Another one is to get people to join my email list, because I know that a certain percentage of those will go on to invest in a course or coaching. Now, if this is tough to figure out right at this second, you're not alone. I work on this a lot with people in my programs. But just think about what happens right before someone buys from you or hires you or does whatever that action is that you want them to take; something triggered them. So, what is that for you in this tiny mindset shift? Because once you figure this out, then you focus on those things and not just posting and hoping. This tiny mindset shift I've seen businesses change from, you know, struggling to making money in seven days. Once you figure this out, no more posting and hoping.

[00:22:43.820] - Jerry
And that does lead us to common problem number four, because these are related. "I'm too busy to have good social media. "Business owners are too busy to have good social media. I've said this. You may have said it or at least felt it. I probably hear it at least twice every single day with all the business owners I talked to online, which means I've heard it about seven hundred times in the last year. So, let's talk about it. There are two reasons we tell ourselves this. Number one, there are too many ways to market ourselves for free in the digital world. So, we do none of them well. Okay, number two, because we aren't making any money from social media. So, the first one, we're so distracted by the ninety nine thousand ways we can market ourselves, we don't do any of them well.

[00:23:29.560] - Jerry
And I'm just as guilty as you have constantly of new ideas. I want to try in my business. It didn't used to be this way back in the day. Any marketing you did required spending money. It could be on buying ads or getting scrappy and doing it yourself. But it still required printing letters, cards, flyers, posters, buying stamps. The point is, marketing used to cost money pretty much no matter what. So, there was no sorry. So, there was way more focus on getting things right. If you were going to spend even a few hundred dollars printing posters or sending out postcards, you put in the work to make it as good as it can be. But now, because we have all these social media channels and email and all these other things that we can sort of reach people free, we all we try everything. We sort of put 40% effort in it and we wait for something to work. And then that second one, we were too busy because we aren't making any money from social media. Who has time to work on things in their business that don't generate revenue? That's kind of the whole point, right?

[00:24:24.880] - Jerry
So, if you spend an hour a week, five hours a week, 10 hours a week on social media or some sort of obligation, maybe because everyone else is doing it, because someone you trust told you to that you had to. By the way, I'll never tell you that I'm not here to convince you. You have to market on social media. I work with people that already see the amazing potential of it and want to maximize it. But if you're spending time on social media and see no financial return, you'll always feel like you're too busy for it. But if you figured out a way, then for every hour you spend on social media, you made two hundred dollars in your business or five hundred dollars in your business, I bet you'd find the time, right? Oh, look at that. I am not busy anymore and I'm just throwing out numbers.

[00:25:04.630] - Jerry
A couple of minutes ago I told you about Michelle Taylor in the eighteen thousand dollar post. The point is, when you have regular, trackable revenue from your social media, you have no problem making time for it.

[00:25:15.850] - Jerry
So, let me see if I can help you envision how that would work in your business. So, we asked you to set these specific social media goals that would directly lead to revenue. The next step is to use those goals to eliminate all the things you do on social media that don't make money. Or if you are a blogger, that you're not in it for the money, whatever it might be, whatever your goal is. So, I want you to take your goal or one of them and reverse engineer it into a plan. That's right. We're going to build the plan backward.

[00:25:49.000] - Jerry
So, we talked about the typical plan. We set up your social media network, start posting, wait for money. One of the problems is that plan is built forward. Guess what happens when you build your plan backward? Then you can eliminate all the tasks that don't help you reach your goals. So, here's one example that might apply to you. So, we start off with the end goal, which, for this example, is revenue. It's money. It's the green dollar signs. Right. So, how do I- what's the catalyst that gets somebody to buy from me or buy a product I recommend or whatever it is? Well, usually I know that if a qualified buyer joins my email list, I make money in it. Then maybe you even know the numbers. For every hundred that join my email list, five of them become buyers or twenty or whatever it is. Okay, so what happens before that? That's the game we're playing. What happens before that? Well, right before a qualified buyer joins my email list, they usually read a highly targeted blog. And in that blog I have a download or just something that comes up in an online form they can fill out in the middle of the blog, whatever it is, say you read a highly targeted blog. Okay, well, how do I get more people to read the highly targeted blog? I share the blog and a niche specific Facebook group. So this is just one example of me working backwards from revenue. OK, what happens before that? What happens before that? What happens before that?

[00:27:10.920] - Jerry
And then we flip it around. Now we have our plan. I'm going to share this blog post, a niche Facebook groups for moms, for entrepreneurs, for puzzle fans. Whatever it is, you know, whatever your blog is, people will hopefully click through, read that highly targeted blog because they're the perfect person to read it. They will join my email list and then many of them will become buyers. That's just one example, but you take your goals, you reverse engineer them and then any other tasks that aren't leading to something that helps you reach your goals, in most cases, revenue ditch them and business owners end up cutting their workload by 50 to 80 percent by doing this.

So, again, the four common problems, I have no reach and/or engagements, people find me on social media, but they don't buy. My audience is engaged but doesn't buy. Business owners don't have time for good social media. And the solutions that I shared today to help you increase your engagement, reach and sales. First, you have to increase your engagement if you're going to increase your reach, so you've got to ask for engagement, make people feel something, take a stance, all of those. Second, optimize your pages and profile. So when people do discover you, they know what you do, why you're different and what to do next. Third, set these proper social media goals. And fourth, reverse engineer your strategy to eliminate the unnecessary tasks.
