[00:00:12.840] - Amanda
Thank you so much for being with me here today at the Breakthrough Blogger Summit. I was thrilled to have been asked to speak again by Liz. So, Liz, thank you so much for having me again today. Now, if you've been abound for one of my past presentations at a different Breakthrough Blogger summit or event, I'm going to be speaking on something a little bit different today.

[00:00:29.230] - Amanda
So, I'm really, really excited that you're here, because today, we're going to be talking all about strategic content planning for 2023. So, today we are going to really make sure that you have a pathway forward to make sure that your content that you're putting out in 2023 is aligned with those business goals that you have for your blog. And I am so excited to dive in with that. But if we haven't met yet, I'm Amanda Warfield. I'm a simplicity focused content marketing strategist and the host of the Chasing Simple podcast.

[00:00:55.530] - Amanda
I am a crazy cat lady, and I also own another business that is a Disney specialized travel agency. So, this content marketing thing, I've been around the block for a while, and I'm doing it not only for myself, with both of my businesses, but with all of my clients as well. And this is the system that I use to help them and my businesses plan out their content marketing for the year. Now, a couple of health key things before we get started. First and foremost, if you are here with me live, I am in the chat box.

[00:01:22.180] - Amanda
Let's chat, let's connect. I'm going to have some questions for you throughout this, but I want to make sure that we're interacting and creating a dialogue because there's a lot to fit into a very small presentation. And I know you're going to have questions, so I'm here with you live. Any questions at all, leave them in that chat box. If you are watching this while the summit is still going on, but the live event isn't happening.

[00:01:41.280] - Amanda
So, it's after that first initial hour where this presentation has gone live. I am in the Facebook group, so please post any questions or comments you have in the Facebook group. Just make sure to tag me, so that it doesn't get lost. And third, if you've grabbed the all access pass and you're watching this way, in the future, please send me a DM, either on Instagram or on TikTok at Mrs. Amanda Warfield on both of those, or send me an email.

[00:02:02.010] - Amanda
I'm hello@amandawarfield.com. And then finally, if there's something that you really love about this presentation, something that really inspires you or that you want to make sure you share or save for later, please feel free to take a picture of it and share it on Instagram or wherever. Just make sure to tag me if you do. Again, I'm at Mrs. Amanda Warfield.

[00:02:20.890] - Amanda
And with that, let's go ahead and dive in. Like I said before, today, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I craft a strategic and intentional content marketing plan in order to help you put out content that's going to help you hit your business goals. But first, throughout this presentation, I'm going to have some question boxes like this. And this is just a great way for me to get to know you, but also to help us have a conversation around this topic. Because frankly, there's not enough time for me to do as much as a deep dive into this as I would like.

[00:02:53.530] - Amanda
And I know you're going to have questions and I don't want you to walk away feeling overwhelmed. So, when these come up, please make sure to answer them either in the chat box if you're here live, or head over to the Facebook Group and answer them there. Just be sure to tag me in those posts in the Facebook Group, so that I make sure I see it. Because a lot of times when there's a summit, there are so many posts happening in the Facebook Group that things can get lost. And I just want to make sure I see all of your different questions, comments, concerns, everything.

[00:03:21.490] - Amanda
So, make sure you tag me. But let's go ahead and practice. First question for you for this presentation is what is your favorite food? Like I said, pop it in the chat box or let me know over in the Facebook Group. Personally, my favorite food is potatoes.

[00:03:35.530] - Amanda
I love them in every single form, whether it's mashed or baked or french fries or chips or any form of potato. Love them so, so much. So, let me know what your favorite food is. And now that we've got the simple question, a fun question out of the way, we've broken the ice, I want to know when it comes to marketing, when you think of marketing, what is your first thought? What's the first thing you think when you think marketing?

[00:04:00.220] - Amanda
Let me know either in the live chat box or in the Facebook group. Now here's our roadmap for today. First and foremost, our overview. That's where we are now. We're kind of breaking the ice getting into this thing, trying to get us all on the same page. So that we can move forward and really get some great steps going, so that you can plan out your 2023 strategically.

[00:04:24.860] - Amanda
Next, we're going to move into goals. We're going to look at what your goals are for the year and we're going to do a little goal mapping. Third, we're going to set up your calendar, so that your business supports your life. Fourth, we're going to talk about monthly efforts, what they are, what they do, and how to plan for them. And then finally, we're going to look at how you can craft your strategic content plan for the year.

[00:04:51.260] - Amanda
But I want to make sure that we are all on the same page about how marketing fits into your life, because there's a ton of messaging out there about how different coaches or programs or systems are meant to help you create a business that supports your dream life, quote, unquote. But how many times have you intended to work on a big project or hold a launch or a major marketing campaign only to discover that there was something happening in your quote, unquote real life that was getting in the way. Whether it was a sick kid or a school vacation you forgot about or somebody's birthday. And you realize, oh man, there's a lot of party prep I need to do, it kind of takes over. And then you're stuck, honestly, feeling pulled into totally different directions and feeling like a bad business owner and a bad wife, mom, friend, insert whatever.

[00:05:42.640] - Amanda
You end up feeling stretched too thin in both directions. And this happens because we tend to create our business plans and our life plans separately. We tend to have one calendar for business and one calendar for our home life. And a lot of times, we don't integrate the two of them together. But when you walk away from this presentation today, you are going to have the tools to create a fully integrated work and life calendar for 2023, so that you can fit your marketing into your business, in your business, into your life.

[00:06:17.060] - Amanda
So, phase one, first thing we're going to do is we're going to check on your big goal for the year. So, right now, what is your big goal? For the sake of an example, we're going to use 50,000 blog views in 2023. Let's say this is your big goal for 2023. You want to have 50,000 blog views by the end of the year.

[00:06:36.940] - Amanda
So, then we're going to take that big goal, and we want to break it down by quarter. We want to say, this is how many views I'm aiming for in Q one. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q two. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q three, Q four, so on, and so forth. Let's say, this is the numbers you leaned on.

[00:06:53.640] - Amanda
In Q one, you're going to have 9 thousand, Q two, 16 thousand, Q three, 15 thousand, Q four, 10 thousand, leading to a total of 50,000. And when you look at this, you want to consider a couple of things. One, you want to consider last year's numbers. Where are the rises and the falls? Things are not going to be consistent numberwise all year long.

[00:07:15.640] - Amanda
So, maybe you have an off season. Maybe you are someone who finds that you know their niche gets really, really popular in Q two and Q three, but it's not as popular in Q four and Q one of each year. And so, you know that you're going to want to make sure that Q one and Q four are spent kind of preparing for that influx in Q three and Q two without neglecting your business obviously, but you're preparing, so that, okay. Q one, Q four, they're going to be kind of steady.

[00:07:50.610] - Amanda
But Q two and Q three, that's where I'm going to hopefully see a jump, and then I know what's going to receive. So, you're going to want to think about that. You're also going to want to think about what's happening in your life. If you know that in Q two, you are just going to be wiped, that there's going to be a lot of family stuff going on, that you're traveling a lot, whatever may be going on, if you know that that's going to be happening in Q two, maybe your number for Q two isn't that high, maybe it's a pretty low number.

[00:08:14.520] - Amanda
Maybe you're in maintenance mode for Q two instead of push mode. Those are a couple things I want you to think of as you break down your goal. You kind of analyze what you think it's going to look like when. So, look at last year. Look at where your rises and falls are, and then also look at your life.

[00:08:33.070] - Amanda
We're going to go deep into your calendar here soon, but, you know, just kind of start thinking about that. These numbers are not end all, be all. But I want to know what is your big goal for your blog in 2023? Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the live chat.

[00:08:50.290] - Amanda
Let me know in the Facebook group whenever you're watching this. Let's talk about your big goal and how you can break that down. So, now we're going to move into goal mapping. And basically, what that looks like is you're going to take the next quarter. So Q one, okay, you decided Q one was going to be 9000 blog views, and we're going to get two things.

[00:09:11.970] - Amanda
One, what is your current monthly average? And two, what does that mean you need to bring in? So, if your current monthly average is 6000 views, you need to bring in 3000 more views throughout Q one. Well, how do we do that? That's always the next question.

[00:09:30.100] - Amanda
Okay, I know how much I need to bring in. How do I bring it in? And you're just going to brain dump. You're going to make a list of anything you can think of that can help you increase those blog views. Maybe it's something you've tried in the past and it's you've seen it work.

[00:09:44.100] - Amanda
Maybe it's something new you want to try in the new year. This is nothing concrete. This is just the simple brain dump mapping, projecting step. You're not worried about, this is a concrete action plan yet. This is just, here are some ideas that you have. So, some examples might be an improved Pinterest strategy.

[00:10:03.940] - Amanda
Maybe you're already on Pinterest, but you want to get even better with it, whether that's something you're going to take a course and learn it yourself or you're going to DIY it or you're going to hand it off to a Pinterest expert that can help bring in more people. Maybe that's guest blogging, maybe that's podcast interviews. What can you do to bring in those 3000 extra blog views for Q one? And because we're moving through this quickly, I don't have time to pause this and let you really think about it. So, just tell me, what is one action step that you can take to help reach your Q one goal?

[00:10:37.420] - Amanda
Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the Facebook group. So, now that we kind of know what our goals are and we know where we're heading and what we're working towards, let's map out your calendar. So, step one is to highlight, mark off all of the personal side of things because we want to create a calendar that will ensure your business is going to support your life. And in order to do that, we have to start with the personal side of things.

[00:11:06.430] - Amanda
So, any holidays that are coming up, any birthdays, any anniversaries, vacations, time off, anything on the personal side of things that goes in first. So, some examples. The second, maybe your family isn't going to be back in school yet, maybe your spouse isn't going to be back at work. So, the second, you're not working, your kids are going to have an okay day off.

[00:11:29.760] - Amanda
So that's not going to be a work day. You have a family birthday at the end of the month, and you want to make sure you take that day off. We are protecting time for these important things. Winter break, got to mark that off. President's Day, school holiday, got to mark that off.

[00:11:45.880] - Amanda
Maybe you have spring break, maybe you have a vacation you're taking, whatever is happening in your personal life, that goes in first. And unless you have those in, you're going to move into your work overview. So, what are some work things that you know are happening throughout this next quarter or really throughout the whole year? Batch weeks. If you do a batch week, pop that in there.

[00:12:09.450] - Amanda
If you have coordinating, planning or goal setting, pop that in there. If there's a retreat or a conference you're going to, pop that in there. Any type of time where you're stepping back from the day-to-day in your business, CEO days, whatever that looks like, you're going to put those in now. And then once you have all of your time off and your time back, you're going to look at promotions, and that's how you're going to know how you can fit promotions into your life and business without it taking over your life and business. So, things like Black Friday or filling 2023 client spots or affiliate promotions, anything that's recurring, you can pop those in.

[00:12:47.940] - Amanda
If you know there's going to be a price increase, you can pop that in. If you know, okay, well, I want to have a flash sale at this time, pop that in. Any kind of promotion that you know is going to happen, look at the calendar, see if there's really enough space, and if there is, put it in there. Monthly efforts is what we're going to get to in just a second.

[00:13:07.890] - Amanda
But when it comes to putting promotions in, you want to make sure you're giving yourself the time and the space to do them. So, you wouldn't want to put a promotion in probably at the beginning of January. January is really, really crowded. You want to make sure you have enough time to get prepped for that promotion. So, looking at January, there's really only if you're working on Monday through Friday schedule, which I know a lot of us don't, but if you are, you got, you don't even have a full week.

[00:13:34.110] - Amanda
Every single week during January, there's at least one day where you're not working or taking a step back. So, you may not want to do any kind of anything until later in the month. February, not as crowded, could definitely be a time where you could put something in. You want to look at what your specific calendar looks like and what your personal and work overview looks like, so that you know what you have the time and space for.

[00:14:00.510] - Amanda
Now, monthly efforts, let's talk about those. We're going to pause phase three, go into phase four, and then come back to phase three.

[00:14:09.410] - Amanda
There are six different types of monthly efforts that I want you to consider. A monthly effort is a task, a project, a bonus, they are all kinds of different monthly efforts, but it's a way to move the needle in your business in some way, shape, or form. Now, the first one, community builder. It is a low pressure, low key way to build relationships with your audience outside of your content.

[00:14:38.140] - Amanda
A visibility booster is getting in front of new audiences or doing a large event. Typically, these come right before a launch. A list builder, it really varies. It can be as high key as a 30 day challenge, or it could be as simple as promoting something that you already have, a freebie, or a product, or whatever. A list builder probably wouldn't be a product, but something free that you have that you're just trying to get people on your list.

[00:15:05.550] - Amanda
List building. PR is pitching yourself to write articles, be a guest on a podcast, etc. Promotion is, you know, what are you promoting this month? What's your focus? Is it you know a larger launch that's coming up that you're focusing on? Is it a smaller flash sale?

[00:15:25.080] - Amanda
Is it, you don't really have anything major happening, but you just want to make sure that you're sharing about this one particular product in your shop, whatever that looks like, what are you promoting in order to make money, and then additional content. So, for example, if you have a membership, if you're going to be creating any additional content, you want to make sure to make a note of it so that you don't forget about it. So, typically, like I said, this is used when you have a membership or if you're just creating bonus content for some reason. Now, when it comes to monthly efforts, these are ways to help you get seen, marketing and content marketing in and of itself is great.

[00:15:59.170] - Amanda
But if content marketing is the only marketing you're doing and you're not building relationships and you're not doing any kind of monthly efforts, you're not going to grow. Content marketing is great for building relationships with people that have already found you. But if you want to get found, these are some monthly efforts you want to make sure that you're incorporating into your plan. Promotion isn't really going to help you get, I mean, it could just by nature if you're really going out for launch, but promotion is more. 

[00:16:25.120] - Amanda
So, you just want to make sure that you don't forget that you should be promoting something because of your business. But when it comes to monthly efforts, one, I want you to remember to start with one or two, start small. Do not feel pressured to do any of these just because they're an option. And two, as you start doing these, think about what can I automate and what can I pass off?

[00:16:47.230] - Amanda
And then let's say you decide, okay, first, I'm going to do a list builder and I'm going to create a new freebie and share about it. Well, next month you may be able to automate that. You may be able to just talk about it in your content and not have to worry about building it, building the actual freebie, building the actual system behind it because you're going to work on automating it as you create it.

[00:17:09.700] - Amanda
But those are all things to think about, how can I automate this? How can I pass it off, so that I can continue to list build without it really taking up a ton of my time and effort. Now this is something you're going to want to screenshot. This is how I kind of look at my monthly efforts and make sure I'm not planning too much. Just take a screenshot of this, so that you can have that kind of in mind.

[00:17:29.800] - Amanda
But I tend to, I always kind of have an idea of one thing I'm promoting each month, which is going to be strategic based on the content that's going out. And then maybe one other, maybe, if it's a really busy month, maybe nothing else. If you're doing any kind of collaborations, make sure you're putting them on here. But fill this out. You don't want to fill it out totally.

[00:17:51.480] - Amanda
You want it to be very sparse, but having it in front of you of this is where I'm going each month and this is what my focus is, will help you keep things cohesive and also help you keep them simple. So, I want you to take a second and think, are you actually already implementing any of these monthly efforts? Maybe you're already pushing yourself to be a guest blogger. Maybe you already have a freebie, maybe you already have a way to build community with your audience. Are you already implementing any of these?

[00:18:27.550] - Amanda
Let me know in the chat. But that's something to really think about, because if you're already implementing, just keep doing what you're doing. And again, look at what you're already implementing and say, can I automate it? Can I pass it off? And if yes, great.

[00:18:41.520] - Amanda
Then maybe you can add something new in next month or next quarter. Now, like I said, we're going to go back to phase three with the calendar, now that we know about monthly efforts, and we kind of have an idea of what that looks like. So, for the end of phase three, we are going to put those monthly efforts in. Let's say for January, you decide your monthly effort is going to be pitching for guest blogging opportunities. And you're just going to put a little sticking up on the top of January, because that's a goal that you're going to have. It's not a set date except other than the end of January, but your goal is that you're going to pitch to ten guest blogging opportunities throughout January.

[00:19:16.960] - Amanda
Let's say in February, you decide that you want to do some bonus content. You're going to do some live workshops, and you've got that, those are the dates for the end of February. And then you decide that you want to do a huge visibility booster because you're going to do a flash sale, end of March, you're going to do that March, and you're going to do a five-day challenge. By mapping all of this out, you're able to see just what you're putting on your plate.

[00:19:42.660] - Amanda
You're able to see how full your month is. So, for February, you know, that, okay, I have a couple weeks in February, after I get my prices increased, I know that I'm going to be working on these live workshops. And maybe you're already working on those in January too, as you're doing the guest blogging opportunities. And then, you know, okay, after I do this live workshops, the next thing is going to be this five-day challenge will bring some people in.

[00:20:04.150] - Amanda
And that five-day challenge is going to lead to the flash sale. So, what's the flash sale of? Okay, that's how you determine what your five-day challenge is going to be. So, now we have everything mapped out on your calendar, we're going to go into creating your content plan and your strategy.

[00:20:20.020] - Amanda
So your content is going to be based purely on this calendar and those monthly efforts that you have already determined.

[00:20:29.440] - Amanda
So, step one, when it comes to creating monthly content, you're going to double-check your dates. You're going to add anything new. Maybe you learned about a new vacation or your child care has changed or there's going to be time away. Maybe you thought of new things for your business and you're going to pop them in. I really don't recommend that on a monthly basis, but you know, sometimes it happens and it is what it is.

[00:20:50.770] - Amanda
So, any of that, add any of that to your calendar if you need to. And then we're going to create that monthly plan. There is a difference between a plan and a strategy. A plan is simply mapping out where you're posting and when. So, when it comes to creating your monthly plan, you're going to put any important dates in. So, for January, you would say, okay, the second I'm off the 16th, I'm off the 27th, I'm off the 30th and 31st, prices are increasing.

[00:21:19.990] - Amanda
You're going to put all of those things in your monthly plan, so that you can remember that they're there. Then you're going to do your longform content, in this case, your blog. What blogs are going where, and you don't know the top. You don't need to know the topic yet, but just when are you posting a new blog? Put those in. When are you going to send an email newsletter?

[00:21:39.570] - Amanda
Put that in. When are you going to put up social media and where? Put that in. Instagram, post, Facebook post, Tiktok, whatever social media platform you're on, when are you posting? Go ahead and map all of that out, so that you can see when you need to start talking about certain topics.

[00:21:56.730] - Amanda
This is going to be really important when it comes to the strategy side of things because if you know prices are increasing on the 30th and the 31st, and that's when your prices are moving around. If you know that, then in the week leading up, you know to talk about that. So, this is going to help you be really strategic with what you're talking about and when. But now we've got to create the strategy. And strategy is using that plan and using all of the other things that we've created to decide what you're talking about and how.

[00:22:26.320] - Amanda
And you're going to finalize your long-form content with the big three. First, your call to action, then your topic, and then your hook. And you're going to decide these in that order. So, your call to action is going to be what leads your people to the next step. And the next step is going to want to be aligned with your current business goals.

[00:22:48.000] - Amanda
So, if you're trying to get your blog view as 50,000 blog views, your CTA is going to be how you can get more blog views. So, whether that is you're going to go the route of getting them on your email list and then sending them emails with new blog posts to look at, or if that's simply this is another great blog post, be sure to check it out if you like this one. You want to align that call to action with your strategy. Now when you come to launches or you've got other promotions going on, your call to action might be aligned with those goals. But for the overall goal, those would be two different ways you can do that call to action if your goal is to get more views on your blog.

[00:23:30.040] - Amanda
Then you're going to look at your topic. If you know what your call to action is, you know where they're leading them. Okay, well, what topic can you talk about within your niche? What small bitesized idea can your content surround that's going to lead to that call to action? And then once you know your topic and your call to action, you're going to determine your hook, which is the very first thing that you say in order to draw in your people.

[00:23:53.880] - Amanda
We want to say goodbye to the, hi, I'm so and so, let's chat about X type of intro. We don't want to do that. We want to pull people in, so that they can't stop reading. And once you've finalized your long-form content, then you're going to finalize your email newsletters, and you're going to base your email newsletters off of your long-form content. But maybe you've got a call to action with a different CTA.

[00:24:16.860] - Amanda
Call to action with different CTA. You've got a different CTA within your email newsletter because a reminder of a promo. Make sure you're looking at the calendar as you're creating your CTA, your topic in your hook for your newsletters, but save yourself some time and energy and base it off of your long-form content. Same thing with your social media. Base it off of your long-form content.

[00:24:35.970] - Amanda
But remember to check for those reminders and promos. Okay. That was a lot in not a lot of time. So, let's recap this really quickly. When it comes to creating a strategic content plan, first, you're going to do a goal check in. You're going to look at your goals and you're going to break them down.

[00:24:53.820] - Amanda
Then you're going to do goal mapping and you're going to say, this is where I'm at. This is where I need to be. These are some ways I might get there. Then you're going to look at your calendar and you're going to map out your calendar. You're going to start with your personal life.

[00:25:06.430] - Amanda
Then you're going to add in your work life, and then you're going to add in promotions and monthly efforts. Phase four is really determining what those monthly efforts are going to be and finalizing them. How can you grow, how can you partner with your content marketing in order to grow your efforts? Those monthly efforts are going to partner with your content marketing in order to grow your business, grow your reach. And then finally, you're going to take everything that you mapped out and you're going to create your content plan, and then you're going to use that plan to create your strategy.

[00:25:47.140] - Amanda
And as a reminder, we do it this way in this order because we want to fit your marketing into your business without it taking over your business. We don't want your marketing to take over your business, and we don't want your business to take over your life.
