Hello there. Hi, everyone, welcome to this Niche selection masterclass brought to you by my new workbook, Nail Your Niche. And today I'm going to share with you my little process of narrowing down your niche, finding the pockets of money so that you can continue to create the content that you love, but actually make some money from it as well. So, we're going to find your profitable niche in today's masterclass.

[00:00:37.510] - Mo
So, I'm a blog coach. My name is Mo from Blogwithmo.Com, and I actually take bloggers through my process of monetizing a blog. And I want to emphasize my process because there are many ways to monetize your blog, your digital space, you know, your YouTube channel, your Instagram page. There are many ways to skin the cat, as cruel as that sounds. So, I have developed a system that works well for me. I've done it over a few different blogs and different niches. And now I've helped quite a few creators to work through the system and figure out how to profitably, you know, blog, profitably blog and do what you love, but make money from it, because if you ever started a blog before, you know how much work goes into it. And so what I want to do is to ensure that while you're blogging and you're having fun doing that, you're actually making back some money as well, because blogging can get quite expensive as well.

[00:01:35.410] - Mo
So, let me just share with you a little bit about me. So you're like, OK, who is more? I've never heard about her before. Why is she qualified to tell me anything about selecting a profitable niche?

[00:01:47.260] - Mo
So, hello again. My name is Mo from Blogwithmo.com. I've said that a few times as well and I will say it a few more times. I'm in Kingston, Jamaica, so if you hear a little bit of an accent, that's where that is from. Born and raised here in the islands. And I a work from home. Mama. Welcome to my bedroom. I'm also a freelance writer. I write content for other businesses who want SEO content for their blogs. I'm a serial blogger. I have developed quite a few blogs now. I started out with a fashion blog highlighting Jamaican fashion many, many years ago, about twelve years to be exact. And then I had a child and so I transitioned into parenting like so many of us do. And then, you know, as we evolve and our hobbies change, my blogs kind of evolved. And so now I have a Kedo blog, I have a blog coaching business. I have a Jamaican travel blog, and I have a personal development blog.

[00:02:44.230] - Mo
So, I have developed blogs in quite a few niches. So I like to call myself a serial blogger because as I get interested in something else, I feel like I need to document the journey of me getting interested in this something else. But what I've done for myself is to be able to actually make a little bit of money on each of them, at least, so that it's a worthwhile experience for me, because, as I said, it takes a lot to actually create a blog and get people to read it and get people to listen to what you have to say. And so for all that time that I'm putting in, I want to share with you my process of actually making some money without being like sales and pushing stuff down your throat and that kind of thing.

[00:03:25.420] - Mo
So, in my blog coaching business, I have realized that many people struggle with the niche. And that's because you might occupy a broad category, you know, a space somewhat. But you're like, "Okay, I need to narrow down." You realize the need to narrow down to make some money and to have a focus to know where you're going. And that's where I have developed a cute little system that I want to share with you today. I think it's going to help you out a lot and help you to get that clarity of what next, where do I go with this and how do I make some money? That's all about- I'm all about the money girl.

[00:04:00.790] - Mo
So, I'm also a Keyword research ninja. What do I mean by that? You know, there are many ways to get traffic to your blog. You can do Pinterest. You can become an Instagram influencer. You can grow a humongous email list. There are many, many ways to get traffic to your blog. I prefer SEO. And so I do have SEO courses and keyword research master classes. I specialize in it because I find, as it says here, I'm a "passive income fiend". I find it's the most passive and also the most targeted traffic. You know, you're really targeting the people who are looking for the exact solution that you have. And so I love that because it's more of a traction marketing. You're attracting people to you instead of you constantly going out and getting new people to come to you every day. Right. Like an Instagram thing you have to post every day Pinterest. You have to post multiple times per day. It's a lot it's too much for me. And as someone with multiple businesses and I work from home. So, now my child is at home in quarantine life. So, I have to be able to make money while still living. I just I don't want to be in front of a computer all day. I don't want. Instagram all day. I mean, if you if you like that, and that's great, however, we all need to be able to make money in this digital space doing what we love. And Instagram is not my jam at all. I think it's something more casual for me. And so I love Keyword research and SEO and finding the things that people are searching for and giving them the content they're looking for, making some money doing that.

[00:05:32.100] - Mo
So, I'm going to share with you a little bit about all the things niche today. So what is a niche? Let's start with the basics, of course. And niche is a specialized segment of the market. And you see that I have underlined the word specialized because it's not enough to say that you are a parenting blog or you are a vegan blog or you are a health blog. You have to get a little bit more specialized than that. And it's not a category. It's not a broad topic at all. So, within parenting, there are so many ways that you could go. You could be just a pregnancy blogger. You could be a first year as a first step. You could be a food parenting blogger. What to teach, what to give your kids to eat. You could be a blogger into parenting niche for older kids like me, I struggle to find blogs that are talking about kids who are like preteens. And you know where I am at now. They think that by the time you reach this age, you're an expert, apparently, and that in it, if you're a vegan blogger, you still want to drill down a bit more. Are you a low carb vegan blogger or are you a easy meals vegan blogger? So if someone wants to transition to vegan food, you know, these are the meal plans and the recipes that are easy to make. Are you a gourmet vegan blog or do you specialize in holiday recipes?

[00:07:00.960] - Mo
You know, they're tiny little pockets all out there. And I find the tinier you get is the more profitable the niche is. And so let's get into exactly how specific we want to get with our niche, because parenting is not a niche. Veganism is not a niche. Health blogging, none of them. They're not niche is they're the broad category which are niche sits in. You are going to try and drill down over the course of your whole blogging and your Instagram and all of that. You are going to find it necessary to drill down and actually nail a niche. And so that's what this whole masterclass is about. It's really helping you to drill down and get to the nitty gritty of where your tribe is, where your community is, where your followers are, where your fans are, your readers are, and people who are going to line your pocket because parenting and even blogging is it.

[00:07:56.670] - Mo
You know, I'm one of my main blogs is in the blogging space and I am a blogger about blogging. But blogging is not a niche. What aspect of blogging do I help people with? Right now? I'm drilling down into niching. And you know why? Because I found out long ago that helping new bloggers is really where the passion for me is, because I was that new blogger many moons ago trying to figure out my space and myself and know that I'm a little bit more seasoned and I've crafted out some systems and some funnels and some strategies for myself. I want to share those things because there is enough food in the pot for everybody to eat. And so I've always believed in not hiding any of these secrets. I strongly believe in helping new bloggers. And so, that's the whole point of my blog, helping other bloggers to figure out how to monetize their digital space and make money. And so even within the blogging sphere, I nailed down, I reached down into helping new bloggers to monetize. Those two are very important for my niche.

[00:09:01.950] - Mo
I help new bloggers to monetize because not every blogger is actually in it for the money. And so how specific do you want to get? You don't want to drill all the way down. But let's talk a little bit about that specificity. I knew I was going to mess up on that word because your niche is your segment of the market. It's going to be bound by characteristics that are unique. So, when you find that community that you're building, you will realize that you all have a special bond together and it's easier to sell to them when you're all like a sure, we're all vegans, but that's still too broad.

[00:09:39.330] - Mo
In order to actually make some money, you're going to really want to drill down and find that little specialization, that segment of the market, that there is a common thread. And because you found that common thread and you've become their leader of that common thread, then they start to look to you for the solutions. Because within the common thread of whatever your niche is, there are problems and you will be the one who will lead them. You'll be their facilitator. Your audience will be brought together by a common identity and you will be the one providing solutions to their needs. And I have a very, very unique way to find it. Don't worry about it. We are going to get into the process of actually finding that common thread within your niche. But right now, before we do that, I want you to let me know what you have identified as your niche right now. So put that down in the chat below. Leave some comments. Let me hear what your niche is. If you have pen and paper, which I hope you brought to this session, I want you to jot down your niche right now. It's going to be interesting to see if after we go through the process, your niche changes or you find that you want to go in a different direction. So, let me hear what your niche is and jotted down right now. And before we get into the process, I just want to reach out to you and tell you that we are about to get into the integral part of selecting your niche.

[00:11:00.630] - Mo
So, I'm going to ask you, please turn off all your distractions, close out the million tabs, put the phone away. I'm about to give you the secret sauce and you're going to want to pay attention, in especially this next few slides. Okay.

[00:11:16.680] - Mo
So, here is my little I call it my outline, my ultimate guide to my funnel for finding what your niche is. You're going to start with your broad topic. Whatever you wrote down just now, hopefully it fits into the equation. The ultimate guide to X. What was your X? Did you identify a niche? Because one thing I want to say to you is that I realize that many, many bloggers are are occupying a space that is not providing a solution. And one of the reasons why I prefer SEO is because the most profitable blogs out there are the ones that answers questions. They provide solutions. When I type something into Google, it's a problem that I have. It's something that I want to find.

[00:12:04.530] - Mo
If you are able to give me the answer to that question and you do it well enough that Google actually puts you on page one of the the results, then you have something that we can work with here. We can monetize that. And so we're going to start with fleshing out your niche by starting with the ultimate guide to X. Now, in this example, I'm using homesteading. I don't know anything about homesteading. I'm a city girl at heart.

[00:12:32.580] - Mo
So, this is how I fleshed out the niche. If I would want to enter a space, the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to Google it and I'm going to see what else comes up. And I found a few homesteading books and it helped me to flesh this out. So, of course, in any ultimate guide, you're going to start with what is X? And so I start with what is homesteading? And then I moved, you know, how to get started with homesteading. And then within that, you're going to go into things like building your shelter for your animals, whether it's a barn or, you know, a chicken coop or whatever, and you're going to go into things like disposing of waste water management, raising animals, because if you know nothing about homesteading like I did, it's like having a little farm at home or, well, not at home. You're living in the country. You have a lot of land and you want to raise animals. You want to grow crops because you want to kind of live off grid or semi off grid. You don't want to be to actually have to go to the market every week and buy food. You're doing everything for yourself. And so these are all the topics that would fall under homesteading. And your goal is always to get to the end product. What is the moneymaking post that will be in this niche? And so I can already see a few here.

[00:13:44.220] - Mo
I see things like tools and resources. If I'm just starting as a homesteader, I might need a few tools. I'm going to need a garden fork and a wheelbarrow and all these things right just off the top of my head. For food preservation, I might need some canning stuff and some, I don't know, for seed storage. Maybe there's a better type of container to store my seeds there. There is just a lot going on. I'm already seeing where this niche can be profitable because I'm seeing some affiliate related posts way down the line somewhere. Right. And so that's just a start of fleshing out or a niche.

[00:14:22.740] - Mo
Now, how to find your subtopics. If you have no clue, you're going to do what I did and you're going to Google it. But step one really should be you start with your own ideas because you're already in this space. You're already in the niche, maybe in the broad category. And so write down what your own ideas are. Of course, number one is going to be what is or, you know, the benefits of the basics, too. So, that's going to always be sub topic number one. But what else? Write down your own ideas, then Google the rest. You absolutely do not want to skip Googling. I know some people get they get a reservation there because they think that they are going to be tainted by other people's ideas and that's not it at all. You're not copying anybody's ideas. What you want to make sure. Is that your guide is as holistic as possible, you are covering every single topic under the sun, because if someone is out there looking for this key word, that means that Google has determined that anyone who searches for that keyword, these are the topics that they want to see.

[00:15:26.120] - Mo
So, you don't want to miss the mark. If there are topics out there that other people are writing about and its ranking. And number one, you want to open up those things and see what their subtopics are. Make sure it's somehow aligned with what you've already written down. And if there's anything that you've missed, then you write it down. So, for instance, if I had started with my homesteading niche and I had everything about animals and I had a few things about planting crops, but I didn't have anything about waste management, that would have been a big missed opportunity for me. And so it's not that I'm taking their content. I'm just saying, "Okay, I need to write about waste management as well. And I'm putting it in my ultimate guide outline." So, make sure you you write everything down and then what you want to do is to identify your pillars.

[00:16:11.020] - Mo
What I mean by your pillars? So within the outline, if you really have a look at that outline, you realize that there are some big humongous topics in there. There are some topics that you are not going to necessarily cover. And that one ultimate guide, you're going to need to break them out and they're going to be their own articles. And that's what I'm referring to when I say Pillar's things like raising animals or disposing of waste. These are huge topics that you can veer off into all kinds of little pockets and talk about for themselves. You know, I've broken it down a little bit here so you can see some other topics that might come under raising animals or disposing of waste. And so these are homesteading pillars, but you can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with breaking out content from your ultimate guide. Because have a look once more at the guide. I want you to realize that each topic, each sub topic on my outline can be its own article. And that is the whole point of writing the ultimate guide. You want to come up with a bank of content that supports each other, that interconnects interlinks. It's showing Google your authority. Every single topic is something that you can break out and write about on its own, because this helps you to build authority in Google's eyes and in your readers eyes. You are going to become the leader. You now know so much about homesteading or whatever your topic is that you have written about it from end to end. And so Google has recognized that, you know what you're talking about. And your audience, they keep coming back for more because your topics are so good and so meaty and you're answering exactly what they're looking for because you've already done your research and realized that people who are searching for the ultimate guide to X, these are all the topics that they want to know information on.

[00:18:07.480] - Mo
So, you're going to write that ultimate guide post at some point and then you're also going to write about all those subtopics. And over some time, as you start to write all that content, the magic will happen. You will start to see the data pointing you in a different direction. And this, my friends, is the secret sauce to this whole thing, because, remember, homesteading is not a niche. It is a category. It is the broad category that the outline was written. And this is when you're confused, you have no idea where to pivot. But, you know, you want to be in homesteading somewhere. This is not your niche yet, my friends. This is just the category that you're sitting in. But over time, as you're writing these articles, Google and your audience will start to tell you where to pivot. You will realize that you start getting more and more comments about one particular thing. Or when you wrote one blog post, it gets twenty one comments, whereas the others get one or two. Or when you post something to Instagram in support of your blog post, everyone starts to interact with one particular topic more and more and more. On Google side, you realize that certain articles rank much faster than others. You know, these are ranking higher. Every time you write a post about that topic, it ranks more.

[00:19:33.970] - Mo
So, in your search console when you look at the keywords that people are using to find you, it's all skewed to one particular area of homesteading, that is your niche. Go down that road and follow the money because this now is not you throwing anything on the wall and seeing what sticks. Something has stuck my friends and data is telling you where to go. There is nothing more profitable than research than doing something that data tells you to do. And so if you really want to make money as a blogger, you start by writing all those foundational articles and then listening, watching the data and seeing where it's telling you to go.

[00:20:18.800] - Mo
So, here's what I want you to do. This is a little secret of mine that I'm sharing with you when you write your ultimate guide outline. Not the post yet. Not the article, not the big thing. You write the outline, you see a few money posts. Didn't we see a few money posts in the outline? Maybe some things about seed storage, maybe some things about the tools and resources that a new homesteader will need; write those first. Yes, Write those posts first identify the posts that are likely to make money and write them first.

[00:20:55.970] - Mo
Why on earth would I ever tell you to do that? Well, if you know anything about SEO, you know that SEO is a long game. You're not going to write anything today and it ranks tomorrow unless you already have like a super, you know, a super large following a super large blog. You're already established. And girl, this master class is not for you, girl. Share some tips with me. But if you're a new blog or a new content creator and you have your outline, this is why it's so important to always, always, always start with an outline. Whether you're trying to find your niche or whether you're writing one particular article, you always want to start with you outline because you always want to see where the money is.

[00:21:38.120] - Mo
So, write those posts first. So, yes, if you have a new blog on homesteading, write 10 tools and resources that a new homesteader will need. It doesn't look weird. It doesn't. I hear you. I hear you. Oh, my God. I start with the money post first. I need to introduce the topic. I need to tell them what homesteading is. No, you don't need to tell anybody because as a new blogger, you have a grand total of two point five people reading your blog. So, don't worry about that. We have long gone past days when bloggers, you know, you had an audience and they come in and check your blog every morning to see what new you've posted. That's not what a blog is anymore. And the only thing I used to do that way was back in the day when I used to follow these gossip blogs. And you wanted to see what the latest news is. There is nobody coming to your blog every single morning to see what new you've posted.

[00:22:28.550] - Mo
Write those money making blog posts, let them sit and age so they will start to rank. The more you read the supporting posts that help them, the more you link to them from your supporting post, the more you start to write those informational posts that's meant to bring to traffic in, the more the the money will start to rock and start to make you money.

[00:22:50.030] - Mo
Listen, I'm breaking out the Jamaican patois in a few because I get so passionate about this topic, because it works. It works like magic and it makes me passive income as much as as much as that sounds very cliché right now, money flows for our school. Just- just try let's see what it's going to do because it works. I stand by this. I'm letting you know this is a little secret of mine. If you check any of my blogs, you will see some random moneymaking posts, some of them that do not even have like the supporting articles behind them yet. That's fine. Let them sit out there and age. And once I start to write the supporting pieces behind them, the whole blog just starts to lift all together. I'm starting to make money. I'm starting to get traffic. It just all works. So, synchronously, is that the word? Everything just starts going really, really well. So guys, follow the money, write those posts first and work backwards, because when you have an outline, you can see everything that you're supposed to write. So, write them first and go backwards.

[00:23:55.220] - Mo
So, takeaway. I want you to write your outline, make sure you write the ultimate guide outline and then identify the money posts and write those first guys. Just trust me on this one, just go with it. And then you write your supporting pieces, all of the other ones that were there. And then you start to pay attention to the data because the outline you have at least twenty articles. So, this is not something that you're- unless you are about to take vacation and just sit down and crank out some content, I don't know twenty articles will take me at least 20 weeks to write because my articles are in depth. They are well, some of them are in depth. They are super. But these articles that you're about to write, it's super important then that you take time to research them properly and write amazing pieces of content, because these are your pillar post. These are where all of your little side business and hustles will come from. These are where all of the little- this is where all the data will come from. This is where all of your audience will be built. It's super important to write these twenty posts for a set of posts very, very well. And then just pay attention to the data. Make sure you install Google search console. Make sure that everything is set up for your analytics to be recording what's working on your blog so that you can start to listen to Google and figure out where that big pivot is.

[00:25:22.440] - Mo
So, if you need a little bit more help with this concept, I invite you to check out my Nail your Niche workbook. Now, the workbook is like 40 pages long. It goes so much more in-depth into this whole process. It helps you to identify your target audience. There are spaces for you to do your ultimate guide so, you can print it out and write it off. There are exercises there, examples. So, I do the exercises first and then you can have blank pages so you can follow on if you know you needed that extra help, extra explanation on what to do. It goes far in depth and it helps you to really and truly nail your niche, find the money, follow the money and find those are the pockets of profitability within your niche that's kind of untapped. Because that's the beauty of actually doing the outlines, is you're really starting to see that, you know, this is a corner of my niche, I don't see anyone out there exploring this little pocket in depth. And the more you get in depth in those little corners is the more money you make. I tell you, the tiniest niches make the biggest money.
