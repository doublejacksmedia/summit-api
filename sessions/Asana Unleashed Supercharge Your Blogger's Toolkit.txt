Hi, everyone. I'm really excited to be here. I'm Carrie Wulf, Founder of Wulfden Professional Solutions. I am a retired military spouse, a mom to three, a grammy of three, and a mom to three fur-babies. I discovered my love of systems and organization years and years ago as I was coordinating all of these cross-country moves with a family of five, plus our pets, plus special education needs. It took a lot of organization, but I have turned that love of organization and systems into my business. Now I am a fractional operations and project manager who likes to get nerdy by building out workflows and mapping out procedures and building out KPI tracking dashboards. If you want to connect with me on social or learn more about me, scan that QR code on your screen right quickly, and that will take you to a place where you can find all the places that I am at.

[00:01:23.370] - Carrie Wulf
As I began dipping my toes into the world of operations and project management, I tried out several different project management systems. I was trying Trello, I tried ClickUp, and Base Camp, and Airtable, and they were either too robust for what I needed or they just couldn't do what I wanted. I finally landed on that one that I love, and I've been using it for the past three years, and that would be Asana. I'm sure that you are wondering what in the world a project management tool has to do with blogging, but for me, it had everything to do with blogging. I learned how to leverage Asana to supercharge and organize my blogging research, my topics, and all my resources into a massive workflow and research library. Setting up my blogging with Asana really lets me plan out my weekly and monthly blogs with a high level of organization that both my blog writer and myself can follow.

[00:02:34.980] - Carrie Wulf
Today, I want to share my Asana blogging system with you. I was facing several challenges as I was trying to get my blog up and running, but also trying to work for clients and build my business. But these were the big three challenges that I was running into. I was having trouble with my time management. It was really a struggle for me to find the time to research and write a really good blog article. Then I struggled with my content organization. I had a stack of notebooks and a stack of sticky notes. Sticky notes were everywhere, and they were not helping me keep all of my topics and my content pillars in any kind of organizable fashion. Because I struggled with my time management and my content organization, that also meant I was struggling with consistency, trying to blog, trying to run the business and work with clients. It just wasn't working. I needed to find a better way. There had to be a better way for me to organize all of this, make it work. One day, I was working in a client's Asana account for their project, and I thought, Why don't I use Asana to get my blogging app together? That is what I did.

[00:04:07.440] - Carrie Wulf
But there are so many features to Asana. It's really easy to get overwhelmed if you've never used a platform like that before. As I was setting up my system, these are the features that I use the most. I really rely on those project boards to keep my blog workflow in one area and my content resource library in another. Those project boards are really key for the organization. But then I also keep things in the Board View. You'll see in a minute when I show you Asana, but I'm a visual person. Looking at things as one long list was just not doing it for me. I really needed to see it all laid out in the Board View. Then there's the Task Cards that help me keep all my topics and all my content organized. There's Template Cards available. Then I really rely on the Due Date function.

[00:05:09.930] - Carrie Wulf
I want to give you a sneak peek or a look behind the curtain, if you will, into what exactly my Asana looks like from the user viewpoint. This is my blog newsletter board. This is where I keep all of my monthly and weekly topics and everything highly organized. In this first column here, you'll see I've got a card for my SOPs. Any SOPs that are related to writing your blog post to SEO-ing it or loading it to your website, you can link all of that here. I've also got a Wounded Warrior banner page. I support and promote the Wounded Warrior program. I want to make sure that my blog writer has access to all of that information as she's writing out blogs. Then I've got my affiliate links. You might be thinking, Why do I have affiliate links on my blog page or my blogging board? That is because I promote affiliate products not only to my email list, but also in my blog. I want to make sure my blog writer has access to that. But I don't want to have to chase them down everywhere. She does not have access to all of my Asana workspaces. You'll notice that some of these have colored bars, and that indicates that the card also lives on a different board. If you open up the card, you'll see I can link my affiliate link here. But then this card also lives on my business dashboard. Now, that is a board that is private to myself, and my blog writer doesn't have access to it. I need these cards to live in a place where both she has access here and I have access on the dashboard. That's why there's a colored bar. That's also one of the features I love about Asana is that I can make these cards live in multiple places.

[00:07:29.130] - Carrie Wulf
This column here is my list of blogs to write. When I'm planning out my blogs, I do it by the month. Then for that month, there's a topic, and then I break it down further by each week. When I open up a blog card, this is what it looks like. You'll see that it lives in my Overwatch board, which is where my operations keeps an eye on everything all in one place. We'll see here, it is assigned to my blog writer. We've got the month and what the theme is for all of the blogs in that month. It's got all the information that she might need as she's writing out the blog. Then here you'll see as subtasks are each week in the month and what the topic is. You'll notice that there are two dates. I always put the publish date ahead of the topic, and then I put a due date on the subtask. The publish date, obviously, is when the blog is going to publish on the website, but the due date I assign to the subtask is when I have to have that copy to me for review. Now, if you're working with different copywriters or team members, you can also assign people on these subtasks. But this is how I track all of my blogs. But I don't create these cards from scratch every single month. That would be a nightmare. I have one card that is what I call my Template Card. Then I just duplicate this card each time I'm getting ready to plan out a month. I duplicate the task, I update it with the new month's name, and I create the task. It's going to take just a minute and it'll start popping in there as things populate. Then all I have to do is rinse and repeat. I add the month, I add topics, and then I go through here and add the publishing date and the topics. One of the great things I love is that you can add subtasks to a subtask. I also utilize subtasks for the research. As my blog writer is looking at it, she sees what the topic is, I have also provided her with the research. As I'm figuring out what I want to write about and doing the research, I always link it here in the subtasks-subtask. That way, when she goes to write it, all she's got to do is click this and she's got all the information that she needs to get that article ready to go.

[00:10:39.480] - Carrie Wulf
You might be wondering, where do I keep all of that research and information as I'm planning out my blogs? Well, the answer to that would be in my research library. This is my research library. This is the Big Kahuna, was what I like to call it. I have lots of different topics and content pillars that I like to blog and talk about. I organize all of the research and information into this research library. You'll see here, I've got just like on the blog workflow, we had the resources. This one is called the article parking lot. As I'm reading emails and newsletters and blogs and I see an article that I want to keep because it pertains to the topic I want to write about or it's a topic I write frequently about, I want to send that to the Assignment Board. Each column is a different topic pillar that I frequently blog or talk about in my blogs. But I want to make sure I'm populating that with research so that when I get ready to write about something or if I'm struggling on a topic idea, I can always come into this research library and have that information right at hand.

[00:12:12.240] - Carrie Wulf
The easiest way to start building your research library is by using the Asana Chrome extension. You want to navigate over to the Chrome Web Store. This says remove from Chrome only because I've already added it there. Once you add to Chrome, it's going to show up here in your Chrome toolbar. If you don't see this in your toolbar, you might need to pin it. You can do that by going to the puzzle piece and then looking for the Asana extension and just click that blue thumb tack, and that's going to pin it right up here to your toolbar.

[00:13:05.750] - Carrie Wulf
Like I said, as I'm reading and surfing the web and reading newsletters, I find an article that I want to send to my research board. This is one that was in my inbox recently, and I want to save it because these are topics I frequently speak about and blog about. But I don't want to do the whole copy. Go to Asana, open a task card, paste it in. There's a much easier way and it's magical. I'm going to click my Asana extension and it's going to pop out a window. Now, if you are an Asana frequent flyer, meaning if you're in multiple Asana workspaces, just make sure that the one displayed here is the one you need it to be. Make sure it's your own Asana workspace before you start sending things to it. You can assign it to a team member right from this pop-up window if you want. But I'm going to put it into the project. The project I'm sending it to is my research library. Just type in the first few letters and click on research library. You'll see here it's going to the research library and it's going into the article parking lot. Then I want to click on this link because that's going to link the current web page that I'm on. You'll notice that it has added the title of the article as the title of the card and it has this big link. Now, before I click Create task, remember that it's showing up in the article parking lot. I'm going to create the task. Now, let's pop back over to Asana. There it is. The website we were just on is now in the article parking lot. The reason I have this very first column labeled parking lot is because anytime you use the Chrome extension, it's going to send whatever web page you're using it on, it's going to populate in this first column always. On all of my boards, it's either labeled resources or parking lot or brain dump, idea spot, whatever you want to call it. Just remember that when you use that extension, it's always going to send them to this first column. Then all you have to do is once a week, if I'm being honest, it's probably monthly for me, you just go in and you sort. It's a simple grab and drag.

[00:16:12.170] - Carrie Wulf
Let's see. This one is about Google productivity. I want to grab it, and I'm just going to slide it over here to Google Workspace, and that's where it's at. That's all you got to do to create your library is just drag these research articles into the topic or content pillar that they talk about. Then when you are ready to reread the article, all you've got to do is open the card. If you highlight the link and you right-click and then go to, it is going to open up that article that you saved. It could be a year ago, but now you're ready to read it or use it in your content, and there you go. It's a huge, huge time saver to do that.

[00:17:14.860] - Carrie Wulf
Now that I've shown you the Chrome extension and I've shown you how to set up a blog workflow and a research library, there are some integrations that Asana uses that are incredibly helpful to really streamline and optimize your blogging system. Some of the integrations Asana works with, there are tons. But for communication, you can connect your Evernote or your MS Teams right into your Asana account and communicate back and forth that way. I frequently use it with Slack. There is a Slack integration. As I'm working with different team members and there's a comment or something in Slack and I want to put it in Asana, I can use that integration and send it directly in there without having to copy and paste. You can also directly link your Loom videos. If you're making an instructional video or a quick video note, you can connect that as well. As far as file storage goes, Asana integrates wonderfully with everything in the Google-verse, the Drive, your Docs, your Sheets, you can connect pretty much anything in Google to your Asana. You can also connect it to Dropbox or your OneDrive. Asana really has a lot of integrations that will help you stay organized and streamline your entire blogging process.

[00:18:51.570] - Carrie Wulf
One of the great things I like about Asana is that the Project Cards or the Task Cards really give you a lot of options to make sure everyone is on the same page. You're able to assign it to a primary team member. You can set your due dates. You can give instructions or link any other relevant information. You can even create those subtasks with individual topics and assignments and due dates. It allows you to open up those subtasks and add even more information. If you're working with a copywriter or graphics or social media promotion, you can add those steps as subtasks and really dial in your process so that there is not a step that gets forgotten along the way.

[00:19:48.470] - Carrie Wulf
But I know that all of this probably is coming at you like a firehose. If you're completely unfamiliar with project management systems, this is pretty overwhelming. I don't want you to be overwhelmed. I want you to be able to take action and get this set up in your accounts quickly. If you scan the QR code that's on your screen, that will take you to a place to sign up and grab a workbook. Inside that workbook, I talk about Asana in a little bit more in-depth, but I've also linked some templates for you. It's a really easy… Click the link, download the file, and then I have instructional videos that walk you through each board and how they work and how to import those boards into your Asana account. I know this was a lot of information, but please grab that workbook because it's got individual videos for each board that talks about the board, how they work, and how to put that into your own Asana account. I want you to be able to get started with this right away and not put it off until maybe next week or next month when you have time. Those links give you the ability to get started on it right away.

[00:21:14.730] - Carrie Wulf
I want to thank everyone for attending today. I know it's a new year and we're all excited to hit the ground running and get stuff going. We're really just pumped up to start the year out fresh. I just want to say thanks for listening, for taking the time out. Please make sure you download that workbook so that you can really start putting these action steps into practice and get your blogging workflow set up and dialed in.
