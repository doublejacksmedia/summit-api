All right, guys. I'm excited for this next session with Monica Louie, who is a Facebook ads expert. So, Monica, first, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate you taking the time.

[00:00:11.110] - Monica Louie
Well, thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited to be a part of this.

[00:00:14.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, because I know, I remember one year, probably multiple years, at FinCon, you did a session, and it was packed through the door and I couldn't get in. And so I didn't get to watch it. I saw a friend in there and I was like, Can you send me your notes afterwards? I'm really excited to get to do this with you now.

[00:00:33.120] - Monica Louie
Well, thank you. Thank you. I love teaching about Facebook ads. I mean, it's my passion. It's what I do all day. I'm super excited to be here.

[00:00:42.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So before we dive in that, can you give us a little bit of your background, how you came to be known as I feel like you're one of the go-to people for Facebook ads and some of the highlights of what you want to make sure we cover today.

[00:00:55.610] - Monica Louie
Sure. I'm Monica Louie, and I started off in the online world with a personal finance blog back in, let's see, 2013, actually, I ended up putting my corporate job to stay home with my kids. So in 2013, I had a toddler and another one on the way. We felt like it was a good time to make that transition. When I was pregnant with my son, we had started to plan for the transition of me eventually being able to stay at home. We tried to be smart about it. We paid off our car, we built up some savings. By the time I was pregnant with my daughter, my husband had gotten a promotion, and we felt like the numbers were aligning that we could make it work. My goal in staying at home was not... I wanted to spend more time with my kids and not be tied to the commute and the corporate schedule and demands on my time. I wanted to have more flexibility on my schedule, but I also knew that I wanted to find a way to make money on my own schedule. With that, that's when I found the online world and started learning about making money blogging and online.

[00:02:07.770] - Monica Louie
But a couple of months in to me staying at home, we realized that we were dipping into our savings, and that was not the direction that we wanted to go. We wanted to keep that savings there. We didn't want it to deplete it. I was like, okay, well, I'm going to figure this out because I'm determined to not go back to after I have this baby and I want to stay home, I want to have my own schedule. I was like, I'm going to figure it out because I don't want my desires to cause financial strain for my family. I ended up diving into the personal finance world and found that not only were people staying afloat on a single middle class income, but people were also paying off massive amounts of debt. That really inspired both my husband and me to pay off our debt because we saw the freedom that if we didn't have the debt hanging over us, we could have so much more money to do with as we please. We just felt like that would make us feel so free to get rid of the debt. We started to hit it hard.

[00:03:11.460] - Monica Louie
We actually created this big goal of paying off all of our debt, including our mortgage by the time we turned 40. We were 32 at the times. We were like, okay, eight years. We didn't stop to think to do the math about what that would mean. How much per year do we have to pay off? Is that feasible? Is that realistic? We were just like, we know people are doing it. We're going to do it. We ended up paying off $120,000 of debt in two years all on a single middle class income. I do like to share, like my husband is not a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer, he's in law enforcement, so very much a middle class income. As his coworkers who make roughly around the same as he does, started asking, How are you doing this? Because they knew that I had just started staying home, and then all of a sudden we were paying off all this debt and we were being very intentional. So that's where I was like, okay, I can start helping people online with helping them get out of debt. So that brought me into the FinCon community.

[00:04:08.480] - Monica Louie
From there, I started following Pat Flynn and Amy Porter-Field. From Amy Porter-Field, I learned the power of webinars and the power of Facebook ads. In reaching more people for a relatively low cost, you can find your target audience via the power of social media. So I followed Amy's approach and had really great success with driving traffic via Facebook ads to my first webinar at the end of 2015. Then I did it again and lowered my cost even further at the beginning of 2016. From there, people in the FinCon community, Principal Finance Network online, started asking me for help with their Facebook ads. At first I was very resistant. I was like, Oh, I just know it works for me. It worked well. I was pleased, but I wasn't ready to step into that role as experts. But then as more people started reaching out and I was very upfront with my experience. Then I started working with people on their Facebook ads, and we started getting really great results and doing a bunch of different strategies. Then by the end of 2016, I just realized that I really enjoyed helping other business owners grow their businesses online through the power of high converting Facebook ads.

[00:05:22.430] - Monica Louie
Now my team and I also specialize in Instagram ads as well. By the end of 2016, I sold my blog. And jumping into 2017, I've been a full-time Facebook ads Coach, teacher, mentor, speaker. And- now we have an ads management agency, so I have a growing team. And it's been a lot of fun.

[00:05:47.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. No, I think that's amazing. And I think that's where a lot of people start out online is realizing they can create a schedule on their terms, which fuels that motivation. So okay, as far as Facebook ads go, because I know a lot of people are nervous about them because they have to spend money, right? They've been pinning for forever and Pinterest is great. I just recorded a session on that. But even you could do ads on Pinterest, Instagram and things like that. And that's where people really hang out, is Facebook and Instagram. I realized the other day I was like, I've been on Facebook for almost 15 years since 2005. And I was like, that's almost half my life at this point back in college. But Facebook, one of the things I like about Facebook is because I think people think ads have to be super expensive, and that's not necessarily the case. And I think you, correct me if I'm wrong, are really good at helping people set up ads that are affordable for them.

[00:06:47.510] - Monica Louie
So.

[00:06:47.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Where would you suggest someone start in terms of they've never done a Facebook ad? How do they decide what to run the ad to? How much they want to... Just where should we start?

[00:06:59.420] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So the first step, so before we even get to what do I do with Facebook ads? How do I even dive in there? The first step I always say is to install the pixel on your site. So if you have a Facebook page, then you can create an ad account, and with your ad account, then you'll have a Facebook pixel code that is tied to your ad account. It sounds all techy, but believe me, I'm not super techy. It's not any.

[00:07:27.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Different from having to install Google Analytics, really.

[00:07:30.930] - Monica Louie
Exactly. It's the same thing. So you get a piece of code that Facebook gives you, and you just put that on the back end of your website and all of your landing pages. And so that's the first step. Even if you're like, I think I might do Facebook ads someday. I always encourage people. Yeah, Yeah, to just install it, and that will allow your website to communicate with Facebook so that you have some data to work with when you're ready to dive in. So assuming we've got the pixel installed and we're all good to go there, then we want to break down the strategy. So what do I actually want to do? What do I want to get out of my ads? What is my goal? So as bloggers, we have a lot of different goals. So we might want to just drive traffic to just get more eyes on our blog or our latest blog post, or we might want to grow our email list so that we can grow that audience that we're connected to that we can continue to build a relationship with. Or maybe we have products we want to sell.

[00:08:24.390] - Monica Louie
So get really clear on what your goal is. And if you've never run Facebook ads before, then I always like to start with driving traffic and just keeping it simple. So creating a traffic campaign is one of the simplest campaigns that you can create. And so what I do, and I do this a lot with my clients and with my students, is we select a blog post that if it's monetized, then great, you can make a little bit of money from driving traffic to your blog post. If it's not and it's just something that you want to get more eyes out there, you think it's a great piece of content and you really want more people to see it, whatever your goal is with that, choose a blog post. And if it's already doing well on social media, it's one of your most repinned pins, or it's something that you post on Facebook in your group or something, and it just goes wild, right? Yeah. So it's already getting great engagement. That's a good place to start, because obviously on Facebook, people are there to be social, and they engage more with attention-grabbing content as opposed to like the, this is how you do X, Y, Z.

[00:09:29.400] - Monica Louie
So choose your post, and then you can drive traffic to it. A lot of my clients and students, we shoot to get traffic at less than 10 cents per page view. So that means people have clicked over and viewed the page view. It depends on what your niche is and how large a potential audience you have that will result in your cost. Of course, there's the targeting and the ad that goes along with that, and all plays a role. But if you have a larger potential audience, like in the money space, a lot of people are interested, especially this time of year, in being more intentional with their money, their saving, getting out of debt, whatever it is, investing. So a lot of people, if you hit them when they're excited about doing all of that, then your cost will likely be lower.

[00:10:15.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah. And then, yeah, keep that in mind that goal is very important. So once you have that goal in place, you've got your pixel in place, how do you design your ad? I guess, because that is obviously going to be what entice people to go over. Yes, there's all the text set up behind the scenes of setting up the ad, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. But how do you design an ad that's going to convert and people actually clicking?

[00:10:40.570] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So that, again, comes down to the strategy. So if you're doing a traffic campaign like we're talking about, then that's going to be very different from if you're selling your product. Your ad is going to be doing different things. But the general premise of your ad is you want it to grab attention, and then you also want it to convert. Whatever that means, if that's just like a click-through to read your blog post or click through and purchase, click through and sign up for your email list, whatever it is, you want them to take that action. So the ad has to be eye-catching. We're all familiar with ads that we've seen come through our news feed. But if you think about your experience on Facebook, Facebook is a very busy place, and there are lots of things going on, lots of posts. Our friends post groups were a part of notifications, messages, events that were being invited to, lots of different things. So your ad has to stand out. And usually the way it does that is through the creative. So for a traffic campaign, again, just keeping it very simple, then we have tested this time and time again, and we find that a static image, just a single image in the ad converts better.

[00:11:47.510] - Monica Louie
And if it's brighter or has more contrast or some element that just stands out and catches your eye, that can help it to tell people, stop the scroll so that they pay attention to your ad. And so an exercise that I like to have people do is to just take a minute and scroll through your news feed and pay attention to when you pause or hesitate or something that grabs your attention. What is it about that post that's grabbing your attention? Is it the image or is it the headline? There were some words that jumped out at you. What was it about that? And then make note of that when you're going to design your ad of what will stand out and grab your target audience's attention. Yeah. And then-Oh, that's okay. And then when we have the image, then we have the copy around it. So we have a headline on Facebook. So that's a larger text below the image. And then we have for a traffic campaign. Again, we've tested this time and time again, we just use a single line of copy above the image, just something to pique their curiosity. So in the headline, we'll often say what the blog post is about.

[00:12:52.680] - Monica Louie
So that could be your blog title. It could be the exact same thing as your blog title, but something that will help entice them that this is something that they need to know more about. And then the little bit of copy above the image is just something to pique their curiosity to entice them to click over and read your blog post.

[00:13:11.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah. You're right. And it depends on the goal of your ad, but I feel like I see... So that's for a blog post for traffic or something. But sometimes you'll see just these walls of text in the ad, and some of them are really good, and I find myself reading through it. And then some of them I'm like, No. So copy does make a difference. Obviously, design and copy really need to be working together.

[00:13:38.920] - Monica Louie
Absolutely.

[00:13:39.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So you said a static image, would it be an image with any text on it?

[00:13:44.850] - Monica Louie
For the traffic strategy, again, we've tested that, and images without text work better.

[00:13:50.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, good to know. I think we are, as bloggers, very used to creating graphics that have an image of text. So good to know. Okay, so once you've got it designed, and would you recommend or do you with your clients have them test different ones? Because you can in the ad manager set up different graphics and copy and test what works better. To what extent do you do that? And how many different tests are you running at a time?

[00:14:17.630] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So that will come back down to your budget and how much you actually want to spend on your ad. So a lot of my students, they'll start off with $5 or $10 a day, and they might set up one test, one version of their or they might do two where they test a different image. But with our clients, we will set up multiple tests. We'll have various images, various headlines, add copy, and different combinations so that we can really narrow in on what is working the best, what's grabbing attention? Because oftentimes, as many years as experience as I have with this now, you can never really tell until you get it going what's really going to grab people's attention and convert the best. So that's why we do like to do a lot of different tests when we have the budget to work with.

[00:15:05.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And when you are doing tests, even if you're just testing one thing, how long do you test it for before you make a call on what works?

[00:15:14.300] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So that has changed over the years. So it used to be I would say, I'll give it at least 48 hours, 48 to 72, and you see what's working. Now it seems to be taking the algorithm a little bit longer. Not always, but we will run a test for at least seven days on our team, unless we're in a short promotion time period where we've got to make decisions faster because we are only promoting something for four days. But if we are doing an evergreen campaign where it's just going to be ongoing, we'll give it at least a full week just so that we can give the algorithm enough time to really assess what's working, who's clicking and who it needs to show the ad to. Because when you have your pixel placed and you're driving traffic to a landing page, you can tell Facebook that once people click on that landing page, that that's the goal that you want them to help you achieve, and the algorithm will help you find more of those people who are more likely to take that action. So whether it's clicking over to read a blog post or clicking over and signing up for your email list is as long as you have the pixel placed, you can tell Facebook.

[00:16:17.480] - Monica Louie
So that's another reason why you want the pixel installed. But over time, the algorithm, as it gets data, it will learn, and then it will help to prioritize showing those ads to the people who are more likely to take that action.

[00:16:29.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So it's not unusual to have to spend more to start to get those clicks because the idea is you make Facebook smarter at who to show your ads, and those costs should ideally go down.

[00:16:41.540] - Monica Louie
Absolutely. That is something that we always see is that cost will start higher, especially the first day, first few days, first few hours. Cost will start higher than we really want them to be. But then if we give a time, we'll see that the cost start to come down. And it may not be a perfect straight line down. There might be a day where it goes back up, but just be patient. Give it a little bit more time. You'll see the general trend is that it's coming down.

[00:17:06.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, definitely patience is always a struggle, right? So don't freak out about it if you're like, I was aiming for $0.10, and it's a dollar. It might be a dollar to start. Yeah. Okay. And then I think it's been a while since I've done a Facebook ad. So some of the things you have to decide on is your audience size and who you're targeting. So how can you walk us through some tips on how to do that?

[00:17:32.130] - Monica Louie
Yeah. Okay. So your audience, obviously think about... So when you're ad, you have your offer. So your offer is the blog post in our example, or it's your free lead magnet to grow your newsletter, or it's your paid product, whatever it is, that's your offer that you're presenting in your ad. So you need to think about, who is my offer right for? Obviously, so we need to think about our ideal audience. But then Facebook gives us a lot of different targeting options in order to create those audiences. So there are three main types of audiences, and the first type is a Custom Audience, and these are the people who know you in some way. So if you've got the pixel placed, you can create an audience of people who visited your website or specific pages on your website. So you can create an audience of people who visited that specific blog post. If you know it's already getting good traffic, you can create an audience of people who visited that specific blog post. You can also upload your email list to Facebook. You can create an audience of people who've engaged with your Facebook page.

[00:18:35.880] - Monica Louie
So you can target people who like your page, but you can also target an audience of people who've engaged with your Facebook page or your Instagram profile if it's an Instagram business profile. So that means that they don't even have to follow you or like your page. But if they've engaged and you can set the time frame up to 365 days. So if you want to say, I want people who've engaged with me in the last 30 days, then you can create that audience, or if you want a larger audience, you can create it up to 365 days. And so that means that people who've shown an interest in what you have to share, but just haven't hit the like button, you can get back in front of them. So we have a lot of different options there for the custom audiences. But those, again, are the people who have interacted with you or your brand in some way. Can I ask?

[00:19:20.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So if you have a smaller site, it could be you want the people in the last three days, but it's not really a lot of people. So what is the ideal audience size to be promoting to? How do you make that work? If you're like, Well, if they interacted six months ago, they may not remember who I am, what would you suggest in that case?

[00:19:43.130] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So for that case, that's where I like to... If you're starting off with smaller audiences, then that's where I like to use the lookalike audiences or the detailed targeting audiences. And so those are the other two types of audiences. So a lookalike audience, if you have some audience, so you're not starting from zero. Let's say you have even a few hundred people on your email list, and you're getting maybe a couple of thousand visitors to your blog a month. You can create those custom audiences, but then you can tell Facebook you want to create a lookalike audience from those audiences, which means that Facebook is going to look at that audience. So let's say we've uploaded our email list into Facebook, and Facebook does a pretty good job of matching the people that are on our email list with its Facebook users. So you've got your audience of your email list subscribers, and you say, I want to find more people like them, then Facebook will look at its entire pool of people on Facebook land, and you have to give it a region. So for most of us will probably be targeting the United States.

[00:20:45.910] - Monica Louie
So we'll look at the United States and say, okay, Facebook, find me the people who are most like these people in the United States. Then you have an option of 1-10 %, and that's just percentage of the population of that region on Facebook. So for Facebook, for the 18 and above audience, we know that there's 220 million Facebook users. So 1 % is going to give us an audience size of 2.2 million people. And so we'll start with that, the 1 % audience, unless we're working with a larger source audience. So if you have like 25,000 people on your email list that you're uploading, then we might test a 2, 3, 4, up to 5 % lookalike audience. But generally, if you're starting with a smaller size or a smaller source audience, then we'll stick with the 1 %. And so when you're creating your audiences, let's say you're using detailed targeting, that's where a lot of people think about when they think about Facebook targeting, they think about, Well, I can find people who like this TV show or this brand or whatever or follow this big site that has my audience. That's where you can plug in different interests and behaviors and demographics and really create a profile of your target audience.

[00:22:02.260] - Monica Louie
And so my order of priority is, if it makes sense, start with your warm audience. If your goal is to bring people back to whatever it is you're promoting, if your goal is to grow your audience, so I want to get more readers to my blog or more people on my email list who aren't there yet, who haven't joined yet, then I like to go with lookalike audiences if we have something to work with as far as the source audiences, the custom audiences. Otherwise, then we'll test the lookalike audiences, where we'll start with the keywords and the interests and create a profile. But then if we have more budget to work with, then I will test a mix of lookalike audiences and the detailed targeting audiences too. I'll throw on a couple of those. So does that answer your question? Yes.

[00:22:47.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that makes perfect sense because I think, yeah, I feel like that's the most overwhelming part of setting up an ad, is figuring out what audience you're doing it to.

[00:22:57.370] - Monica Louie
There's so many options. Yeah.

[00:22:59.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And it's easy to be like, okay, well, I want to set this budget for the campaign or whatnot, but figuring out your audience, I feel like, is the trickiest part. And I would almost think... Would you... Sorry, I'm thinking the best way to phrase this, because you might do a lookalike audience. But I've seen this in Facebook groups that I'm in where people are like, I just realized the people coming to my site are not at all the people I want to come to my site. So I feel like a lookalike audience in that instance may not be ideal. And then there's a lot of questions of like, okay, well, what content are you doing? You might need to tweak that. But would there be a time and place for when you're not using a customer lookalike audience. You're just going after completely doesn't match anything you have right now.

[00:23:51.690] - Monica Louie
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you're starting from scratch or maybe you're starting to talk about a new category to your site or you're branching off or you just know they're not the right people. The people that are coming to your site, like you said, they're not converting. They're just not my people. Then that's when I would start with a detailed targeting audience. One thing I do want to give you my rule of thumb, though, when it comes to making a decision about where to start with targeting. So if your goal is to grow your audience, let's say we go back to our example of driving traffic to our blog post. So let's say the blog post has already gotten some good traffic. It's already been shared on Pinterest, and we're getting Google traffic to it. Then I would create an audience of people who visited that specific blog post and then test to look like audience of those people. So I always ask myself when I'm starting a new campaign, what is the offer that I'm promoting? And do I already have a group of people who have already taken me up on that offer?

[00:24:49.110] - Monica Louie
Who've already read my blog post? Who've already joined my newsletter? Who've already downloaded that lead magnet? Who've already purchased that product? And then I see if I can create a lookalike audience from those people.

[00:24:59.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And then at what point... Obviously, I think time... Is there a difference? And I'm sure there is. I'm sure it's not that difficult, but because I don't remember. A difference in setting up an Evergreen campaign versus a time-bound one because of a certain promotion or something.

[00:25:18.170] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So with that, then you want to be thoughtful about your timing and your scheduling within the ads manager. We most of the time will stick with daily budgets so that we can adjust the budget on the day to day, and then we can see what's working, what's not, and where we need to reallocate budgets. But you can also do a lifetime budget if it's a shorter time frame, then that's when I would do a lifetime budget. But as far as setting it up in the ads manager in the ad set level is where you will set the schedule. And that's where you'll say turn on at this point, turn off at this point.

[00:25:54.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
How long does it take typically for ads to be approved? Because Facebook does have to approve them. I know people have had ads rejected. How does that take? Especially if you are time-limited, how early do you need to get that in?

[00:26:08.500] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So we always try and get ads set up at least 48 hours before they're scheduled to run or before we want them to be running. So if we're doing a specific time frame promotion, then we like to have at least 48 hours so that we can push it off. We submit the ads, and then Facebook. Sometimes, I mean, it's within or a few hours before we say Facebook is as the yay or nay, but it can take longer than that. If it's taking longer than 24 hours and you don't know it's still in review, it'll say in review for that ad, then I would see if you can make a slight edit to your ad or your ad set so that it'll reactivate the publish button because it'll see that you've made a change, and then you can resubmit it. Many times that will kick it through that sometimes it just got stuck. Other times if that doesn't work, then I go to chat support, and it's only during business hours, but you can go to Facebook chat support and have somebody from Facebook take a look and figure out why.

[00:27:16.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, because I know we both have a background in being in the personal finance niche, and they're real strict about what you can and can't say and do.

[00:27:26.910] - Monica Louie
And add.

[00:27:28.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Or Facebook is. So it's just don't... It could be your niche, it could be just got stuck. But make sure you plan ahead for that. Okay, so would you mind sharing your screen and giving us a little orientation into the Facebook Ads Manager back inside of things.

[00:27:49.410] - Monica Louie
Sure. Okay, so I'm going to show you my ad account. Let me see. Can you see it? Yes. Okay, so this is my account. And so here we have a few different versions of the ads manager, so you can see that I can click on this and try the new version. So that's the old version. I did a live workshop a couple of months ago, and we had three different versions of the ads manager. So just know when you watch this or if you watch this a couple of months from now, then things might look different. But basically the setup is we've got the campaigns, the adsets, and the ads. And then we've got our time frame over here. This is my ad account with the ad account ID, and this tells me when it was last updated. So I know how recent this information is, and this is based on this time frame. So these are the main things, and then this is the menu button. And so this is where you can go to all tools. You have a lot of different options. But most of the time we're sticking with the ads manager, which is what I just showed you.

[00:28:53.840] - Monica Louie
Or I can open up the audience's screen and we can take a look at that. Or once in a while, we'll go into page posts to look at the ads that we have running. Those are the main things. If you want to find your pixel information, that's under events manager, which there used to be a specific pixel section. So just know they move things around. So data sources is going to be the pixels. This is my pixel activity. And then if I click on this, I can see my pixel, and I have to go under set up and then install pixel to find my code. So I do manually add pixel, and that's my pixel code. And you don't have to understand it again. You just need to copy and paste it. So there's that. And then for the audience's screen, so this is what it looks like today. Again, it's always changing. And so you can create audience, and then you see you have those different options. So custom audience is the warm audiences, lookalike audience, and then saved audience is where you can actually mix and match. So you can pull in custom audiences or lookalike audiences in here.

[00:30:03.210] - Monica Louie
So you can see customer lookalike. But then you can also in the detailed targeting section, this is where you can search for demographics, interests, or behaviors. So if I say I want to create an audience of bloggers, then I can search for blog bloggers. You can see all the different options. It'll start to give you some things that might be relevant. Let's say, let me just do blogger and see. Now I've got more things. So let's say I did interest in blog and then suggestions. So then you can see that it'll try and help you create an audience. It'll give you some potentially relevant options. But of course, depending on what you're doing, not everything is going to be relevant. You might find some things here that sound like they might be relevant. They might be names of brands or Facebook pages, but you want to do your research and not just select. You want to make sure that it's actually relevant. But I really like using this. So I'll start with my keyword and then hit suggestions and see what Facebook suggests. Then you can do browse, which then to me, it's a little bit overwhelming because you have these different options, but then you have all these different sub-message questions, so that's where I like to type and then do suggestions for me.

[00:31:21.680] - Monica Louie
Then for creating custom audience, I'll show you we have a lot of different options there, too. You can use your sources. Website, so website. This again is if you have your pixel installed. If you have an app, then you can do app activity if it's connected to your customer list. This is where you upload your email list or your customer list if you have a list of people who bought your course or your ebook, for example. Offline activity we don't really use in the online blogging world. Videos, you can create an audience of people who viewed your video, Instagram business profile, so that's the engaged with Instagram audience, events, Facebook page, instant experience, that's if you're doing those types of ads, and then lead form if you're doing those types of ads. So lots of different options. And then again, all of these we can create lookalike audiences from.

[00:32:09.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. One other question, because I just remember, because you can choose where you want your ads displayed because there are actually several different places Facebook will place them, and you may not want them there. Absolutely. Are there certain places you recommend you don't recommend?

[00:32:26.840] - Monica Louie
Let me show you. I'll show you where you have that option. I'm going to pretend like I'm going to create a traffic campaign to walk you through that. I hit the Create button. Okay, so I do this a lot, so I'm going to start over. Okay, so I always like to start over even if I think I'm picking up, but just so I know I'm starting from scratch. So this is where you choose your goal. So what's your marketing objective? And again, Facebook likes to give us a lot of the different options. If we're driving traffic to a blog post, then we're going to use traffic. We want to have people join our email list or purchase a product, then we'll use conversions. And then you have a couple of these other ones that sometimes we use, but these two are the most often objectives that we use. So then traffic, and then again, we have more options. So you can set your daily budget. Always be mindful of your budget because Facebook will try and help you select your budget. So campaign budget optimization is putting the budget on the campaign level, which is what they seem to be moving more toward, as opposed to putting the budget on the ad set level.

[00:33:37.700] - Monica Louie
So here I would name my campaign. I wouldn't just leave it to default. I would say what I'm offering. So if I'm running it to my seven ways to lower your Facebook ad cost today, blog post, then that's what I would put here. I might say blog post. I like to be very specific. For this example, though, then here we have the ad set level, and this is our navigation menu. So if you want to go back and forth to any specific section, then you can jump around. But here is where you put all the settings. So this is where you tell the audience. And if you want to do detailed targeting, you can do that. And then here's the placement. So that's what you were talking about. So Facebook will say recommended automatic placements, but I, nine times out of 10, I will use edit placements. And the reason I like to do that, and you'll see again, lots of different options and they keep adding more and more. And that's because there's a lot of competition. A lot of people are doing Facebook ads. A lot of businesses are doing Facebook ads, and there's just a lot of competition for people to get their ads published and seen.

[00:34:38.500] - Monica Louie
And so Facebook is constantly brainstorming new ways, new places where we can put our ads. So you can check or uncheck by platform. So I will usually, if I'm going to do an ad for Facebook specifically, then I will uncheck Instagram because Instagram is a different platform. We know that the ad is going to appear differently. So, for example, on Facebook, we know we've got the headline and the news feed link description, and we've got the copy above the image. Whereas on Instagram, we don't have a headline. We just have the image or video and then the copy below it. So that's why I like to make the ad specific to each platform. But this is where you can check or uncheck. We can do Facebook stories now, Messenger stories, Instagram stories. And again, for those, I like to make the ads specific.

[00:35:28.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To.

[00:35:28.810] - Monica Louie
Those places.

[00:35:30.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do you ever do Messenger ads?

[00:35:34.710] - Monica Louie
So we have two different things when we say Messenger ads. We have the Messenger placement, which is where the ad will appear in the Messenger app, or we have Messenger ads where the call to action is for people to click to send you a message. And so, yes, we've done both of those. And as far as testing placements, I do like to start off, especially with a new campaign, to test most of them, the ones that make sense. So there are obviously some that are just for videos. If I'm not running a video ad, then it's not going to make sense because we are often surprised that even if we think like, Oh, this might not get a lot of engagement in Messenger or in the audience network, then sometimes we are surprised. So I like to at least starting out, give Facebook as many options as possible.

[00:36:27.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You can always go back and change it later.

[00:36:29.160] - Monica Louie
Yeah, you can always go back and change it. You can always drill down into the data to see where people are converting, and then you can use that for your next test. So a lot of times for traffic campaigns, we will find that the Facebook news feed or... Oh, Facebook news feed, and it used to be separated out here between mobile and desktop, we'll find that that's the best performing location in most cases for traffic campaigns. We just find that they get the best click-throughs. But again, every audience, every offer is a little bit different, so we do like to test it.

[00:37:05.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, that's good.

[00:37:06.680] - Monica Louie
Cool. Yeah, makes sense. Do you want me to keep going through here?

[00:37:10.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, if you want to just finish walking them through that, I think walking us through that, that would be great.

[00:37:15.440] - Monica Louie
Okay, cool. So then we have our optimization for ad delivery. And here for a traffic campaign, I would do landing page views because I've got my pixels installed. And so with the pixel, then Facebook can see the when people go from the ad and then end up loading the landing page. So it's just like a micro step further than just a link click. A link click means they clicked on the ad, the link in the ad, but a landing page view means they actually loaded the page, so they're more likely to actually digest my content. And if you do want to schedule your ads, then this is where you can set the start and end date. And then I obviously didn't put in my audience here, but you'll see this potential reach will change based on your settings here. Okay. So then we hit continue, and you can see we're moving along through this menu. This is where we will create our ad. So you want to make sure that you got your Facebook page selected here. If you're running an Instagram ad, then make sure you've got your Instagram account connected here. And then you have a lot of different options again here to create the ad.

[00:38:22.890] - Monica Louie
If you already have, let's say you shared your blog post on your Facebook page and it's already going on Gangbusters, it's getting a lot of engagement, people are clicking through, and you just want to pull that in and test it with more audiences, then you can use an existing post here, and then you can find your Facebook post there. But most of the time we're going to be creating an ad from scratch. And for a traffic ad, this is where I would use a single, it says, image or video, but I would stick with an image ad for traffic. And then this is where you can add your images. You can either upload an image or if it's in your Facebook library. It's something you've already posted on your page, you'll find it in there. And then this is where you put the text above the headline, and then the description is that little tiny text below the headline that most of the time will get cut off. And then you put your URL here, so you want it to be specific to your page that you're driving traffic to. Then if you want a call to action button here, you have the option here.

[00:39:25.040] - Monica Louie
For a traffic campaign, we tested this again, and we find that no button tends to work better because for the traffic campaign, we obviously want it to stand out so people engage with it and click through. But we also don't want it to look overly promotionally. So we tend to use no button for that. And then I like to make sure my Facebook pixel is connected here. I know that's my pixel ID and that that's turned on. And then it's just saying I have an error because I haven't filled in all the fields. But then once I'm ready, I would hit confirm, and then it would submit it to review.

[00:40:01.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, awesome. Yeah, I know. I think that's really helpful to see, especially because, I mean, it definitely looked different the last time I was in there. So appreciate you sharing this.

[00:40:10.810] - Monica Louie
Yeah, no problem.

[00:40:12.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do you have any final words and advice before we tell everyone about your... I know I've got a great free resource for everyone, but any final words and advice first?

[00:40:22.940] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So you hit it on the head a little bit earlier when you said patience. So patience and commitment is really what leads to the most amount of success when it comes to Facebook ads. So when I look at my students and my clients that have the most success with Facebook ads, just like we talked about, a lot of times we don't hit it out of the park. There's always testing involved. So just know if you're going to test Facebook ads, they need to be committed to the process because it will take time. Your first campaign might just flop, and you might feel like you wasted your money, but you're really learning something if you get back into it and look at the data and assess what worked, what didn't, what was the audiences? Did I test different audiences? Did I test different versions of my ads? And the more that you do Facebook ads, the more you'll learn over time. What is working? What is resonating? And of course, the longer your campaign runs, then the more the algorithm will help you as well. So patience and commitment to the process. I mean, just with any strategy in our business, if we're jumping around from strategy to strategy-.

[00:41:28.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Blogging is a long game. Pretty much every aspect of it is too.

[00:41:33.160] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So commitment. Yes.

[00:41:36.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. So I know you do have a great free offer or resource for our attendees. Can you tell us about it, please?

[00:41:41.820] - Monica Louie
Yes. So I would love to offer my free Facebook ad starter kit to your audience. And it's a guide, but it's more than just a guide. I wanted to make it a super helpful resource to help anybody get started with Facebook ads, or if they're feeling like, I'm running ads, but I want to make sure that I'm doing it the right way so that I can get the best possible result, this guide will help you. So it takes you through the six steps to create campaigns that convert. So starting with the pixel on through the strategy and a lot of what we talked about today. But then I also broke it down. And so you have a checklist at the end so that you can fill in. So I like to be fully prepared when I dive into the ads manager. So I like to brainstorm what is my offer? What is my goal? What's my objective? What are the audiences that I'm going to test? How am I going to exactly brainstorm my creative? So you can plan out all of that through the checklist. And if any of these terms that I've shared today are a little bit like, okay, not sure what she's talking about there.

[00:42:43.060] - Monica Louie
I've got a glossary to go through the key terms so that you understand the terms that are being used in the ad manager and also the terms throughout the guide. And so people can find that at Monicalouie.Com/bbsummit for a blogger breakthrough summit.

[00:42:58.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, and the link for that will be below as well. So you guys can just click there and it'll also be over there. Awesome. Thank you so much. This is really helpful. I think everyone watching will now have some confidence to give this a go and just give it a go, right? You can set a small budget if you're really that worried about it. As you dive more into blogging, you're going to find you could even set up Easy Yes Offers, as Kate Doster, who's in the summit calls them that can help pay for your ads. There's lots of things, but this, I think, was a great way to just get everyone their toes wet and understand how to get this going. So thank you so much.

[00:43:36.730] - Monica Louie
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. This is a lot of fun.

[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited to welcome back this speaker. She is a Facebook and Instagram Ads expert and Agency Owner who helps ambitious online entrepreneurs increase their impact with high converting ads. Along with her premium agency, flourishing impact, she helps six, seven, and eight-figure online business owner skyrocket their revenue, manages millions of dollars of ad spend and teaches thousands to successfully run their own ads. I'm super excited to welcome back, Monica Louie. Monica, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:39.480] - Monica Louie
Hey, thank you so much for having me. I'm honored to be asked to come back.

[00:00:43.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, and I'm always excited to I like to talk about ads because it's something that I've always dabbled it in the past, but I've never really successfully done. I've never kept doing, which is probably why it's never been successfully done for me. But it is such a great way to How to keep things going. So at what point, at what point should people start looking at ads, doing ads for themselves?

[00:01:08.820] - Monica Louie
Sure. Yeah. So there are a lot of things that we can accomplish with ads. It's main purpose is for driving traffic. And so that could mean to grow your email list, to offer your free lead magnet. It can mean to drive traffic to your paid offers. Or for us bloggers, it can just mean that we're driving traffic to get more eyes on our latest blog So whatever your goals are, you can find a way potentially to use ads to help get more eyes on your offers and your content. So when it comes to deciding if you're ready to run ads, it really is a matter of, do you have a small marketing budget that you can use consistently toward running ads? And so if you do and you have the bandwidth to dive in and learn how to create the ads, then I would recommend, if it aligns with your goals, to do any of those things that I mentioned, that you can explore it and see if it makes sense to do right now.

[00:02:04.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So eventually, I mean, ideally, ads shouldn't just be costing you money. They should be producing a result. Ideally, a result that pays for the ads. But obviously, it's not instantaneous. How long should it take to start seeing a potential profit from ads? Whether that's through your audience growth, I mean, it depends on your goal, I guess. But you can give us some examples of depending on how long it might take.

[00:02:32.280] - Monica Louie
Absolutely. Yeah. And so when it comes to ads, I mean, I have clients that come to me that we work with who their main goal is just brand awareness. They want to be the go to name. They're not necessarily, maybe through their business model, they don't have their own product to sell. But their goal with running ads is that they just want more brand awareness. They want their audience to think of them when it comes time to need their resource. So it could be anywhere from brand awareness all the way through getting that ROI, which that's where most of us think of, and that's a beautiful thing when we got that running. So if that is your goal, and for many people, that's the end goal when it comes to running ads, then we want to think through, Okay, am I ready to run ads? Will this actually give me an ROI? Do I have a funnel or a path to profit that converts. And then if you do and it's successful for you with your organic audience, then that means it's a good time to test running it with ads to both your warm audiences, also opening up to a larger cold audience that you can reach through the power of ads.

[00:03:35.410] - Monica Louie
So as far as how long it can take, it really depends on the conversion rate of your funnel that you have in place. And to see, we like to dive in when we're looking at, does it make sense for us to work with a potential client? What are the conversion rates of their funnel? What are the conversion rates of their landing pages, their sales pages? Looking at how many leads did they bring in through their funnel last month? And then how many sales did they make from that? And then does the math make sense with what we think where we can get their cost per lead ad and where we might be able to, over time, improve that conversion rate by dialing in on that ideal audience? So we like to look at the math and see it doesn't make sense. Do we think that our costs are low enough as far as the cost per lead and driving traffic into the funnel where it'll make sense to get that ROI and there's that ROI potential? So I would suggest that people look at those numbers, really understand what your numbers are, how many people join your email list last month, how many people ended up converting to your paid offer.

[00:04:40.410] - Monica Louie
If you have one core offer, how many sales did you make last month? Then Just seeing as a baseline what that conversion rate is, and then seeing if you can scale that up. It's always a good idea, though, for ads to be growing your email list. That's one of the evergreen strategies that I always think is a good idea for business owners to have going on in the background. You can do a low ad spend, just keep it going, bringing new people into your email list, into your world. You have the chance to build a relationship with them so that next time you have your big launch or your special sale or something, then you're growing that audience on a consistent basis and they're ready to buy.

[00:05:18.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that. So a couple of... I want to touch on a few things you mentioned. So you talked about as you zero in on your ideal audience. I will say when I've tried to... When I've set up ads in the past, that's been the biggest struggle is figuring out the audience for the ad. So do you have any tips on that and then tips on from where you start and how you hone in?

[00:05:39.940] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So thinking through the goal of the campaign and what the offer is. So if we have a flash sale where we have a limited time promotion, it's 20 % off our core offer, and we just want to make sure that our warm audience sees this. We're emailing and we're posting on social, but we also want to put some money behind getting those ads and that offer in front of our warm audience, then that's where I would say, let's just solely focus on the warm audience for that case. If it's like an evergreen strategy where we've got the evergreen funnel where we want to grow our email list and our audience at the same time as me getting that ROI and having sales come out at the end of the funnel. Then I like to test warm audiences and cold audiences together. The warm audiences will likely convert sooner, especially depending on the price point of the product. But the cold audiences can really open you up, and you can bring in a much lower cost per lead, usually, since the cold audiences are going to be here in the US, potentially millions of people that could be your ideal audience.

[00:06:49.790] - Monica Louie
And when it comes to testing the cold audiences, there are three total different types of audiences that we can target. So we have the warm audiences, which are the people that are already familiar with us. When you got the pixel placed on your website, then it's the website visitors. You can target your email list if it makes sense to your strategy. But then also your followers and people who engage with you on Facebook and Instagram, you can create audiences around those. So that would be the warm audience. For the cold audience, then we have the detail targeting option, which is where we can say, Here's some keywords and some interests that our audience is likely interested in. There's a bunch of different demographics and different things that you can drill down in when creating that audience. So definitely look and see what might be relevant to your core or audience. But then also my favorite type of audience is the lookalike audience. And that's where we can take any of our warm audiences. So let's say we've got a list of customers. So long as you have 100 people on that list and you say, Facebook, these are my ideal customers, and I want to find more people like them, then we can upload that list into the Ads Manager, into the Audience screen, and it'll match those profiles.

[00:08:03.660] - Monica Louie
And then we can say, Okay, find me more people like that. And that's called a lookalike audience. And so lookalike audiences, time and time again, are some of our best performing audiences. So when it comes to testing cold audiences, we like to test multiple different types of the lookalike audiences, and then also a couple of the detail targeting audiences where we're drilling down into those specific interests and demographics.

[00:08:25.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that. Then a couple more things. You mentioned, hopefully, you get it going, you have low ad spend in the background. What do you consider low ad spend? I feel like that could mean different amounts to different people.

[00:08:38.680] - Monica Louie
Yes. Yeah, no, that's a great question. So when just starting out with ads, and through my program, I teach getting started with ads at five or $10 per day per ad audience combination. So you have the multiple different audiences that you can test. And then there are many different ad formats and different types of ads that you can test as well. So for Each ad-audience combination, depending on your goal, I like to start those at five or $10 per day. So if your goal is to drive traffic to your blog post, you can get a lot of results, meaning clicks through to the landing page for very low amounts of money. So that's where I would say $5 is all you need per ad there. If your goal is to grow your email list or drive traffic to your paid product, then I like to have $10 per ad audience combination for those strategies. And that just means that you're going to give the algorithm and the ads manager enough money, enough budget to work with so that it's pushing out the ads and then starting to see those results come in so that it has information that it's getting through that feedback loop of seeing people actually opt in for your freebie or go and click and pay for your product.

[00:09:53.300] - Monica Louie
It gets that feedback loop. So then it's able over time to focus your ads, pushing them out to people who are more likely to either opt in, if that's the goal of the campaign, or purchase your product, if that's the goal of your campaign. So over time, you'll likely see your cost per lead or your cost per purchase decrease as the algorithm gets that data feedback loop.

[00:10:14.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So other thing off of that. So you're talking about opting in on your site and stuff. But I know Facebook has where you can actually do the opt-ins on Facebook, like an ad, so they don't have to leave Facebook. Do you like testing versus this website? Is that something that has worked really well that you've seen? What's your thoughts on that versus driving traffic to a specific place?

[00:10:39.820] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So typically we do like to control the experience of driving traffic to a landing page. And so we'll give our clients feedback on the setup of the landing page. We don't want any distractions on it. We want it to be really simple and straightforward for the freebie. If it's a sales page, obviously, we need more detail there. But for the freebie, if it's a free opt-in, we like to put the details in the ad itself so they know the benefits of the freebie, and then it's just a quick no-brainer, click, opt in on the landing page after they enter their name and email address. So that's typically what we recommend for the lead form that you're talking about. That can be a great, quick, easy way to get your lead ad going. And you can create really quickly and easily the lead form where it can capture the information. It'll autofill with their name and email and whatever information that Facebook has. It'll autofill. And what I've heard is that sometimes those are not as high a quality leads from the lead form as they are when they click and then have to type in their email address on your landing page.

[00:11:45.620] - Monica Louie
Just because it may not be the best email address for them to be reached at for the long term, that might just be their throw away all my spam email goes to that one thing that I use for my logins or whatever. Or they set up Facebook 15 years ago Exactly.

[00:11:59.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And that email address is definitely the case for me if it were. Absolutely.

[00:12:06.550] - Monica Louie
I've heard differing thoughts on this, but generally, I think the cost per lead could be lower for using the lead form. It could be quicker and easier to get that going than having to set up your own landing page. I'll always say it's worth the test. It may work great for you and for your offer and for your audience. It's always worth a test, but I would definitely see if you can notice and pay attention to the activity. Once they do opt in and fill out the lead form, then are they engaging? Are they opening your emails? Are they engaging with your emails at this similar rate to everybody else on your email list? Then you'll know If that's the case, then they're a good quality lead, and you can be happy with that potentially lower lead cost.

[00:12:51.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I want to talk more about testing in a second, but I vaguely recall the last time you were in the summit, you mentioning in terms of how many times someone should see an ad. That's a metric in the ad management and what that should be. And has that gone up? Because it seems like people need to see things like, it used to be seven times, and now it's like 30. So is there a certain point where it's like, well, they've seen it this many times and they still haven't clicked it, turn it off? Or what does that look like these days?

[00:13:25.490] - Monica Louie
Yeah. So that measurement, that metric is called frequency. So it's frequency rate. So when you hit go on your campaigns, you push your ads out, they start spending money, it'll start at one. So that means that the people who've seen the ad have likely seen it one time. Just know it starts at one. It's not going to start below that. So if it's already at one 5 a few days later, 1.3, don't think that it's out of the ordinary. But generally, you're right. So it depends, again, on the offer. So if it's a freebie, most people are like, yes, I want it or no, I don't. And so then it's a matter of audience size. So if you're just showing your freebie to your warm audience, and your warm audience is maybe 10,000 people based on your website visitors, then your frequency rate is going to climb much quicker. And again, also depending on your budget. If you've got a higher budget, then it's going to push the ads out more. Then you may see that you'll start to get the message from Facebook saying, creative fatigue, that people are seeing this ad, they're just not engaging like they used to.

[00:14:24.840] - Monica Louie
So it might be time for you to change it up. But if you're targeting those cold with potentially millions of people, then it's going to take a lot longer for that frequency rate to increase. It will also, again, depend on your budget. If you're doing a higher budget, you'll see it increase probably at a faster rate. But when it comes to going to the sale, when we are running campaigns for launches for our clients, and it's like, We've got five days, and we want everybody to know about the sale or the extra bonuses and all the things, then we'll set that frequency rate in those campaigns for three times a day just because they're We all know as we're scrolling on social media, there might be times where we're just scrolling and not really paying attention. We may have seen the ad. It may have been fed to us, but we didn't really pay attention with it. Then maybe it's like you see it and you're like, Okay, good to know. Then you see it again and you're like, That's interesting. Then you think about it and you're like, Okay, the sales going away. Let me actually see what's going on and make a decision.

[00:15:24.140] - Monica Louie
So yeah, it can take several times. So that's our rule of thumb is three times each day. It doesn't mean that everybody in the audience is going to see it three times per day, but that's the limit that we're saying because we don't want to overwhelm people and really annoy them that they're seeing these ads because I know I've seen, you can tell when people are doing big budgets because you just keep seeing the ads over and over. We don't really want to annoy people, but we also want to meet them where they're at and give them the opportunity to take advantage of the offer when the special offer is happening.

[00:15:53.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like that. I think that's definitely higher than what you said before because that was years ago. Okay, so talking about testing, because you mentioned it a few different times, we talked about testing lead forms on Facebook versus a landing page. How many rounds of testing do you typically see before you land on something that really works well?

[00:16:16.440] - Monica Louie
Yeah, so I love testing. I may have an inclination about, I think this will likely work better than this, but we don't know until we test. So it's always good to test. So I love testing every aspect of it. We'll take a look at the metrics of the landing page if we're promoting a freebie. What is the conversion rate of the landing page? Then we may work with our clients to change it up a little bit if we're seeing that the conversion rate is lower than we'd like it to be, and that could be affecting the cost per lead from our ads. As far as what we test with the ads and the campaigns, we'll test different audiences and then different ads, different versions of the ads, different ad copy, headlines, a graphic versus a video versus a carousel ad, different ad formats. What we'll see is when we start a new campaign, we have in our head where we think, based on working with the client and similar offers, where our cost per lead or cost per purchase should be, what our ROAS, a return on ad spend that we're shooting for. And if we come in lower than that after the first round of testing, then we're like, Okay, well, what are the best performers of this?

[00:17:25.570] - Monica Louie
So we'll test multiple audiences, multiple ads, and then we'll narrow it down. We give a good seven days. And after seven days of running, that gives the algorithm time to adjust and see who's engaging and see who's converting. Then we'll oftentimes have clear winners. So these ads are definitely outperforming these other ones. So We'll turn those off. Or maybe this audience is definitely our best performing audience. The other two, maybe not so much. So we'll pull back on the budget on those audiences a bit, maybe start to increase the budget on the better performer. And then we'll say, Okay, so with those adjustments, should we give a little bit longer or should we test new ads? And so that's where we go, and we just keep iterating for those evergreen campaigns. We will get to a point, though, if we're seeing like, Oh, my gosh, this lead cost or this ROAs is just incredible. We're like, Don't touch it, let it go, and then we'll just continue to slowly scale. And we like to do it slowly by increasing the budget when that happens because we don't want to throw the algorithm off.

[00:18:28.020] - Monica Louie
If we're getting 10 sales per day and we don't want to double the budget because then in order to have that same return, we need to have 20 sales for Facebook to help us find. We want to do it incrementally. Then as far as Evergreen, when we're continuing to test, we'll just consider the time of year. Sometimes we'll have an ad that will be performing great for a few months, and then just peters out a little bit. It's just not performing as great. We'll leave it In the Ads Manager, we have that data we can tap into to say, Well, that was a good performing ad, but maybe at the turn of the year or this next season, we might want to test it again because it did work great for a while, but then we'll test things in between and maybe bring it back and see if it comes to life again in the future.

[00:19:17.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like the seasonality of just everything else, so keeping that in mind. Any final things you want to tell people when it comes to getting started with ads and making them part of your business?

[00:19:32.930] - Monica Louie
Yeah. I think that when it comes to diving into the ads world, it is something that I know can be scary for people, can be intimidating. I know when I first started running ads for myself, I was hoping and praying that it was going to work, that I wasn't just letting my money on fire. And so I would say just start off small. If you're new to ads, start off small, start off with a budget that you can maintain and really focus on actually learning the platform, learning what you can do with ads, what the potential is there. And then I would just say start with one goal. Maybe your goal is to grow your email list. You just want to start there. You know that even if you're testing things and it doesn't work out as well as you want or it's more expensive than you think it should be, but you know that you're growing your email list, so you're getting a good return in that respect, no matter what happens, start with a budget that you can feel good about and not feel stressed about, and then go from there, and then continue to test and devote time to it.

[00:20:32.510] - Monica Louie
It's not set and forget it. But what I do love about ads, as opposed to an organic content strategy with social media, is that you don't have to be on pushing out new things every single day. You can set up your test, let it run, check in on it, and then decide next week, Okay, I'm going to test this thing. And maybe just test one thing at a time rather than testing four different things. Then you won't really know what actually moved the needle if your results are much better, the following week. So I would just say, take your time, but also don't give up too easily. So some people will get frustrated. They're like, okay, I'm all in on ads. And then a couple of weeks, then they're like, it's not working. And they just give up. So start slow, start small, and just go from there. But keep at it, because if you're focused on your goal, you can make it work.

[00:21:24.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, fantastic. And I know you have something for everyone watching. You want to tell us about

[00:21:30.060] - Monica Louie
Yes. So my free Facebook Ad Starter Kit, it's absolutely free, and it walks you through the six simple steps, many of which we've talked about today for planning your ad campaign. And so it starts with what is the goal and what is the strategy? What are the audiences? What is my ad going to look like? And it helps you walk through all of that so that you're ready to go in the Ads Manager. There's also a checklist. I'm a checklist girl. And so I've got a checklist there where you know, worksheet you can fill out where you're mapping all this out so that you're planning ahead of time before you go into the Ads Manager. Then you have it all ready to go, and then you go in and set it up. It also, if there's some of the terms that I've mentioned, you're like, I think I know what that is, but I'm not quite sure. I've got a glossary of key terms since Facebook ads and Instagram ads, the same platform, have language of their own. So I think it's a really helpful resource. I've gotten a lot of great feedback about it, but I think it's a great tool to help get you started with ads.

[00:22:30.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's fantastic. I mean, and clearly I didn't know the language. I was like that thing where they see it and you're like, frequency. So I think that'll be super helpful for people, especially like me. Okay, and I know you also have something for those that decide to upgrade. Can you tell us about that?

[00:22:45.660] - Monica Louie
Yes. Yeah, it's our flourishing ads guide. And so this walks you through the details of putting together a high converting ad. So it has the best tips from my great copywriter of how to write Ad Copy that converts for your different offers, how to draft those headlines, what element should be in the Ad Copy as you're thinking about putting it together. And then also my amazing graphic designer put together tips for how to create those amazing graphics that will catch the attention and help people stop the scroll and click through to see your great offers. And then we've got a lot of different ad examples for different things, different types of offers, lead magnets and paid products, both for or high converting ads. So you can see from my client what have worked well and actually got an amazing result. So lots of examples. If you're looking for some inspiration, you can find it in the Ads Guide.

[00:23:40.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. So definitely go check out that freebie she has for you guys to get started. That's definitely link below on the page. And if that getting started ad guide sounds like that, Hey, I want that, too, then make sure you upgrade. Monica, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and coming back. I know I learned a lot and sure everyone else watching did, too.

[00:24:00.010] - Monica Louie
Right. Thank you so much.

[00:00:00.060] - Zach Spuckler
Hello, hello, incredible bloggers. Welcome to this presentation on how to run Facebook Ads for list growth without having to worry about all those pesky changes with iOS 14, 15, and even the Facebook Ads Pixel. I am super excited for this presentation because if you're watching it, there's a good chance you're trying to get more people on your email list. You're trying to get people to give you their name and email so that you can market your products and services. And this is something that I've been doing with Facebook Ads for years. I love it. I think it's one of the most effective ways to grow your list. And real quick, if you're wondering who the heck is this guy, hello, my name is Zach Spuckler. You can find me on Instagram over @zackspuckler. I'm an agency owner. We do Facebook and Instagram Ads for online creators. I've managed over three and a half million dollars in ad spend. I've created multiple digital courses that we've taken to the six-figure mark. And on a less serious note, I have a dog, Charles Barkley, two cats, Shasda and Luki. We're welcoming a third kitchen into our little clan very soon here.

[00:01:14.450] - Zach
I'm Disney and RuPaul-obsessed like Disney tattoos -- RuPaul all up in my office. Like can't get enough of them, especially Trixie Mattel. If you are a RuPaul person, you know, you know. I have over a dozen tattoos. And I love digital marketing; and I love to put that one in there because I think sometimes in the online marketing space, we think like, oh, people teach this stuff because it's easy. I teach this stuff because it's fun. Like I, I can talk about Facebook Ads all day, right. I love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. And so I'm really excited to hopefully bring some of that passion and excitement that I have for advertising to you. So real quick, let's talk about the flow, right. And when I say the flow, what I'm talking about is like, how does this actually work? How do we actually leverage Facebook Ads to grow our business, right? Because we're going to talk about growing your email list, but the big conversation is that when somebody clicks on your Facebook Ad, you want them to also go into an email sequence, right? And I'm going to talk to you about how to write a compelling ad and where to get those ads started.

[00:02:15.130] - Zach
But I want -- I want to just make sure we mention that, you know, when somebody joins your list, you want to put them through an email sequence. And that sequence should tell them who you are, what you have for sale, how they can work with you, and important information that they need to make a buying decision with you from your blog business, right. So, what we do is we always start with a freebie. Okay. So you probably may potentially maybe not, that's okay, have this on your website already where people can give you their name and email for a freebie. Right? And we like to start with a freebie. This is the one that we're currently running in our business. It's a 2024 planner, and it's basically how to plan your course or blogging business for the next year, right, very timely, very relevant. Well, here's the thing. This freebie works wonders. We get people joining our list every single day from it, and it's because it's simple. We're giving our audience what they want, right. Especially in November, December, people are thinking about planning. They're thinking about what's next. They're thinking about their next steps, right. So it's simple. If you're like, what should I give my audience in exchange for a name and email

[00:03:16.650] - Zach
it's simple. Ask them what they want and make sure it meets this criteria. Number one, is it relevant? Okay. The biggest mistake I see people make with freebies is they create a freebie that's not relevant to their business but specifically to their products, right. So this is like a real big over exaggeration, but I'm talking about growing your business, right? So if my freebie was, let's say, grow your business using Instagram or create a really viral Instagram Reel, well, that's great. It speaks to my audience. But my offers are all around Facebook Ads so it's not relevant, right? The second thing is you want it to be digestible. It doesn't need to be massive. It doesn't need to be huge. You don't need to have a million things go into your freebie. People need to be able to get through it. Because in order for people to use your freebie, they have to be able to, you know, get through your freebie. So, you also want it to be desirable, and that's kind of what we talked about. It's like, is it something people actually want? I see a lot of people do freebies that are like, my top three tips, or my seven steps for that, and it's like 

[00:04:13.390] - Zach
that feels very Googleable. That feels very bloggable. But it doesn't seem like something I want to give my name and email for. So, make sure it's something people want. And finally, this is a huge one for me, make sure it's valuable. Okay. Make sure that what you're giving people is actually valuable. Okay. My planner, it's 15 pages long, but you could actually plan your quarters and years out with it. Like we've actually created something of value. So don't just throw something together because, remember, this is people's first impression of you. You want them to get a good impression, right? So make sure it's valuable. Now, if you're listening to this and you're already going, oh, my gosh, Zach. I feel really overwhelmed. You've, you've said so many things already. It's only been five minutes. And I don't know what to give away for free to start growing my list. Well, let me give you my favorite hack. I go to Creative Market and I just type in freebie template Canva, and it will kick out all of these workbooks, e-books, checklists, PDFs that you can use for your business in Canva and give away for free, right. Now you have to edit them, tweak them, put your content in there, but it's really easy to just get started, right.

[00:05:23.870] - Zach
So, if you're like I've done freebies, or maybe you fallen prey to like that three tips or five steps and you're like I need something more robust, this is a great way to get it. Okay. So we have to have that conversation so that we have this conversation, and this conversation is lead generation ads to grow your email list. So we are running ads to grow our email list 24/7. Okay. There's pretty much not a day that goes by in our business, and there's always exceptions, but I would say 95 % of the time we're running an ad that directly grows our email list. Okay. What we run is what's called a lead ad. Okay. And a lot of people are like, oh, I want to send people to my website, my Mailchimp, my ConvertKit, my ActiveCampaign, my, you know, Squarespace, my WordPress, where people go to my website fill out their name and email and then they get my freebie, right. What we recommend in our business and for our clients is what's called a lead ad or an on-Facebook experience. Okay. So you've traditionally seen the ads where you click on it and it takes you over to a website. A lead ad or a lead form ad, as they're sometimes called, is where people click on your ad,

[00:06:34.870] - Zach
we all know what the ads look like we spend a lot of time on Facebook and Instagram so we know what the ads look like, but then we send them over to a form that exists on Facebook. Okay. This is our secret weapon, and we love it for a variety of reasons. Three big ones, though, number one, it does not require the Facebook Pixel. So people always ask us, how do I use the pixel? What do I do with the Pixel? How do I install the Pixel? And we say, If you're just at the point where you're trying to grow your list, don't worry about the pixel yet, right. If you know how it works, great. This is just going to enhance that. Second thing is it tracks with near 100 % accuracy because everything is happening on Facebook. So when someone goes to your website, if they have iOS 14 or they have tracking disabled, it may not report even if they had clicked on a Facebook Ad back to you that they signed up for your email list, and that makes tracking the data very hard. Okay. The third reason I love them is they're very easy to set up, and they're cheaper, right.

[00:07:35.370] - Zach
We typically find that lead ads are 20 to 40 percent cheaper than standard ads where you send people over to your website to give you their name and email, right. These tend to work a little bit better. Okay. Now, one thing worth noting is that because everything happens on Facebook, you need a piece of software to move it over to your email service provider, your ESP, right, so that could be Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Flodesk, right. The place that you go to send emails to your full list, you need what we call a bridge software that moves the leads from Facebook over to there. Okay. If you don't, Facebook will simply keep the information on Facebook, and that doesn't give you the ability to email them. So, in terms of what you actually need like from a brass tax perspective to run these ads, you'll need an email service provider. I recommend ConvertKit. I think it's really great, very much catered towards creators. And a software I recommend called Save My Leads will take the leads from Facebook and put them into ConvertKit. Okay. Now, one thing I want to say is there's unlimited alternatives to both, really, right. So you don't have to use ConvertKit.

[00:08:48.240] - Zach
You can use Flodesk, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Keap, you know, it doesn't matter. A couple of other ones, if you're like Save My Leads is my favorite because it's the easiest to set up as a bridge software. But if you don't have Save My Leads, you can also use Zapier. And Zapier pretty much integrates with pretty much everything I've seen so far. But if you still are having issues, you can also check out integrately.io as another alternative. Okay. So again, if you're kind of like hitting that point which a lot of my newer clients hit where they say, this is great but I'll just send them to my website because I don't want to hassle with that. Well, here's the thing. With lead ads, you get a lower CPM, right, and CPM stands for cost per thousand impressions. And basically it's cheaper. It costs less money to run an ad where they stay on Facebook because Facebook likes when you keep people on Facebook. So they charge you less to run these ads. We also typically see a higher conversion rate, right. So typically, more people who see these ads and click on them sign up. We get as high as 70, 80 percent conversion.

[00:09:55.190] - Zach
So typically, when you send someone to your website, 30 to 40 percent of them will convert to your freebie best-case scenario. Best-case scenario with lead ads, we see like 70 percent to 80 percent, right. So almost twice as many people actually click and fill out the form. If it costs less to run them and more people who click sign up, you end up with a lower cost per lead, right. So, you ultimately end up paying less money for this lead that's going to still potentially convert to a sale. So I just want to show you lead ads in the Ads Manager. When you go to set up your ads, you're going to see you go into the Ads Manager and you click to create a new campaign. You're going to see that one of your options is leads, right, and that's what we're looking to do. We're looking for leads. Names and emails are leads, right. And in your next step, you're going to see that you can choose website or instant forms along with a number of other options. But website is where you're driving people to your own page, right. Instant form is what we're talking about today, right.

[00:10:59.730] - Zach
So, I want to talk, you know, these are the ads that I want you to run, right. Run ads for lead forms. People fill out their name and email on Facebook. It sends it to your CRM, where they then get that email sequence that we talked about, right. So now we need to talk about the images and the copy, right. How do you actually make an ad that you can put in the Ads Manager that works well? Well, first, there are four primary image types that we work with, with our clients and our members and our membership. And these are mockup, stock photos, lifestyle photos, and text photos. Okay. So a mockup, at least for us, has always done the best, right. If you have something that you can represent visually, especially on Facebook and Instagram, people are very visual, right. They're on a platform where they're looking at content. So, if you can visually represent in a mockup format what you're promoting, these typically do very, very well for us. Okay. For us, we get one to two-dollar leads of the planner. This is one that we did in 2022. We do our planner every single year because it always works great.

[00:12:07.110] - Zach
But you can see it's super simple. It's just a mockup of the freebie. Okay. The second type that we run is a text ad, and that's where we're focusing on text. Now, if you've run Facebook ads in the past, maybe like three or four years ago, there used to be this rule with Facebook that you can't have more than 20 percent of your image be taken up by text, but that's gone. That doesn't exist anymore. So, you can take up a ton of space on your image, asking a question that grabs their attention -- asking a question that gets them to pay attention. Right, so we have a text ad. The next ad that we have is a lifestyle ad. Okay. A lifestyle ad is where we get someone's attention by showing them our lifestyle, right. So if you're a lifestyle blogger, a fashion blogger, maybe even a food blogger like a picture of you in your kitchen would be great, right. So this is something that showcases like our lifestyle. And to be clear, these don't have to be -- these don't have to be like high-quality branded photos. They don't need to be done by a professional photographer. Some of my best lifestyle photos from ads, I've just taken a selfie at my desk.

[00:13:10.780] - Zach
I've had my partner, my friends, family members take a picture of me out in the wild -- out in the wild, you know, just interacting with my, my environment, right, and those can work really great. And finally is stock photos. We have a couple clients where stock photos do really stinking well. Okay. So don't be fooled by the simplicity of an image. It just has to help your client kind of see who they are reflected back at them, right. So don't stress about like, oh, I don't know if I should do a lifestyle or a mockup or a text or a stock. Pick two or three mock them up like create them in Canva and see how they work. Okay. So images, I think, are shockingly or deceptively simple, I should say, because you don't need to do anything crazy fancy. You don't need special design software. You can do it in Canva. You don't need a $1,000 camera. It's just create an image that makes your audience stop and go, oh, what is that? Right. So, the mockup makes them go, what is that? The lifestyle makes them say, that's someone in the kitchen. I want to cook, right. It's something that helps them kind of like see the potential or, or of who they want to be or who you are or invokes curiosity, right.

[00:14:25.180] - Zach
And with that, you need to couple it with copy. So copy is just literally the text that goes with your image. And this is my simple tutorial. This is the framework that I teach to everyone who goes through my ads boot camp hook, question, authority, content, call to action, close. Okay. So real quick, what we do is we start with a hook. Okay. And a hook is something that grabs people's attention and helps them kind of say like, oh, what is that? Right. So if I was a food blogger that's teaching people how to meal prep a week's worth of meals in under three hours, I might say, does meal prepping take you eight hours on the weekends and cost you your time, sanity, and that quality time with your kids? Right, it grabs their attention. It may also interweave or be a question, but the second step is always a question that helps them self-identify. So, for example, if you are teaching people how to manage their budget, your question might be like, does your budget feel out of control? Right, because that helps them go, yes, that's me. I feel that way. I connect with that statement -- me, me, me,

[00:15:33.950] - Zach
I, I, I, right. You want your audience to be able to read your copy and kind of be nodding their head along up and down like, yes, that's me, right. So a hook grabs their attention. A question helps them say, yes, that's me. And then authority is, why should I trust you? Hey, I'm Carmen, and I paid off $100,000 of credit card debt in three years, and I want to show you my step-by-step process to pay off debt, right. It grabs their attention, tells them that they're in the right place, and then says here's why you should trust me. The content is quite simply, what is the freebie,right, a workbook, a planner, a cheat sheet, a downloadable, a template, you know. What are they actually getting? And then the call to action is click to download the workbook, right. Sounds silly. Don't forget the call to action. We've tested this, and there's been a lot of tests done that say when you tell people click the link, they will click the link at a higher rate than if you just don't, right. So guide people on what you want them to do. And then finally, your close is just your sign-off, right. So close by saying, you know, hope to see you crushing your debt, you know, Carvin, right.

[00:16:42.530] - Zach
You don't have to do that. The close is optional. But my brand is very personal, very interconnected. A lot of blogger brands are very personal. So typically we add a close to our ads that make it feel like a personal sign-off, right. So once you've -- like let's just take a step back, we're going to jump into your welcome email, but I just want to do a quick recap on what we covered. Okay. We talked about your freebie. You create a really solid freebie. You set up your lead ad using the image and copy framework that we just went through. And then what's going to happen is people are going to give you their name and email and you're going to send a welcome email. And this is the most important email that you send. Why? Because here's the thing you have just interrupted somebody with your Facebook Ad. Okay. I call Facebook Ad jokingly interruption marketing. People aren't on Facebook, if we just follow with that same example, looking to fix their debt. They're looking for escapism. They're looking to get away from reality. They're looking to connect with their friends and family really. Maybe they're on there in their Facebook groups, you know, that might be about debt, but for the most part 80 to 90 percent of the time we're on there to just escape reality.

[00:17:50.910] - Zach
So if you have grabbed their attention with good copy and an image that connects with them, and they have given you their name and email they're seeking to fix a problem now, right. This is a great chance to move them into the world, into your world, because they've actively said even though I'm in a position where I don't want to be bothered you can bother me. You have their permission. You have their buy-in, and so this is a key email in your sequence. And here's what I do in my first email. So, take a note of this. Screenshot this. Write it down. But in my first email out to all my new leads, I give them the freebie. I remind them why they should trust me by establishing my authority again. I share my content flow. So as bloggers, you are probably blogging on a tri-weekly, bi-weekly, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly basis. You're putting out new content. When you put out new content, I recommend that you email your list, right. So tell them that you're going to be emailing them. I drop a new blog post every Thursday all around conquering debt. I'll be sure to send that to you.

[00:18:59.410] - Zach
 Set the expectation on your regular email content. Then invite them to your social media, whether that be Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. Say, if you're not already following me over there click the link below. I recommend one. Choose your most important, most frequent and most engaged social media platform where you want to spend most of your time and send them there. Then if you have an offer, you can put it in here. So you don't have to like --you're not pitching it. You're not selling it. I really don't recommend anything over $50 to $100 to start. But if you've got a basic offer, you can share about it, right. So like let's say you got the debt pay-off master class and it's $67, right, you could put that in here that's like, hey, if you're looking to pay off your debt, I do have this awesome masterclass. Feel free to check it out. Click here. It's like a one to two sentence blurb just a peak curiosity, right. We're not selling at this point. We're just telling them who we are, what we have to offer. Then wrap up the email. So great to connect with you. Can't wait to see you paying off your debt.

[00:20:03.820] - Zach
And then sign off, you know, X. X. Carmen or X. O. X. O. Carmen or sincerely Carmen or, you know, let's be debt-free together, Carmen, right, whatever -- however you want to sign off your emails. So again, to recap, this is such an important email because you have like -- you have their attention. So first and foremost, give them what they came for your freebie. If they have to search for it in the email, they'll leave. Most people are going to read this email, so establish authority similar to how we did in the ad. Tell them how to stay connected to your content and when to expect emails from you. Give them a call to action to join you on your top social media platform. Tell them what your offer is and give them a call to action to join you on a waitlist or check it out now. Waitlist is going to be better if you have a high ticket offer. So like I mentioned earlier, I prefer to be under $100 for this particular call out. But if you've got a high ticket offer that you launch a couple of times a year, you can also do a waitlist. Remind them you're excited. Tell them you'll email more soon and then sign off, right.

[00:21:01.770] - Zach
Have a fun or professional sign off, whatever makes most sense for your audience, right. So when I do a new email sequence, I take the lead ads and I sequence them. So a sequence is simply a set of emails that got automatically after someone joins my email list, right. So, what I do is I'm setting it up so that people who are on my email list are getting a set of emails or who just joined my email list are getting a set of emails. So what I do is quite simply I make an offer every other email, right. Every other email I'm making an offer. So I'm saying email number one is my freebie introduction email. Email number two is like a piece of content maybe one of my best blogs or my best resources that I've ever made that's free. I'm going to give it to them for free just to build that goodwill. And then email three, I'm going to make an offer. Come join my waitlist. Come buy my product. Come get my thing, right. I'm going to make them an offer, right. Now, I recommend that you start with ConvertKit to run your email sequence. It's affordable. It has automation.

[00:22:08.420] - Zach
But again, absolutely anything can do this. But this is my core fundamental email flow. Okay. And I know you might be thinking, Zach, this class that was about ads and you talked a little bit about copy and creative and running them. But here's the thing. I don't want you out in the world running Facebook Ads to grow your email list without this in place, right. Yes, we talked copy. Yes, we talked creative. I even showed you that little screenshot of the Ads Manager about the options to choose. But if you start running ads to grow your list and this doesn't exist, you won't make money. You'll be spending money to grow a list, right. So people like to say, the money is in your list -- the money is in your list. But the reality is the potential money is in your list. If you put this in place, you can actually generate leads, sales, waitlisters, and profits from your new leads. So immediately we send out the opt-in, right, the freebie. Then I do a value bridge, and this is where I basically say, hey, thank you so much for grabbing my freebie. I hope you're enjoying it.

[00:23:07.590] - Zach
By the way, I've got this great piece of content that you want to check out. That piece of content will typically, for me, be a blog or a podcast where I'm also presenting a product within the blog or podcast. It's not a blog or a podcast about a product. It just includes a product which the next day I will pitch that product. Again, if it's a higher ticket product, I'm pitching the waitlist. Then the next email, I share some of my top tips. For me, I always have a blog or a podcast about my top tips around something, and then again, four days later is my final automated call to action where I'm saying, hey, don't forget to get on the waitlist. Don't forget to buy my product, right. Now, after this, you're still going to email them weekly. Okay. You're still going to email them weekly and you're still going to send them all your content. But start here. Okay. So just to run through these, you've got your freebie email, your welcoming email which we talked about, but the value bridge connects a new subscriber to a highly valuable piece of content, okay, blog, podcast.

[00:24:06.970] - Zach
The goal is to cement your authority, but also itch their scratch, right. What are they struggling with? What is the freebie about? If it's about debt, don't send them a blog post about credit cards, right. Third email pitches your waitlist, right, your sales offer or your waitlist. Okay. This can be stories, testimonials, calls to action, but give them a good reason to join. Okay. Give them a reason to buy your product or join your waitlist. Top tip email, very similar to the value bridge email this is an email about giving them a top tip that goes deeper on in your offer, right. So don't just choose, again, like I'm very intentional about my emails, don't just choose a random tip. Give them a tip that relates to the product you sell, right. And then finally is your final call to action. So if they haven't bought a product or they haven't gotten on your waitlist, make a case for why they should, right. It doesn't need fake scarcity. It doesn't mean need a special countdown timer or this is your last chance ever. It's just a solid pitch that says, hey, I just wanted to remind you one last time to grab this thing.

[00:25:17.090] - Zach
I'll be talking about it more in June, December, whatever, but grab it now if you want, right. So again, deliver that freebie. Bridge them to a piece of value. Make an offer. Talk about your top tip related to your offer and make that offer again, right. So what's next? If you're watching this and you're like, what do I do now, Zach? So create your ads.
