Krista Miller [00:00:12]:
Hey there. Welcome to the training on how to fill your funnel with leads at launcher course through a high converting virtual summit. This is gonna be a lot of fun, and we're just gonna dive right on in here. And don't worry. You're not gonna have to sit through, like, a 15 minute long or really dramatic story of my life, but I do wanna use this one slide to just tell you a little bit about why I'm so passionate about this topic. And I actually started out hating virtual summits because of just how slimy and gross they were, and I very distinctly remember complaining about them in a mastermind I was in back in 2016, when one of the members had guessed that they were gonna become a big deal that year, and they did, but my views on them obviously changed, and I came up with my own slime free system in 2017. And since then, I posted summits ranging from small 500 attendee events to producing larger 14,000 attendee events, a single event of my own has brought in up to a $121,000 in sales, just from the summit itself, not including a launch, and I've honestly learned so much both from the successes and the failures and every event I host is a chance for me to learn more and pass it along, but everything I've learned so far has has led me to my signature summit hosting framework. And then once I had that baseline framework down after the first few events, I experimented with launching, a course through a summit in 2020 and hit my biggest launch ever at the time, And that success led me to walking through the same process with clients to see if it would work and translate for them, and it did.

Krista Miller [00:01:42]:
We've brought in more record breaking results, and I've created our signature summit to course launch system to teach you how to do the same thing, and it's the reason we're here today, of course. So if you're here, I would guess that you have an incredible course that sells, but you need more people to sell it to, which is such a common problem. Right? It's funny we go through so much work to create our courses, and we think that's the hard part, but then we get the thing created and we're like, dang. Now I gotta, like, consistently find people who want to buy this. So, before we get into the 4 key steps that we're gonna talk about, I wanna just kinda set the stage a little bit to help you become aware of what you might be doing right now versus where we want to get you through a summit, so it all kinda makes more sense. So right now, you're struggling or at least hustling to generate enough leads for your course to hit the goals you set. You're spending too much time, bringing in leads with too little return on that investment with these slow growth strategies that just aren't cutting it and not cutting it consistently at least. And I know how frustrating that is.

Krista Miller [00:02:40]:
Your calendar is full of things that you know should be making a difference, at least according to what other people say. Right? But it it's just not cutting it. Things like creating content, engaging on social media, doing podcast tours, and those things that we know are worthwhile in the long run. I'm not saying those things don't work. I'm saying that you might get to the point where you're like, I need something that works right now. You might be at a point where you're seeing diminishing returns on your current launch or list building strategies, like maybe Facebook ads, and you're ready to try something new and more effective, and I poked up Facebook ads there, but I know there's so many different launch strategies out there, email sequences, webinars, challenges, and those things are great. I do all of those things myself, but sometimes you just find that you need to kick it up a notch because you wanna sell more of your course without constantly piling on more strategies in order to in order to scale, because that's not how it's supposed to work. We're not supposed to have to work way harder each time we want to increase our goals.

Krista Miller [00:03:38]:
So if you're someone who's tried most of these things from content marketing to challenges to networking and all other things listed there, but you find that nothing is generating the leads you need to hit your launch goals consistently, just know that you're not alone in that, okay, plus once you get those leads in the door, you're still not done. After that, you're you're doing additional things like challenges, webinars, video series, and email launches to convert those leads in into sales. And you do get sales each time, which is wonderful, but you're ready for bigger, better, more momentum filled launches and consistent evergreen sales as well. And this ties back, you know, just to the fact that a lot of the strategies that you might actually be using as, like, ways that you're trying to build an audience are actually designed as launch mechanisms. Okay. So if you're going out and you're hosting webinars, and part of your goal with that is to build an audience, that's just how it works. Okay. You need something much more effective, and this is where the power of a summit comes in.

Krista Miller [00:04:41]:
If you wanna combine all of those strategies with one thing that can do it all at once, a summit is what you're looking for and you are in the right place with this presentation. So let's dive in. You know, of course, I'll be talking about the 4 keys that you fill your funnel with leads and launch through a summit, but we're also gonna touch on things like how to have summit attendees, like, begging for you to open the cart to your course, which, you know, that never gets old. Right? We'll talk about the number one thing that can make or break your summit results, and then we will cover the biggest mistakes summit host make that lead to, 0 or very few course sales. So now that you have some context, you know, you kind of have an idea of why I care about this so much. Let's go ahead and dive into these 4 keys. So first up, the first key is, of course, the summit. The high converting summit you'll host is what kicks off the entire process and it's what draws those leads in to fill your funnel with.

Krista Miller [00:05:32]:
So typically this is gonna be a 3 to 5 day engaging online event with a group of speaker presentations, based around a specific topic that your audience wants. And if your goal is to go in and launch your offer through the summit, I would lean more on a shorter, shorter time frame. When I say the 3 to 5 day range there, I'd I'd go towards the the shorter end of that. So why is this part, this first key so important? Obviously, you can't host a summit without a summit, but I want you to see the power of a summit done the right way. It connects you with speakers who become affiliates and help drive traffic to your event. Because of that, the size of your audience doesn't matter because your speakers are helping you bring that audience. From there, you'll nurture the audience through your summit with engagement based strategies, which established that established the know, like, trust factor way faster than other lead generation methods you're used to using and at the same time, you're able to build desire for your offer while creating a transformation for attendees that they're excited to continue with once the event is over and that is powerful. And I know I I just said a lot of words right but in case you didn't notice I wanna give you a visual too your summit is a full funnel that's what I just went over from lead generation to launch built into one event and condensed into a small, very high impact time frame.

Krista Miller [00:06:50]:
And we have a full episode all about how a summit is a full funnel on the summit host hangout podcast, so be sure to check that out if you haven't. But in this process, you're connecting with speakers who drive a cold audience, getting those people on your list, building trust by getting them engaged, helping them make progress to the Summit, also reengaging your existing audience, you're introducing all these people to your offer, getting the first purchase out of the way with the all access pass, and then making your offer, all at once, all in one strategy. So we know what's so much powerful, but there's also one thing I wanna warn you about because I see this all the time in my Facebook group, and the biggest mistake I see is people that, well, let's just go to the slide. The big mistake I see is trying to reverse engineer someone else's summit and see the results you want. So you might be here at this summit being like, how are they doing this? But people I see will say things like, I'm so inspired by everyone in this group. You know, maybe they take part in a couple summits, maybe even, some of our client summits, but number 1, there's so much you don't see from the outside looking in that goes into a summit. So many pieces, so many emails, so much strategy, so many decisions, so many little tasks that you never think about, but more importantly, I want you to keep in mind that not all summits are set up to be profitable or lead into a successful course launch. In fact, most of them aren't.

Krista Miller [00:08:05]:
Okay? And I'm gonna take you through an example here. So this is what industry standard summit conversion rates look like typically some of our registration pages convert around 20 to 30%, so maybe 30% of people who see your summit registration page might sign up from there this is actually kind of an old stat I would say right now industry standard is, like, 2 to 3%. All access pass conversion rates because things have gone down a little bit recently. I think just because of of the rise in summits. So that means, like, 2 to 3% of people who sign up for your summit that's run the typical way, 2 to 3 percent of those people might choose to upgrade to your all access pass, and then most, hosts miss the opportunity to launch on the back end of the event, or they don't do it well because no one else is teaching it like we do here at Summit In A Box and in our launch with the summit Accelerator Programme, but let's just do an example here to kinda give you some numbers and some context with that. So assuming that 4,000 people see your summit's registration page between you, your speakers, maybe you run some ads if you want to, you get 4,000 people to that page. These are the results you'd see based on that taking percentages kind of in the middle of their example ranges I gave, so, and we're also gonna figure in a $100 average all access pass sale price for easy math that might be a little bit higher than what some people, and up with with the average price, but I just wanna give you something really easy to visualize here. The numbers are not the point.

Krista Miller [00:09:26]:
The comparison I'm gonna show you in a minute is the point. Okay. So just give me a second for that. So with those 4,000 people seeing the summit registration page, we'd expect about 1,000 of those people to register for the Summit, which would lead to about $3,000 in all access pass sales. You're not gonna hear me complain about a 1,000 leads, I'll take that, but I am not willing to put in months of work for $3,000 in sales. So I will be the 1st to tell you that summits are just straight up not worth it to run with the way they're typically done. With with the way people look at other people's events, maybe follow other strategies out there. I don't know how they're doing it.

Krista Miller [00:10:03]:
With these standard conversion rates, it's just not worth it. But let's compare it to what this standard conversion rate looks like using our framework. So this is what our client conversion rates typically look like. So summit conversion rates across across the board have gone down a little bit lately, and I've could adjust the conversion rates, we expect here to fit that. So if you were to go watch another one of my pre recorded trainings that haven't been updated yet, you might see that all access pass conversion rates and those examples are a little higher, but just know, that lately, I would say as of, like, q4 2022, things have gone down a little bit, so I am factoring that in here, I'm not inflating things. Anyways, we tend to see between 50 to 65% of people who view the summit registration page sign up. We've had clients get higher than that, but I always try to show reasonable numbers, and from there, we've been seeing an average of about 8 to 12% of attendees upgrade to the all access pass, just depending on the niche, the messaging, the time of year, sometimes the the website design. We'll see as low as 6% with our clients as high as 25%, but I would say 8 to 12% is the most common right now, and then from there, the conversion rate for the launch of your course will generally stay in line with past conversion rates you've seen.

Krista Miller [00:11:12]:
So a summit isn't magically gonna make a sales page or a webinar or an offer that doesn't convert work well, right? But it will warm up thousands of leads really quickly and get them excited to jump in, which is why we, I I specifically tend to talk to people who already have those proven offers and you have those stats stats and you know how things are gonna go. So the safest bet for your launch conversion rate for a summit is to compare it to your past launch results and your past conversion rate. So just like we did with the industry standard conversion rates, let's assume we got 4,000 people to your registration page, Again, going with conversion rates in the middle or lower end of these ranges, that would bring us to about 24 100 people registered for your summit. From there, you'd end up with about $24,000 in all access pass sales. And assuming a lower price course of about $200 with a 2% conversion rate, you'd add almost an additional $10k through a launch. And I know some of you are selling, like, I don't know, $50 a month membership, some of you are selling $2,000 premium courses, some are selling $10k group programs, so that last line can look way different, just based on what you're offering, but my point here is this comparison. Seeing these numbers side by side is so eye opening to me every single time, the way summits are typically done are not worth it to do. It's so important to host a high converting summit the right way, so you could actually see a payoff from the work you put in.

Krista Miller [00:12:33]:
So if you were to host someone that drives 4,000 page views, by the way, if you have, like 20 speakers that comes down to about 200 visitors per speaker, so it's doable, you can add a 1,000 leads to your list with the way summits are typically done or over 2 times that with our framework. You could, you could add $3,000 in revenue with the typical summit model or over 24,000 with our framework, and it's really so powerful. I've broken down examples in other trainings for everything from, premium courses, high ticket programs, low price memberships, but I hope these numbers are helping you see a little bit about why the high converting summit is our first key here and why I am so passionate about that part of it. So we're comparing what not so good conversion rates can do to your overall results compared to good ones, but what makes a summit have those high conversion rates? Right? Like, how how do we make sure we're on the the right side of that comparison? There are a lot of pieces at play, of course, but the biggest part is the way you position your event. So this includes positioning that both attracts the right audience to your summit and aligns really well with the course you want to launch afterwards. And this will make sure that we're not only filling your funnel with leads, but filling your funnel with the right leads, which is important. Right? So what goes into this positioning? First, you have the specific group of people your summit is for, this is, of course, quite important. I'll walk through the big mistake we we see with that here in a second.

Krista Miller [00:13:56]:
Then you have the tangible outcome your summit will create for those people, and third, it includes the messaging you use to communicate both of those first two pieces. So when you're positioning a spot on, you're someone that attracts the right people and makes them actually wanna sign up, which is a good start, so your number of registrations just skyrockets there. It leads speakers to actually be excited to participate in your event, so if you think about the past few pitches you might have received, so many, so much of our decision goes into how what we're being pitched is positioned. If we understand it, if we care about it, if we like the person, if it's for an audience we wanna be in front of, the right positioning makes writing copy so much easier and more effective and with the amount of copy that goes into a summit, this this is just a must. And it also builds desire for your course while helping attendees make progress through your summit, so they're primed and ready for that next step with you. The big mistake we see all the time here is just bad or kind of meaningless summit positioning, and you might think, no, I wouldn't do that, but almost every summit host we've ever worked with has needed help on this piece. I've seen some of the biggest business owners out there, people you would a 100% know the name of, get this wrong and then go on to say that some of us don't work because of it, when really it's because they missed one of the key pieces. So what does bad positioning look like? And, you know, I always feel a little weird here because I don't wanna, like, call out anyone who has used these things before, but here are a few examples that came to mind.

Krista Miller [00:15:19]:
Vague positioning looks like a summit to help online business owners grow their business, a summit to help entrepreneurs make more money, a summit to help burnt out moms be happier, a summit to help intuitive women find inner peace. Positioning like this is what will lead you to see those industry standard 20 to 30% conversion rates we were talking about earlier. But on the flip side, what are some examples of position that works well? So these are all client examples that really nailed this, so I submit to help crochet business owners increase profit while nurturing their love for crochet, I submit to help small churches reignite their children's ministry, I submit to help moms of toddlers learn techniques to regain control without yelling, a summit to help card makers find inspiration for and make their holiday cards. So do you see the difference? Like, how much more powerful and exciting are these examples on the right side? This, like, these are examples of things that are gonna catch people's attention. Someone will identify with all of those options on the right side, but not necessarily the options on the left. And here's a similar comparison for the topics. A summit to make more money versus reigniting a children's ministry. So like all of the options, on the right side are just so much more attention grabbing, and the results really spoke for themselves there.

Krista Miller [00:16:28]:
So I want you to start brainstorming your son positioning today. So first, consider who is the audience for your business as a whole, who are you targeting, or if you're gonna launch your course after the summit, who is that course for, who's the audience for that course? Next, this is a step almost everyone needs to take, okay, what subsets or smaller groups can you break that audience down into? So, for example, if my larger audience is someone with some kind of signature offer, I could break that down into course creators, membership site owners, people running high ticket programs, honestly, even those are very broad and somewhat unclear, but that gives you an example of how you can look at breaking down your audience into subsets. From there, look at which of those you're most drawn to, or which group have you gotten the best results with, or which one sounds the most fun to you. That group is your summit audience. Okay? And that doesn't mean, like, you're leaving everyone else out. It might means you do different editions of your summit so that they actually convert well instead of, you know, you turning into one of the people that says some of us don't work. So next, from there, consider what that specific targeted audience that you landed on, what that group of people needs help with that doesn't, like, apply to everyone on the Internet. Right? What's specific to them? So going back to my personal example, I run a summit called sell with the summit.

Krista Miller [00:17:47]:
The first version of that was, one for course creators. So it was course creator edition, and our mission was to teach people to combine the power of their course with the high converting summit to hit their launch goals, scale their course sales, all of that stuff. And then the person I originally created that summit with went on to host versions, for membership site owners, speakers, podcasters, and then I took it back over into course creator edition again. But like for example for the membership site edition her promise was to help membership site owners add their next 50 to 100 members with the summit. We were able to get so much more specific because we went and niched down the specific audiences and did different versions of the event. So, hopefully, you see here how, overall, like, even with our example, the thing we were helping with was increase sales. Right? But because we niched down, we were able to speak way more specifically, and I want you be able to do that too. So based on what those people need help with how can you make that more specific more actionable more positioned to like how you can help rather than necessarily focusing on like pain points And then how can you position it to build desire for your offer without replacing that offer? And when you put all those pieces together that is your summit topic.

Krista Miller [00:19:02]:
In this piece, I would say is both the most important and the hardest to get right. Okay? But it's so worth the effort and thought and time you put into it because even if absolutely everything else for the summit is done right, the positioning can be what causes this difference. You seeing conversion rates here on this slide, and if you're like, oh, I'm gonna need to walk through that again, I'm gonna talk about a free resource at the end where we have specific trainings on both the audience and the topic, and also talk talk more about tying it in to be positioned well for your course. So, I'll talk about that at the end. The 3rd key is your summit speakers, and these are speakers who will both bring an audience to your event and build an audience from participating. So everyone always wants to know how many speakers am I supposed to have. There's no set rule. Okay.

Krista Miller [00:19:44]:
A summit using our strategies can really have anywhere from 10 to 30 speakers. I would say the most common range is from 15 to 25 ish. The key here is that they need to be really strategically selected to bring and build that audience. They'll come into your event, deliver a value pack presentation, and good to go. Right? The presentation they can do can be live or prerecorded. I suggest prerecorded for a first time event. They can be, slide presentations or interviews. I tend to lean towards slides, and then, about 20 minutes long is typically the sweet spot to keep your attendees from getting bored and checking out, but don't stress over that piece too much, as, you know, you'll be able to see from the fact that my presentation is probably gonna end up longer than that.

Krista Miller [00:20:24]:
So the biggest mistake here I would say is inviting the wrong people

Krista Miller [00:20:31]:
to speak, and this tends to show up in the form of inviting the first people that come to mind and just

Krista Miller [00:20:31]:
kind of generally prioritizing the wrong wrong things in your speaker search, which leads to speakers who don't promote or promote without much success. So for example, pitching the big name influencer you have in mind, like that's cool, but are they gonna promote? Probably not. Pitching your business besties or the person you see speaking at every single summit. Those things really won't do a darn thing for, actually creating a successful event. So we have 8 steps to take, to brainstorm speakers and 7 pieces of criteria. We walk our clients through to decide if they're a good fit, but the first thing to look for is the audience match. So you want the speakers you pitch to have the same audience as you're targeting for your summit. Otherwise, they're not gonna be excited to promote something to something that doesn't make sense for their audience, or if they do promote, they're not gonna see results because they're promoting to the wrong people.

Krista Miller [00:21:19]:
So when I hosted my summit for brand and web designers, I was looking for speakers who marketed themselves to brand and web designers specifically and had proven offers for those people because I know if they can sell that offer to those people, like, they understand how to market to this audience and that's what I'm looking for. Both as far as promoting my summit goes and as far as speaking on my summit goes. So why does this matter so much? Without an audience match, your speakers aren't gonna be, as excited to be a part of your event. If they do agree, they'll do the bare minimum in order to get a little visibility, but they're just not gonna be in it. And the people you pitch are more likely to say no as well. It doesn't make sense for them to spend time on something that's not gonna bring the right audience in. Right? If they agree to speak, they're, like I said, less likely to promote, meaning those 4,000 page reviews from our example are way harder to get. And if they if they do promote, you're just not gonna see the results you're looking for.

Krista Miller [00:22:07]:
And when I figured this out, this was the difference you see there in the $22k summit and the $60k summit. The only change I made was figuring out, like, oh, the speakers who got the good results here all all targeted the same audience as my summit. Imagine that, let's try, you know, doubling down on that next time. Okay. That worked. Then I did it again the next time. Okay. That worked.

Krista Miller [00:22:27]:
So I learned this through trial and error, but luckily, you don't have to. And finally, key number 4 to filling your funnel with leads and launching with the summit is awareness, and that's awareness for your course that you're building in throughout your summit without being pitchy and gross, so give you a little quiz here, which launch is gonna have better results? Summit A, that's total pitch fest, summit B, where there's no mention of the course and it's just like sprung on them, or summit C, where attendees have slowly become aware of the course and the fact that it will be available as a summit has gone on, but they're not being pitched until they're ready for it, like, obviously, I'm setting you up there, the answer is c, but the big mistakes you wanna avoid here are either turning your summit into a pitch fest or blindsiding attendees and speakers with a pitch they weren't expecting. Neither one goes over well, and there's definitely a fine line to keep in mind, but awareness of it is is the first step, but, like, that's why strategically building that awareness in in a way that feels good to you, your attendees, and your speakers is so important. We want your attendees, like, begging you to open the cart by the time that you do, and we want your speakers, understanding and knowing that your cart is gonna open as well. We have an entire module going over all of this in our accelerator program, but to give you an example, like, one way you can build awareness really simply is to just include the name of your course whenever you introduce yourself in a video. Like, hey I'm Krista founder of summit in a box and creator of the launch with the summit accelerator program that helps you hit your next level launch goals with virtual summit like it's a you know it's a little bit wordier than if I just said hey I'm Krista but it gives them so much more understanding of who I am and I get to talk about my program every single time I'm in front of them without pitching them. Right? They're just, like, gently having the awareness built of it. It's so powerful.

Krista Miller [00:24:05]:
You know, there are more obvious things you actually wanna do with within your summit, but I just wanna give you an idea of different, like, low key ways you can build awareness. So I know this was both a lot and not a lot at the same time. Like, these will get you started. These are the things I want you to consider when you go into start brainstorming, what it's gonna look like to launch your course through a summit. So we talked about how to position your summit to attract attendees, speakers, and set you up for successful launch. You learned why not just any speaker should be a part of your lineup both for your sake and theirs, and you saw the importance of strategically building awareness for your offer through your summit. So I hope this has your wheels turning and that you see the power in the strategy. So if you're like, heck yes, I'm in I'm all in with this, I'd love to invite you to dive into our free sell with the summit training series.
