All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next session with Serena Appiah, who's going to be sharing How to grow a YouTube channel, and she's done it quite successfully. So Serena, welcome and thank you.

[00:00:10.920] - Serena Appiah
Thank you. This is exciting. I am so happy to be talking with you. Yeah.

[00:00:14.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I know it's awesome because you have this great channel, but you're also someone that's not necessarily blogging about blogging. So I feel like you've got a lot of knowledge to share. Can you give us just the highlights of what we'll be learning today?

[00:00:29.530] - Serena Appiah
Sure. Sure. So today we're going to be talking about YouTube, how to grow your channel on YouTube. And there are so many topics that we can cover. Unfortunately, we don't have two and a half hours because I could really talk to you about everything. But today we're going to cover things that would be applicable for someone who has started their channel but really hasn't gotten that momentum that they need. They're not sure if they're doing all the right things. So we're going to cover some YouTube best practices, and we're going to cover things like how do we even come up with content and ideas? Where to go? How do you know it's working? What's not working? And down to things like, okay, well, before you publish, what are all the things that you have to populate your YouTube with before you actually hit publish? And then once it goes live, what do you do? Is it working? Is it not working? And then that's a little bit more than just looking at how many views you have. You want to actually look at some of your analytics. So we'll go through a little bit of analytics as well as content creation and that whole process.

[00:01:33.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Well, I'm excited for this session because I took a stab at YouTube last year, and I put it on the back burner now, and I'm sure lack of consistency is my number one problem. But I'm excited to learn from you. Let's go ahead, and I'm going to let you lead the way, and I'll pop in the questions.

[00:01:49.340] - Serena Appiah
Sure. So I just want to talk a little bit about why video can be challenging for people to do. I think a lot of times people are afraid to really put themselves out there, and they're afraid of how they're going to look on camera. They're afraid of if people are going to judge them. And honestly, people in the YouTube comments, sometimes they can be mean. For the most part, I've had a lot of success, and I've moderated negative comments out, but it can be challenging putting yourself out there. And most people, when they decide to do it, they want to go full steam, right? They want to grow their channel and get big. But they also worry about the equipment. We're not going to talk so much about equipment because I think in this day and age, we've got amazing cell phones that take great footage. So I don't like to get held up on so much technology.

[00:02:37.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You don't need a professional camera that costs $700.

[00:02:41.340] - Serena Appiah
No, you don't. I mean, your audio is pretty important, so definitely keep that in mind. But video quality is astounding. So we're not really going to cover those things. So we're going to talk about what are the things that you need to do in order to put out good quality and how do you even come up with content ideas. So one of the things I like people to do is to actually dig into what you have done and then dig into what your competitors are doing. And there's a couple of tools that you can use to do this. First of all, just going into YouTube and finding who are the people who are talking about what you are talking about? So finding those people who are talking about, in my case, furniture makeovers, how are they conducting their videos? Are they doing these big productions? Are they doing furniture makeovers or projects in their backyard. I mean, I'm in my garage and I'm in my driveway. But there's other people doing that, too, and how is their channels growing? There's another thing I would have people do too. Now this is a paid service, but I believe you could split this with five friends.

[00:03:46.100] - Serena Appiah
There is a tool called Semrush, S-E-M-Rush, and it's for SEO, which is Search Engine Optimization. This is how you're able to find out if you have a blog, what are the keywords that are driving people to your site? And who are your competitors? It'll actually tell you in there who are your competitors. This tool is probably about a hundred dollars a month.

[00:04:07.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I think that's right.

[00:04:09.160] - Serena Appiah
Yeah. I don't want to spend that money. So what I do is I've got four friends and we all split it. So it comes out to 20 bucks a month. I think anybody can afford that for a great tool. So what I like to do is go into... Now this is in terms of coming up with content ideas for your YouTube channel. So what I like to do is go into SEMRush, and you can actually probably do this within Google Analytics to find out what your top content is, what is driving people to your blog, who are the competitors that SEMRush has identified? And then I like to do a little bit of digging. So I like to find out what those people are talking about. Do they even have channels? So if I've got five competitors and none of them are doing video, that puts me in a position to out-rank them to out-perform them because you want to be at the top fo the game.

[00:05:01.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And we have SEO sessions in the Summit. I'm pointing like you can see my schedule, but, that video does help in ranking because it helps people stay on the page longer. There's a lot of... It's complicated, but yeah, video does help in terms of ranking and out-ranking.

[00:05:22.210] - Serena Appiah
Video helps. And so what I tell people to do again, look at the competition, but then also look at your top content. So if you're digging into Google Analytics, look and see what is driving a lot of the traffic. Now go back to those posts and even on competitors' posts and find out do they have videos? Do you have videos in your top content? And what I had found with my YouTube channel, some of my top content, I didn't have videos for. So I would actually create videos for my top content that was already bringing in traffic. And so this was a way for me to create a video that would be embedded in that blog post. So that's given people, like you said, the opportunity to stay on the page longer. You already know that there's traffic coming to those pages, and now you're giving them an opportunity to realize that you have a YouTube channel and that you're able to get subscribers. You're getting people watching your content. So if you're not getting views, this is if you've already started a channel, if you're realizing that you're not getting views, but you have a blog, make sure that you're combining that top content with videos that you're producing so that the two can go hand in hand.

[00:06:33.700] - Serena Appiah
Because what I also like, too, is when people are searching for, for example, how to paint a dresser. Well, I've got a blog post on painting a dresser, but I realized I didn't have a specific video that goes in there. So now not only are you ranking, hopefully, for How to paint a dresser, but you're also showing up in the little thumbnail for the video icon, How to paint a dresser. So just keep those things in mind in terms of coming up with ideas. And again, seeing how your competitors rank and if they've got top content that doesn't have a video, why don't you create a video for that content and possibly be able to get some of that search traffic?

[00:07:14.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And just to interject, if you don't have SEM rush and that is a price of your tool. You can always just as like bootstrap until you get there. Go see what are your top posts? Go into an incognito window on your computer and search the keyword and see, okay, is any video popular enough? And if it is, is it any good? Because some of them are terrible. You could be like, I can create something way better. And so that's another way to... It's maybe a little more work because you're doing things individually. It's not all pulled in for you. Semrush is amazing. It can help you a lot in creating content too, in terms of what keywords to use because there's a lot. Anyway. 

[00:08:07.690] - Serena Appiah
I'm not affiliated with SEMrush at all. There's another site that I use too when I'm coming up with content ideas to even find out what questions people are asking. And I will make sure that I put all of these answers into this. It's called answerthepublic.Com. It's a site that you can use for free. I believe they give you five free searches per day, I believe. But if you do the pro version, you get multiple unlimited. But this is a way that I will say, Okay, well, what questions are people asking about this content before I even publish a video or a blog post? Because I want to make sure that I'm answering every question imaginable related to this topic. So let's say that you've done all your research, and this is also part of your keyword research too, right? So you want to make sure that you're looking in Google trends. Google trends is a free site that you can use to find out what people are talking about, when they're talking about it. You've done your research in SEMrush. So let's say you've created this amazing video. You have a professional camera or you have your iPhone, but it's an amazing video.

[00:09:09.950] - Serena Appiah
What do you do now that you are ready to publish? So here's what I like to tell people. When you are ready to publish a video on YouTube, there's some things that you have to do, right? Like your title has to be a title that's going to not be click-baby, but you also want you want it to be something that people are going to want to see, right? They're going to want to think, I'm interested in knowing more about that topic, and you want that keyword to be in your title. So, for example, if I'm talking about painting a dresser, I'm not just going to do a video that says painting tips. It's how to paint a dresser, so that if people are searching for that, hopefully that video will pop up. I'm also looking at things like my description. Now you'd be surprised how many people don't put enough attention into your description of your video. Now that keyword that you research, that you've checked out on Semrush or Google Analytics or Google trends, you want those keywords to be in your description. That's very important. I usually try to put probably try to use it twice, and I may try to use other keywords that are related to that.

[00:10:17.720] - Serena Appiah
So if I'm talking about painting a dresser, I might put painting furniture or other words that might be relatable to what the topic is. But there's other things, too, that you need to put in your description. You want to make sure that you've got all your social media links that are there. And what are the things that you want people to do after they watch your video or while they're watching your video? Do you want them to go back to your blog? Do you want them to sign up for your email list? What are those call to action? Call to action, yeah. Yes. What are those call to actions that you want people to do? And make sure that you put them there in your description. Now, YouTube actually has a way. If you go into... If you go into your Google, not Google Analytics, but if you go into the Analytics of YouTube, you can go into your settings and actually create a default template of your description. Yes. So this means every time you upload a video, you don't have to go back and copy and paste. It's already there for you. So if you have certain affiliate links that you want to include, if you want your subscribe link to be there, you can perfect it and then have it be that way all the time.

[00:11:30.090] - Serena Appiah
And then you just have to put a little blurb with your keywords. And in fact, I just did a content audit or YouTube audit with a brand who didn't know that they had this option. They didn't even know that their description is so important. And so I went back and pulled apart their description and told them all these tips. So make sure that you are utilizing that, because what I find is that people are more likely to click back when I give them a reason to. So, for example, I'll do a video on a furniture makeover, for example, and I'll say, Hey, to get the materials list, click here to go back to the blog. And surprisingly, people will leave YouTube and go back to your blog, right? That's where you can grab them in, get their email address, so that now they're on your email list and you can continue to send them video links and other content or affiliate links or sell them your product.

[00:12:19.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I just want to... I didn't know about that with your... So if you go to your channel, you're like, YouTube Studio and you go to settings and then upload defaults. And it's like, where in YouTube is this? Because that's amazing. So I was like, wait, what? So I'll let you get back to it. But I was like, this is where it's at for anyone. Yes.

[00:12:40.230] - Serena Appiah
And I'm glad that you mentioned that exactly where it's at, because even for myself, I had to dig in. It's something that I'd set up a long time ago, and I didn't even really think about where it was until just recently when I did the consultation for a brand. But that is where it is. And so every time you upload, it will have those defaults. Now, I also upload as unlisted. That's one of my defaults. So anytime I'm uploading, it will automatically be unlisted because I want to make sure that I've got my title as good as I can get it. I want to make sure that I've got my description as I want it. And I also want to change my thumbnail. And the thumbnails are super, super important. And I think sometimes when people are doing YouTube and they don't realize how important their thumbnail is, sometimes they'll let YouTube select their thumbnail because it'll usually give you three options... Let you to pick your option, like your thumbnail option. It should be a 1280 by 720 sized picture. And I'll actually just use canva. Canva.Com is a free site that you can use.

[00:13:45.570] - Serena Appiah
They've got templates in there already, but I already just have a blank one set at 1280 by 720. And then I'll take a picture that I specifically have taken for my video. Now, this is where I want people to actually think about your content and plan your content. Now, for me, when I'm doing a project, I will usually take a lot of... When I'm working on a DIY project, I will usually do a lot of landscape pictures or portrait pictures. But landscape is what you want for YouTube, right? Because it just looks nice in that 1280 by 720. Plan your content, because if there's a picture that you want high quality, high resolution picture and you definitely want to show some white space, right? So, for example, if I'm taking a picture of a furniture makeover, I'm going to do a nice landscape picture. That main focus, maybe it's a chair, a dresser, I'm actually going to just have it off to the side a little bit so that I've got some clear space for some wording. So keep that in... What's that?

[00:14:47.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Rule of thirds.

[00:14:48.840] - Serena Appiah
Yes, exactly. Rule of thirds making sure. And this is something that you plan because there have been times when I have been going back, ready to do the thumbnail, and I'm like, Oh, I don't have a good picture. And then you're scrambling trying to find that eye-catching picture. So make sure that it's something that's zoomed in. One thing that I've noticed is that when I post wide-angle pictures, the thumbnails never perform. The videos never perform well because people can't see anything. So if I'm doing a room makeover, I might want to zoom in on one part of the room and then have a big word that says before. Because people like mystery. So if there's a way that you could create some mystery in your thumbnail, it could be three secrets you didn't know about saving money. Or for me, again, it's that furniture makeover that just- Before and after. Before. Yeah. And I actually used to do this on my thumbnails. I used to give it to them right in the thumbnail. Here's the before, here's the after. Those videos would perform okay. But in YouTube, you can actually compare all of your videos to find out if certain thumbnails are performing better than others.

[00:15:58.310] - Serena Appiah
We'll talk about that in just a moment. But you can actually look and see how is this video performing with this thumbnail versus if I put another thumbnail. So just keep that in mind of planning that thumbnail as you're uploading, as you're even shooting your content. Another thing that you have to do is you have to do cards. Now, whenever you're watching YouTube, I'm sure we always see that little card, the little thing that pops up. And this is something that's pretty important when you're planning your content. You can talk about other videos related to the one that you're doing. So I can say, hey, today we're going to be stripping this chair. If you're not sure about stripping, be sure to click up here in the corner for more stripping tips and videos. Now, that can be a video that you're linking to, or it could be a link to your blog post, or it could be an opt-in. So if you're looking to grow your channel and grow your views, cards is an excellent way to get people clicking up there for related content. It keeps them on your channel. It keeps them watching.

[00:17:01.920] - Serena Appiah
And it tells YouTube, Hey, this person's interested in what they have to say. So they're going to serve up more content for your audience. Just make sure that you... I'm not sure how many cards I think you might even be able to do like four or five cards.

[00:17:17.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I think four is about right.

[00:17:19.470] - Serena Appiah
Yeah. You don't want to overwhelm them. I generally will do like two. And I'll try to... A lot of times I'll try to- I say.

[00:17:27.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm like, I'm pretty sure it's four. I maybe use cards because I was like, I don't know how to do this.

[00:17:33.840] - Serena Appiah
Well, they've actually made it pretty simple. And there's a tool that I'm going to tell you about in just a moment called TubeBuddy, T-U-B-EBuddy, TubeBuddy. And they actually make it really simple. You can create templates. So let's say that you're uploading three videos a month. You don't want to have to manually go in and do your cards. You can actually create templates with TubeBuddy so that you're able to just click, boom, I want this template applied to this video, and then it's there. And it's less work for you because then you can get your videos uploaded much more quickly. Another thing that you want to... Oh, and also, too, with a... To finish my thought on what I do for cards, I always try to lead them to something that's relevant, a video that's relevant to that video that I'm doing. But I also try to lead them back to my blog with my project gallery. And people are interested in seeing, Oh, I want to see more projects.

[00:18:33.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So- I like the style, she redoes stuff in.

[00:18:36.690] - Serena Appiah
Exactly. Exactly. Or like you said, even if there's a particular style, Hey, if you like dress or makeovers, I've got a whole bunch of them on my blog, click up here to get a link. So it's just another way to get people engaged in your content. Another thing you have to think about as you're uploading is your end screens. Now your end screens are those little videos that appear at the end of your video that can give people an opportunity to continue watching. So make sure that you're utilizing that because it is an opportunity to capture those people who they just love your content. They just watched an entire video. They're down to the last 10 seconds. And and they want more. So it gives them a place to go. It's a call to action. Check this out. And this is- I always.

[00:19:21.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Think of the late night show YouTube clips. Yes. Because they always have the host that does a, Hey, if you like this. That always is what I think of when I think of the end screen.

[00:19:33.290] - Serena Appiah
Right. Yeah. And that actually is a really great idea. They've got something that's their standard default and screen clip that they put, Hey, if you enjoy this, check out more of our videos. There's a friend of mine from his name is Eric from Garden Fork. I'm going to plug him because his videos are really great because he just has this engaging way when you're watching his videos. And he'll actually at the end of his videos, he'll say, and this isn't like a pre-video clip, he'll say, hey, and if you love this video where I'm talking about gardening in the spring, click over here, because there's another video that I did that you might really like on gardening in the winter. And so he will actually move the camera a little bit so that there's some space there created because he knows that's the video that he's going to promote. And I keep telling myself, I'm going to do that. I'm going to remember to do that. For me, when I get to the end of my video, I'm usually showing a before and after. I'm usually not even thinking that far ahead of, Hey.

[00:20:39.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
What else do I want to do? This is where planning the content can come- Yes.

[00:20:42.510] - Serena Appiah
This is all about planning your content.

[00:20:44.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It shows- And those are content you have. When you've been at it a while, it's easy to forget. You're like, I think I have a post on this somewhere, but then I have to go find it and figure out. Yes.

[00:20:53.540] - Serena Appiah
Yes. But I really like the way he does that because he's having a conversation with you, and it's not just something that's popping up. You're hearing him tell you, Hey, you might like this gardening in the winter video. So just think about that when you're planning your content. After they watch this, what else could they watch of yours that's relevant? And now that I'm talking about this, I'm going to do it for myself because it is powerful. So other things that you might want to think about is time of posting. I'll admit I generally don't have a scheduled time. I know there's a lot of people out there that will say, Okay, maybe you post at 11:00 A.M. On Wednesdays, or try different things and see what works for your audience. I'm usually not that organized because I may have a good intention of posting on Wednesday at 11:00, and then something comes up and I'm like, It's Thursday at midnight, and I will post it. Because I'm like, If people love me, they're going to see it. They're going to find it.

[00:21:52.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And there is... I just want to add because I didn't know this the first time I was doing some YouTube videos back in 2018. And so I was just publishing them and I was like, they all really go together. You can schedule them. Yes, you can. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. And so I was posting video one, which didn't really make as much sense. It needed the context around the post or whatever. And it was just published and I was like... And so in the description, I was like, the rest coming soon because I didn't know. But you can schedule them. If you managed to actually get ahead, which actually I think one of our sessions is how to batch videos and create a lot. Then you can schedule them out if you want us to stick to a schedule.

[00:22:37.560] - Serena Appiah
exactly. Yes, you can schedule. And you can look and see if maybe this video performs best if you post at night versus in the day. And I think it probably just depends on your audience. I mean, when are they most active on YouTube? For me, I feel like evening time is going to be best because for myself, I try to use myself as an example, I'm probably my target audience, someone like me. And I'm more likely to watch videos at night when I'm not at work because I'm trying to be productive during the day as I think most people probably are.

[00:23:12.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Going down to YouTube and rabbit hole before bed.

[00:23:15.800] - Serena Appiah
Yeah, exactly. Go to YouTube and check out the things that just popped up. So you can test it out. Now I will jump forward a little bit here, now that we're talking about this, so that you can actually test this. There's a feature on YouTube called groups, and I think it's available for everybody. This is really key. I've heard people talk about it a lot, and it really hasn't been up until the last couple of days that I really started to dig into this. So what you can do, if you go to your Google... I keep saying Google Analytics. If you go to your YouTube Analytics and YouTube Studio, Creator Studio, you'll generally see a dashboard, right? And there's underneath that main dashboard, there's a little blue link there that says, See more. So if you click, See more, it will then take you into more of your analytics. Right at the top right-hand corner, there's a little button that says, Compare. So if you actually click, Compare to... What's that? Yes, compare to. So if you click, Compare to, there is an option there that you can actually create a group. So let's say, for example, you want to compare the videos that you have posted in the morning time because you know that you've posted, let's say, these five videos in the morning versus these five videos that you posted at night.

[00:24:37.210] - Serena Appiah
You can actually compare how are they performing. And this is so key because now you can really break your videos down into any group that you want, whether it's posted in the morning versus posted in the evening. I can look at, in fact, I did this just yesterday or on Monday. I can look at videos that have thumbnails that have a little mystery behind them where it's just the furniture that says before versus the furniture makeovers that actually have the before and after and the thumbnail. Which one's performing better? Which one's getting more engagement? And it was, well, not really surprising, but when I saw that the videos for me that had just the before performed so much better in the browse, right? So browse is the videos that YouTube is serving up in subscription feeds. It's the videos that are going to that may land on the main little feed when you open up your YouTube app or you go to YouTube.Com. Those are browse suggested, are the videos that are coming up in the related video sections, right? So if someone's already watching a video on how to strip furniture and your video comes up on the side, that's suggested.

[00:25:49.950] - Serena Appiah
So you definitely want to have a lot.

[00:25:52.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Of- It tells you, yeah, and the traffic source. It's like YouTube channel pages- Exactly. -or YouTube features are out, suggested. I'm looking, I'm like I have a... Because I have then jumped into my YouTube in a while and I was like, hey, I need to make another video because this one's way outperforming everything else. I need.

[00:26:10.530] - Serena Appiah
To do.

[00:26:11.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A related video. Yeah, look at.

[00:26:14.260] - Serena Appiah
Your content that's performing well. And then also, too, you can compare how your videos in 2018 are performing to 2019 or 2019 to 2020. There's so many different ways that you can compare your videos. And I really wish that I'd discovered this sooner because it's very powerful. It tells you which of your videos are actually performing better based on these groups that you're creating. So definitely look into that. That will give you some ideas of what's engaging. Another thing that going back to things that you should do before you actually post the video, because that's more of what you should do after, like when you're comparing to. But going back to what you should do.

[00:26:55.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Before- Analyzing your data to-.

[00:26:56.670] - Serena Appiah
Analyzing your data, exactly. What you should do after or before also, and some people may not realize that you can actually pin your first comment, right? So this is the first comment. Before you even go live when your video is unpublished, unlisted, go into the comment section of your video and leave a comment there. So you might want to ask people, what tip did you like? Of the 10 tips that I gave you, what tip was your favorite? Or you can add a link. Maybe it's an affiliate link to a product that you've been talking about. You might want to ask them other questions. You might want to lead them to the Materials list. So my.

[00:27:36.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Question, what's the benefit of doing a comment versus the description?

[00:27:39.940] - Serena Appiah
Okay. So basically, you want to create as many opportunities as possible for people to do your call to action, right? So some people, they may never even go down to the comments, so they may not see it, right? Now this pin comment, let's say you've got a hundred comments on your video. Now, generally, YouTube, if you do not have a pin comment, so a pin comment is, let me tell you what that is first. Some people may not know. It's the very first comment that is seen in the comment section. And to pin that, again, I may put a link to an affiliate or whatever I want people to do. What do I want them to see? Now there's three little dots. When you're hovering over that comment, there's three little dots right there by your comment. If you click that, it'll say pin comment in one comment. And that means when someone's watching my video, they will be able to see that pin comment before anything, because generally what YouTube is going to do is they're going to serve up the most popular content, I mean, the most popular comments. So let's say you've got a hundred comments and one of them was something funny that someone said, or could even be something mean, I don't know, but generally something funny and it's got 30 hearts.

[00:28:57.820] - Serena Appiah
Well, YouTube thinks everybody wants to see that. So that's the first comment they're going to see, unless you have something pinned. If you have your own comment pinned, they're going to see your comment first. And it could be, Click here to buy this product. Go here to get the materials list. It's a way to get them to do what you want them to do. Or if you want engagement, because YouTube likes that engagement, right? So when you're posting, you want people to leave comments, because the more people who are interacting with that video, clicking your cards, your end screens, leaving a comment, answer a question that you asked in your video or in the first comment, YouTube is going to say, Wow, people like this. So let's go ahead and roll this out to more people. Let's make this a little bit more widely distributed. Otherwise, if no one's commenting, if you're not putting cards and end screens, it's just there and you might get 50, 100 views. But if you get people interacting on that video, YouTube is going to know, okay, people like this and they want to see more of this. Those are all the things that I think of and that I do when I'm doing my upload.

[00:30:07.970] - Serena Appiah
So then once I'm actually uploading, then what happens? Well, then I'm sharing it everywhere. I'm sharing it everywhere I could possibly share this. So I'm definitely going to send this out to my email list, right? To my email list. It was actually a little larger about a month ago, but I got rid of all of my unopened cold subscribers. And you probably have an email marketing summit video, which would be great for people. But I've got a list of probably about 15, 16,000 now after the cut. So I know that they're more engaged, right? So I will send a link to them saying, Hey, there's a new furniture makeover video. Here's the before picture. You want to see the after? Click on over. So they'll click over. And then I will post that teaser picture on Facebook, on Instagram, Twitter. My Twitter, I'm not very active, but I want as many people as possible to see that. Not only do I post it on my business Facebook, but I'll also post it on my personal Facebook, because there are people that are readers who are on my personal Facebook. So I still treat that as like business-personal.

[00:31:14.660] - Serena Appiah
In addition to my business. So what you want is you want an influx of views coming into your video, right? So if you're promoting this video in this way and people are watching, it's going to be boosted up. They're going to, due to the algorithm, they're going to enroll this to more people, right? Because you want more people to see it. Now, there's also something else that happens too. When your video goes live and let's say people are commenting, they're liking, they start sharing it, they're also watching for a long period of time. Now your watch time is super, super important. And you can find this in your analytics. And I believe if you go to audience, I believe I'd have to... Let's see.

[00:31:59.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'd have to pull it up. Yeah, if you go to analytics, I mean, in your dashboard, it shows you a little bit too. Sorry, I've got it pulled open.

[00:32:04.380] - Serena Appiah
I know. I'm looking to see.

[00:32:06.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So if you go to analytics and you scroll down to the analytics part of your studio, it'll say average view duration for each video. It'll give you percentage as well. Yes.

[00:32:15.300] - Serena Appiah
So if people are watching this video, if YouTube sees that people are actually watching this video and not just watching, but they're actually clicking and liking, and sharing, they're going to say, okay, we want more people to see this. More people to see this. I had a video that went viral. It was crazy. I did not even expect this. But it was a video that I had made over this little tykes, Playhouse. It was just something that I didn't even think that it was going to be a great video. I didn't think anybody was even going to like it. But because every project that I do, I film it regardless of whether it's going to be amazing or not. I just film it and do as good of a job as I can, it started going viral. In one month, I had 25,000 subscribers just from this video. I think now it's had 2.8 million views, which is insane. But what's crazy is that people who didn't even have children were watching this video. People who had pets were watching this video because they said, This would be great for my animals. People that were interested in tiny homes started watching this.

[00:33:18.700] - Serena Appiah
But because people were so interested in this video, it just started pushing it out, pushing it out. So my audience.

[00:33:26.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Loved it. I'm now interested in this video. I'm like, Oh, yeah.

[00:33:30.460] - Serena Appiah
Well, it's there. You probably will see if you go to Thrift Diving on YouTube, you'll see it or just type in Thrift Diving, Playhouse. There's actually two there. One took off and went viral. The other one is just puttering along. So it also, too, depends on your content, right? The content you're doing, again, getting back to actually creating something that people want to see. But it's also doing all these things, making sure that you're engaging people with the cards and with asking them questions and really showing them something that maybe they haven't really seen before. That's really important, or just answering their questions to common problems. So once the video goes live, you actually want to stick around for a good hour or two, depending on how well the video is performing. Because what I found is that when you reward people with commenting back, they're more likely to leave another comment for you. How many times have you looked at a video, watched a video, and you've loved it and you've made a comment, and you just crickets? You never hear back from them. You're less likely to want to leave a comment on that channel again if you never hear back.

[00:34:38.720] - Serena Appiah
For myself, the more popular my videos are, it's hard to respond to every single person. But if someone goes to the comments, and even if they didn't get a particular direct.

[00:34:49.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Response- They see you're responding in general.

[00:34:51.700] - Serena Appiah
They see that you're active in that community, and you're active. And I call it a community because I do look at it as my channel is a community. If they do see that you're active, they're more likely to leave a question for you. So, again, that's interaction. So your responsibility is to really go in there and answer it if you can, or even just give them a little heart. You can click the little heart to let them know you saw it, you appreciated it. Even if someone just says, I love this, because you'd be surprised how many channels will host videos and they never go back and they have nobody monitoring it. And it's easier for us if we're just individual blogger, YouTuber, but companies sometimes don't do this. They have somebody upload the video, but there's no one who's given the task of actually responding. So make sure that you're doing that, responding. But then you also want to come back and look at how the video is performing. Now, if you have the YouTube creator Studio app, it's wonderful. If you open up the app on your phone, it'll actually tell you how your video is performing compared to your average.

[00:35:55.570] - Serena Appiah
So if you go in there and it will tell you, okay, you're normally getting between, let's say, one day after, you're normally getting 15,000 to 30,000 views, and you're only getting 8,000, it'll tell you, hey, this is a little lower. So that might give you an indication that, okay, well, maybe I can change the thumbnail or maybe I posted it at a time when people were not really watching videos, if I posted it 3:00 in the morning, which never happens, but using that is an extreme case. There is another way that you can try to re-promote this. So you can actually go back and try to re-promote this on your social media, because we know with the Facebook algorithms, not everybody sees things, so you can re-promote it. But also to a lot of people don't know that they have a community tab on their YouTube page. So this is a tab that it's like your wall. It's the wall of your YouTube channel. And you can actually post there and re-engage people because as they're scrolling through their feed, they're actually going to see, Oh, okay, well, Serena posted a picture. I didn't see that video.

[00:37:01.740] - Serena Appiah
Let me go click that. So the company that I talked to and did a YouTube consult with the other day, they didn't even know they had a community tab. And they wanted to engage their audience more and grow their channel. And I thought, you've got some of these old videos that are working. Not only can you re-promote your new stuff, especially if it's not performing well, but you should routinely recycle some of your evergreen content, right? These posts, these videos that are just doing well. Yeah. Where is- Go back and use that. I'm sorry?

[00:37:36.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Where do you find the community in your... Okay, so- It's on your channel page, I think maybe.

[00:37:42.910] - Serena Appiah
Yes. So if you go to your.

[00:37:44.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Youtube- Oh, there is a setting in the analytics. You can do some settings on their community, it looks like.

[00:37:50.220] - Serena Appiah
Just- Okay. Yeah. I think at this point, I think everybody has the community option because the brand that I consulted with, I know they were at about 15,000 subscribers, and I know they have the community tab. Now, if you don't have it and you're under 10,000, maybe there could be a subscriber limit. But check if you don't see it, generally what I do, I'll check a brand's page. If you go to just their YouTube channel, you'll see some tabs, you'll see- I think I.

[00:38:20.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Have seen that. I don't have it on mine, but again, I've not done a whole lot with YouTube. But I think I remember seeing it, and there is actually just because I want to make sure people know where to find the stuff we're talking about. If you go to the studio side of your YouTube and you go to settings, there is a community setting where you can set moderators and proved users and hidden users and blocked words. If you want to block links, people are posting links and dropping, spamming your community, basically. That's always an option too. Right.

[00:38:54.040] - Serena Appiah
For myself, when I go to a channel, I'll see home, videos, playlist, community, channels, and About. So there's a little menu bar there. So if you click on Community, and you can do this inside of the YouTube app as well, if you click on Community, you can actually post there. It looks just like a wall, right? Now you can't post videos there, but if you have a nice still shot, you can use the still shot and then just write a little blurb, Hey, in case you missed this video that I post the other day, here's a link to it. I have some great tips on painting furniture or how to save money, whatever it is, that thing, how to block.

[00:39:32.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I'm looking at her community right now, guys, that you should definitely check out.

[00:39:37.070] - Serena Appiah
Right. So the other day or last week I went to the thrift store. I had found a... Oh, my gosh, it was $25. It was a China cabinet. And I wasn't sure if I was going to strip it or paint it. Well, I think I've decided that I was going to paint it. And I posted a picture of it on my wall. And I said, Hey, what would you do? What would you do with this? And out of, youknow, pretty good number of-.

[00:40:01.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It had 400 comments.

[00:40:02.700] - Serena Appiah
Yeah, I mean, almost 400 comments. That's 400 people that... Now, okay, granted my YouTube channel, and I don't know if I even really had described my YouTube journey, but I have 304,000 subscribers. Now, of course, not all of them. There's people that I'm subscribed to that I never see them in my feed. There's always going to be that amount of people who just they subscribe, but they never see you. But these are 394 people who saw it, who are engaged, and they wanted to comment. So the more people who comment, the more people who are going to see it, right? And another thing, too, with my community tab, if I'm busy working on projects, I don't think I've uploaded a video since, gosh, it might have been a couple of weeks now because the holidays was here. It was two weeks ago, so I'm due for a video, actually. But sometimes if I'm not able to get a video up, I'll definitely use that community tab. Or if I want to make sure that there's still views coming on my videos, I'll go ahead and just send out an old video or post an old video with a link on my Facebook page, just trying to bring people back so that the channel still stays active.

[00:41:16.890] - Serena Appiah
You never want your channel to just sit there and do nothing for you because YouTube will see that. And I'm sure that's part of the, yes, that you should be doing something just to show that it's an active channel. And some other things you might want to look at, too, when you're looking at your analytics, because there's a whole bunch of things you can dig into. It can be overwhelming. But when you're looking at the audience retention, you'll see a couple of patterns, right? So one of my patterns, for example, with this playhouse Makeover. It's a six-minute video. It's not very long. Generally, my videos are even longer. That's something we didn't really talk about too. People might be wondering, Well, how long of a video should I post? Honestly, I think it's up to you. It's up to how long do you feel you need to talk about this topic? For me, I never really follow the rules of, I know people don't have attention span, so I'm going to give it to them short and sweet. No. If I need to post a 20-minute video on a project that I did, I'm going to post the 20-minute.

[00:42:14.430] - Serena Appiah
And I know that most people are not going to watch 20 minutes, but guess what? There's going to be.

[00:42:18.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Something- People who are doing the same project will.

[00:42:20.360] - Serena Appiah
Yeah, people that need to know that information will. And if I post, let's say, a three-minute video, maybe people watch for two minutes. If I post a 20-minute video, maybe people were watching for four minutes. So I'm getting more watch time, I feel, with longer videos.

[00:42:38.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And one thing to add is if you are new and you're not able to monetize yet because YouTube has certain limits, one of those factors is watch time.

[00:42:49.240] - Serena Appiah
Exactly. Exactly. That's a.

[00:42:51.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Good thing to know.

[00:42:52.990] - Serena Appiah
Right. So don't feel that you have to wrap it up real quick and just do what feels comfortable for you. And when you're looking at this audience retention. And I would say based on what you see in your analytics. Like, for example, when I was looking at my analytics the other day and prepping for this YouTube consult, I noticed in the first, and I think this may or may not be true for other people, I'm not sure, but I noticed that there is an immediate drop and then it levels out. And that's because when I do my videos, I'm usually doing a 30, sometimes even 50-second intro, which is actually a little long. But the people that I'm talking to are the people that I know who are my subscribers who want to hear me give that intro and have a little bit of personality. But I could test a series of videos and then say, Okay, instead of doing a longer intro, I'm going to do a shorter intro. And then I can go into the compare to and say, What happens with my watch time and my drop off, my audience retention, if I do a longer intro versus a shorter?

[00:44:04.650] - Serena Appiah
How much am I able to retain people? Are they going to stick around longer? Because I jump right into it. So instead of saying, Hey, guys, today on my channel, we're going to talk about furniture makeovers. Because remember last week, blah, blah, blah, versus in this video, I'm going to show you three things. I can do it both ways, and then I can test that to see. But what I like to tell people is do what feels comfortable for you. Don't get up in trying to just do all the things that people tell you and make sure your videos are this link and make sure you do what feels comfortable for you. If you want to get on there and talk a little bit more-.

[00:44:42.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You're going to attract the right people.

[00:44:44.590] - Serena Appiah
You're going to attract the right people.

[00:44:45.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That- You're going to tell the wrong ones, which is just as important. You don't want everyone to love you.

[00:44:50.270] - Serena Appiah
Exactly. The right people are going to love you. So the people that comment on my channel, they don't mind watching a 30-second intro. And people who come and want to drop off, I might be okay with that. Because if they're just coming because they just need to learn something and move on, well, there's other videos that may be able to do that for them. But another thing that you can do too in your videos, if you do have a longer video, you can actually use timestamps. So what this is, is down in the description, and this is really easy to do. All you have to do, let's say you do a 10-minute video and you're talking about how to start a blog. Well, maybe at the 30-second mark, and all you do is put, I think it's like zero, colon, three, zero. You're literally just typing in the timestamp in the description. And so that's giving your audience a table of contents because they might be looking for something specific. So definitely don't be afraid to allow people to jump around because they're going to find you to be much more valuable. Maybe they want to listen to your intro, but maybe they just want to skip to the part at the two-minute and 37 second part where you're giving them that one tip.

[00:45:58.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And it could be they know what they're doing with their project. They just don't know how to do this one step. And so maybe they're asking you for that one step of whatever... We're using furniture as an example because that's what I know. But yeah, it could be like, I don't know how to do this one thing. And that's.

[00:46:16.400] - Serena Appiah
Also good, too. If you are breaking things down into timestamps, you're actually describing what's happening at that timestamp. So think about what YouTube wants to see in the description. They want to know what this video is about. So if you've got a time stamp with how to strip furniture, make sure you're doing this, or what to do if your furniture paint bleeds through with a stain underneath. Somebody might be going to YouTube typing in furniture paint, old stain bleeding through. And that video may pop up because you actually told them that that's there at the two-minute and 37- Grouping.

[00:46:53.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Paint or something. Yes, same idea.

[00:46:55.980] - Serena Appiah
Yes. So not only are you providing value, but you're also telling YouTube what your video is about so that it can be discovered. So get comfortable with your analytics. Again, look at who's watching your videos? What's the age range of the people? I was actually surprised that I had more men watching my videos than women because on my blog, it's completely opposite. I mean, the amount of men that I have reading my blog and finding my blog is this much compared to the women. But on YouTube, more men are finding my videos. So you might want to tailor your content to that age group and all of that's in your analytics.

[00:47:33.730] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. If you go to the analytics and then the see more like we did before, you can then go to like viewer age, viewer gender.

[00:47:43.420] - Serena Appiah
Exactly. And what I found is that the younger people, of course, are watching less and the older people are watching longer and the women were watching longer. So even though the men were made up more of the audience in terms of watch time, women were watching for longer. So if my target audience is women, and I generally think that it is because I'm all about empowering women to decorate, improve and maintain their home. I've been doing this channel since 2012 and my blog I've had since 2010, and I really aim it towards people who are in a home and they really want to be self-sufficient and comfortable doing projects, and whether they're decorating or whether they're doing home improvement, that's who I'm targeting. So I would probably make my videos be longer because I know women are going to watch them. And if it's for men, I probably have a completely different more, Okay, I'm going to show you three things to decorate your home. Boom, boom, boom. Bam, I'm done. You're out. Go have a beer and watch football.

[00:48:41.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Not.

[00:48:43.580] - Serena Appiah
That women can't do that too, because.

[00:48:45.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Women like that. No, but men, yeah, it's just just men are like, I'm used to like phasing out. What do I need to know? I need to get it done, check it off my list.

[00:48:56.360] - Serena Appiah
Right.

[00:48:56.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So just make sure- I'm going to look at the bigger picture and the additional story helps with that.

[00:49:01.190] - Serena Appiah
Yeah. So just make sure you know who your audience is, dig into it. And there's tons of videos out there that will teach you how to do this. But now that I'm telling you that it's important, just make sure that you are monitoring your videos and comparing them. And don't be afraid to try different things. So much.

[00:49:18.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
More about the information I have access to on my YouTube channel with my, I mean, teeny tiny channel. It's got like a hundred subscriber. It's not a lot because I haven't done much with it. But now I'm like, Oh, I didn't know. I might get the itch to go back.

[00:49:34.010] - Serena Appiah
What are you talking about on your YouTube channel? What's your content?

[00:49:37.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A brief question. So the very first videos that I posted that I said I didn't know that you could schedule were for my massive GDPR guide to help people understand GDPR because I have a legal background. But then my more popular ones are like, How to become a full-time Pinterest manager, or how to schedule video pins on Pinterest. I've worked as a Pinterest manager for a couple of years now. What blogging courses I found helpful, things like that.

[00:50:06.520] - Serena Appiah
So are you looking for new clients?

[00:50:09.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm actually not.

[00:50:10.950] - Serena Appiah
Oh, God.

[00:50:12.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm actually looking to phase out clients, but I can certainly recommend a resource for you to find some if you want to. Yes, you can. Yeah. But yeah. So it's interesting to me. And the video that took off is actually that full-time Pinterest manager. It's way above the others my analytics recently, and I'm like, Oh, I should. And I just came out with a freebie of how to free a bunch of pins quickly. And I'm like, I should make a video of that.

[00:50:39.230] - Serena Appiah
Yes, you should. And then get them from YouTube. A lot of times people say that it's hard. I mean, YouTube, of course, doesn't want people to leave YouTube. You can get them to leave YouTube if you want, but you can keep them there. But definitely have that be something in the description. If you want this free guide, click here to get it, sign them up on a list, gain that traction.

[00:51:03.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Well, this was insanely helpful. Thank you so much. Any final words? I know people should definitely check out your site, Thrift Diving. But any additional words? Yeah.

[00:51:17.920] - Serena Appiah
So what I would say is keep going. Don't get discouraged. It's so easy to get discouraged when you just want to grow your channel so much and make money from it. This is what I do full-time. And I've been doing this from 2012. And if I looked at my chart of how I succeeded over time, really a lot of my growth happened in the last year and a half, really. And like I said, I've been doing it since 2012. So do it because you want to serve your audience because you love doing videos. And that way, when things happen, when there's a downturn or you suddenly have to now... What's that?

[00:52:01.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Something goes viral. It's like a. Yeah, you're.

[00:52:04.400] - Serena Appiah
Doing it because you love it, not because... I mean, of course, you want to make money doing it and things like that, but you're doing it because you love it. I think about all those years that I was doing videos and, you know, I'm getting a little views here and there, but I just did it because I loved it and I was just good at video. And once you start doing it over and over and over, you get better at it. Sometimes you have the downturns, but guess what? Sometimes you do something that really takes off. And those couple of videos that really do exceptionally well can bring in thousands of subscribers, people that just love you and want to see more of what you're doing. And then you can start recycling some of your old stuff because they may have never seen some of your old stuff. So just do it because you love it and continuously try to improve, but don't beat yourself up if you feel like you're not growing because you're doing because you love it. I believe that when you love something, you're just naturally going to Excel at it because you're going to improve and get better.

[00:53:01.160] - Serena Appiah
Yeah.

[00:53:01.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I always feel like, especially in the long world, if you're not embarrassed or cringing at some of the first blog post or videos you create, you waited too long to put something out there.

[00:53:12.030] - Serena Appiah
Can I tell you real quick the first video that I had ever done? I ended up not using the footage. The very first video that I did in October of 2012, it was a video on how to paint your brick fireplace. And I happened to find one of the old cuts that I didn't include in the original video because I realized it wasn't a good cut. And it was so crazy. I'm standing there and I'm talking to the camera sitting on the table and my hair was out. And I'm literally putting my hair up in a pony tongue. I'm like, hey, guys, so today I'm going to talk to you about this product. I mean, I wasn't smiling. I'm putting my hair up. And I just I found this. And I actually have been meaning to include it in a video, just like one of those it's my anniversary type videos just to show people how bad it was and where I've come from.
