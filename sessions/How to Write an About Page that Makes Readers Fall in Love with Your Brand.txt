Hello and welcome to my presentation. It's all about how to write your about page to connect emotionally with your readers. So, you're going to learn how to build trust on the second most visited page on your website, which is, of course, your about page. So, before we get started, I just want to introduce myself for those of you who don't know me, I am Krista Walsh and I'm an SEO website copywriter for small business owners and creatives. So, basically, this means that I create the messaging for my clients websites, so that a couple of really important things happen.

[00:00:48.980] - Krista
The first thing is, that their website gets found on Google by people who are actively typing in what they have to offer, and to then their website takes those visitors on a journey from that very first impression all the way to becoming a paying customer or lead in their inbox.

[00:01:09.870] - Krista
Okay, so let's jump right in and start talking about why your about page matters in the first place. So, I think we all know that you're about page matters, but I brought up some stats here to kind of prove it.

[00:01:22.410] - Krista
So, the first one is that 52% of website visitors want to see a company's about page right after landing on their home page. So, over half of people are going right to the about page after they land on a company homepage, which says a lot about how much customers really care about learning about companies.

[00:01:43.960] - Krista
Also, 81% of consumers buy based on how much they trust a brand. 86% of consumers say that authenticity is a deciding factor when their purchasing. And 77% of consumers want to support people who share their values.

[00:02:03.120] - Krista
So, these last three statistics are really important because this is all stuff that an about page helps you do. It helps you build trust, it helps you establish authenticity, and it helps you show people who you are, like what values you espouse. A lot of the stuff that consumers are looking for, they're going to go looking for it on your about page, and your about page is the perfect place to show them all of this.

[00:02:30.570] - Krista
So, in short, a good about page establishes your blog or business or brand as trustworthy, authentic and relatable. So, how do we get there? That's what we're going to learn today.

[00:02:46.530] - Krista
So, to start, I want to share the top three about page mistakes that I see all the time as a Web site copywriter and just make sure that you are avoiding making these as you sit down to write or edit your about page.

[00:03:01.080] - Krista
So, the first one is throwing away your headline. So, what I mean by this is not using your headline wisely on your about page in particular. So, a lot of times people will write their headline, and it just says about or about me or possibly my story or they won't have any headline at all on this page, they'll just jump right into a photo of me and here is my little bio. Or sometimes their headline will just be like, "Hi, I'm Krista", for example. So this is a mistake because eight out of ten people only read the headlines on any given Web page. So, your headline has to do one of two things on every Web page. And you're about Page is not an exception.

[00:03:52.190] - Krista
Your headline either has to give away the most important information, kind of like a newspaper headline. So, for the people who aren't going to bother to read the rest, you want them to get it just from that headline. Or it has to be enticing enough to help people want to read the rest of the copy on your page. And these examples here, like just saying about or not having a headline or just simply like stating your name and your headline those don't accomplish either of those two things.

[00:04:25.740] - Krista
So, here's a really great example of a common style of headlines that I see on about pages. So, you have to scroll down really, really far to actually get to the meat of this page. And all we get way above the fold is about me. And that doesn't really help us learn anything new about this company and it doesn't help us want to read the rest of this page.

[00:04:50.470] - Krista
So, mistake number two is what I say, what I call keeping it corporate. So, these are about pages that feel like they're ripped right from a business plan. So, they have like a mission statement and a vision statement possibly. There's not really a personal story. Everything is written from this vague we, so we don't really know who's talking to us in this moment. Sometimes there are stock images and all of this is a mistake because remember why people are going to your about page and what a good about page does; builds trust, it's relatable, establishes authenticity. And an about page that feels super corporate and vague and boring does none of those things. So, this is really a missed opportunity if you think you need to be super professional on your about page.

[00:05:47.420] - Krista
So, this is an example of kind of a middle of the road in the corporate zone about pages from a client of mine, before we wrote her about page. So, this is her previous page. And just everything from the design to how it's written just feels very corporate and a little bit boring and doesn't truly reflect the really personal nature of her service. So, she says things like, "I hand-select exceptionally talented, credentialed and ambitious writers who are laser focused on putting client needs first, etcetera." And that just reads very job interviewee. And it's not what clients need to hear in order to feel really connected to your brand. So this was a missed opportunity for her company.

[00:06:34.590] - Krista
So, mistake number three is an interesting one, and it is when I see really, really often and that is simply making your about page kind of hard to find. So, usually this goes two ways. So, either hiding the link way in your Web site footer and not having it in that top navigation, so you don't have a tab at the top that says about it's just in your website footer.

[00:07:00.180] - Krista
So you're expecting readers to really hunt around for your about page. And that's a missed opportunity because a lot of them won't find it. They won't bother to find it. And then you're losing out on that that chance to make this, like, really deep connection with them. And then two, people who are having to look for it sort of feel a little bit like weird about that, like why why can't I find it? Is this company real? Like, they don't have a story I wrote about. And then the second way people make their about page hard to find, is by naming it something cute and warm in the navigation. This one, I think, is one that a lot of people are surprised to find it's a mistake. So, people who name there their about page tab at the top like my journey. Our story. Explore our past or, I don't know, something that feels very clever and warm and you can tell what they're trying to do, but actually a lot of people won't recognize that as an about page. And so, they're just going to not find what they're looking for and feel a little weird. Also, Google likes things named really clearly, so that when they crawl your site map, they know how to categorize a page, and an about page of something that they're going to want to pop up. When somebody types in your business and Google, you want that about Page showing up. Right. And naming it something cute will maybe prevent that from happening. So, save the warmness for the copy on your about page and just make it really straightforward because we've got to get people there first, and then you can be clever and cute and fun once you're once they're there.

[00:08:45.380] - Krista
So, Larabar is actually a good example of a company that did this. So, they have to tabs actually they have one that says our story and one that says our values. And if I were were doing their page, I would just have it say about and then include both their story and their values in one place; because that's where people are naturally going to look for it.

[00:09:08.450] - Krista
Okay, so now that we've gone through these mistakes, I want to share the three about page writing secrets that if you get nothing out of this presentation, I want you to get these. So, pay attention. Feel free to screenshot any of the slides or the examples, especially that I'm giving here, so you can refer back to them later as you're writing or editing your own about page.

[00:09:32.090] - Krista
So, secret number one, share what you do or offer as clearly as possible in your H1. So, your H1 is your main headline at the top of the page. So, remember when I said that your headline needs to either give people that newspaper style of here is- here, here's the whole story and a headline, or it needs to entice people to keep reading. So, if you're not a copywriter, I recommend doing the first one because it's- you can't make a mistake there.

[00:10:07.610] - Krista
So, give readers the through line that they're looking for when they're heading to your about page. So, some ways to share what you do or offer as clearly as possible in your headline is to just state your unique selling proposition. So, that's the answer to the question of why or how are you different or why people should hire you or buy from you. You could use the formula, I help blank do blank so that they can blank and just make that sentence your headline. You could even really make your mission really concise into one sentence and just make that your headline. So, here's an example. So, Gary, Gary Schultz of Inward Voyage was a client of mine, and I did some strategic editing of his website. And this is how we changed his about page. So, originally he had this throwaway about page headline that just said about Gary Schultz, and I changed it to share his mission instead. So, now it's a "Through and word voyage, my mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit." So, right away, even if people don't read anything else, they're getting the vibe of Gary's business and they just get a lot more out of this.

[00:11:25.930] - Krista
And it also does inspire them to read a little bit more than just about Gary. Right. So, secret number two is to use a story framework. So, this is for anybody who feels like, you know, I want to share my story, I love stories, but my story is so all over the place, it's kind of wishy washy or I just don't know how to condense it into something that people will remember. Screenshot this slide because this is for you. And surprise, a lot of people feel that way because life is not this beautiful, tight narrative. We have to sort of massage it to fit into there so that our brains can remember it. And that's totally okay.

[00:12:10.440] - Krista
So, when you're using this framework, the biggest thing you need to have in mind is this general idea of a transformation that you experienced either related to what you sell or offer or related to the why you started your business. So, sometimes those are one of the same, sometimes they're different, either one. So, just have that in mind.

[00:12:35.240] - Krista
And big picture, we want to give people a before picture before you have that transformation, that really specific turning point. So, the moment when something changed, then the after picture, how your life is better or different now and then we don't want to just end there. We don't want to end the story with the end of your story. We want to remember that we're talking to customers here. So then we have to pivot it and say, you know, this is my offer.

[00:13:06.860] - Krista
Here's how I can help you now. So a great way to use this general framework is to use the Pixar storytelling framework. And I've got that up on the screen here and basically. It's once upon a time there was me, so you were me, right? This is you're basically stating where you were before and then the next to your reiterating, well, you're digging a little bit deeper into your story, into your story before.

[00:13:38.610] - Krista
So every day I would do this or think this and it was horrible. Then one day something changed. And then because of that, I did this or I had this negative or positive experience. And then because of that, I actually tried something new or I sought help or had this wave of clarity. And then finally, I found a solution, I realized something profound, I solved my problem, and then now everything is better for me. And then at the end just say, and now I can help you get this solution to.

[00:14:15.550] - Krista
So. This is a lot and it's kind of hard to wrangle together. But I want to give you an example of what this can look like. So, this is a client of mine, Nina Lohman, and she runs a company called Indica Dreams, which is a CBD company, and I wrote her about page for her loosely using that Pixar storytelling framework.

[00:14:40.970] - Krista
So, if you want to screenshot this, I'll move my little picture out of the way to give you an idea of how you can get creative with this framework and how it can flow and be really memorable. So. She starts off, you know, we share her before, which is she found out her mom had cancer, she was really scared. We dig deep into this before state and then something happened for her. Right. She found CBDs. And then because of that, she starts researching it. She starts experimenting on herself. Because of that, she decides to actually pursue it full time, getting a degree in alternative medicine. And then finally she starts her company to solve this problem for everyone else. And at the end, we have this neat little pivot back to the reader and we say, "This is where Indica Dreams comes in a CBD brand for people who want to thrive. I'm so glad you found us."

[00:15:48.430] - Krista
So, secret number three, is that you can share more than just your story, so I love the story part of about pages, but you can also share other things to help build trust and authenticity and be relatable. And some of those I have you have up here on the screen so you can share your mission. You could share your why. So, why you started your business, what keeps you going, your values. That's a really good one to kind of break up the tax and give people a quick hit idea of what you're all about, your commitments to causes. If you do any donations or if you volunteer, you just really passionate about a cause. And fun facts; so something that's a little bit lighter, you know, like are you a coffee person or a tea person? Those are great ideas to share.

[00:16:43.380] - Krista
So, here's an example of a client of mine, and we included this value section that was both her values and the design of her jewelry. She's a jewelry company and also her values as a person.

[00:16:56.130] - Krista
And so people can read these and feel like, yeah, this is what I'm looking for in a company, or, hey, these values feel good to me. This is what I have to do. And it's just another way to establish that trust and relatability on your about page.

[00:17:11.430] - Krista
Okay, bonus secret- actually, I said there were three, but here's a bonus one, remember that your about page is part of the customer journey. So, if you're thinking you're going to write your about page in a vacuum. So, this is especially for folks who want to sit down and think about it like a bio. So, you're like, I just got to have my photo and like my little LinkedIn bio and that's my about page. And it's sort of separate from the rest of my website. No. You're about Page is very much part of this whole customer journey, which means it's part of your job as a sales person to sell yourself for your products or your brand.

[00:17:55.830] - Krista
So, I'm going to give you an example of a page that I helped one of my clients with to showcase some of the ways that you can think about your about page as part of this big sales journey that your customers go through. So, my client Merchant Method, this is her about page and a lot of the first half is her story. So, that's what all of this is. And then, of course, we have this pivot here at the end. Bringing it back to the reader and then this is really what I want to talk about, this section here. So, at the end of her about page, she didn't just leave the customer saying, "Well, that was my story. Wasn't that nice?" Because she's thinking about her about page in terms of her larger customer journey. So, she wants them to not stop on her about page because she can't make a sale on her about page. Instead, she wants to funnel them back to where she wants to funnel them back to. So, for some of you, that might be adding a call to action that simply says shop. But for my client, it was to add them to her email funnel. So, she had an invitation to stay in touch by taking the retail success style quiz, which fed them into a really, really successful email funnel of hers.

[00:19:31.260] - Krista
So, whatever you want people to do next, whether it's shop, checkout or services page, join your email list, follow you on Instagram. Where do you want this journey to go next after your about page? And you need to have something at the end to push people where you want them to go. Don't just let the journey end here.

[00:19:56.570] - Krista
Okay, so I'm sharing this this is my client, Mike, because I just want you to know what's possible for you when you really have this emotional connection with your readers on your website, including on your about page.

[00:20:11.210] - Krista
So, Mike is a portrait photographer, and he experienced an immediate spike in client inquiries directly from his website, from strangers who found him online in the height of a pandemic. So, being a portrait photographer, this is not something that just, you know, that people were like clambering to spend money on in the middle of covid-19. But because his website made such a powerful emotional connection, people were feeling it. And they're like, "I want you." And he says, "I've gotten half a dozen increases in the past month and consistently get compliments on the website. Not only that, no one bats an eye at my pricing. I've never been in this situation before. People see my value and want to hire me no questions asked."

[00:20:58.070] - Krista
Wouldn't that be amazing if your website could have this connection with people and just do this for you before you even get them on the phone or before you have to email them or take them for this long marketing funnel? Right. So, that's what's possible for you when you really nail this.

[00:21:18.040] - Krista
So, I have given you a lot here to make your about page awesome and actually sell for you. But I know it's a lot. So, you can also download a lot of this information, plus additional information and a really easy to follow checklist that you can have beside you as you're writing your about page, her editing your current about page. It's free and you can grab it at www.KristaWalshcopyrighter. Com/aboutpage checklist. So, screenshot of this page if you want to remember that link.

[00:21:59.880] - Krista
All right, at this point, let's open it up for any questions that you might have, I'd love to answer them.
