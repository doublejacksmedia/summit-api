Hello, I am Liz Willcox, I am so excited to be a part of this Summit thanks for picking my video out of all of those videos to watch. This is called Write It Yourself How Bloggers Can Write Their Own Copy in three easy Steps. Now, let me tell you, look at this. I feel like I'm in the middle of a party here. So let me tell you this. Number one, I want to keep this really simple.

[00:00:36.910] - Liz
When I say three easy steps, I mean it. This is going to be a pretty quick video. I don't want you taking copious amounts of notes. I'll make a little ding, so can hear that. I'll make a little ding sound when you need to listen up or I'm going to my next point. Really, you probably these are so simple, you probably don't even need to write them down. And then at the end, obviously, I've got a freebie for you if you want it.

[00:01:06.190] - Liz
If not, no harm done. You got the info you needed. Like, seriously, this is three easy steps. So who I am, I'm not just another Liz in the Summit, but I've been blogging for about four years. I've been copywriting, right now I mainly focus on email marketing. You see some of the digital products I've created over the years. Some people have even said nice things about me. But basically all you need to know is that I like to keep things really super simple.

[00:01:38.620] - Liz
And first I had a blog and now I do email marketing and copywriting. So as far as copy goes, seriously, this is how simple I want to keep it for you. There's only really two two things that you need to know about copywriting in order to be successful. Number one, you have to be clear. I know we want to be clever. And, you know, even the title of this talk was write it yourself like that's cutesie, right?

[00:02:06.790] - Liz
But here's the subtitle, How Bloggers Can Write Their Own Copy in three easy steps. That is super clear, right? You don't want to, you don't want to be clever when you sacrifice being clear.

[00:02:18.430] - Liz
And number two show who you are. Obviously, you're watching a video. You can kind of see who I am. Like, obviously, I probably have a kid. There's still like a Halloween bucket, even though you're probably watching this in January. I'm wearing my N*sync earrings.

[00:02:34.570] - Liz
I've got you know, I've got these crazy glasses. This headband, this wild hair. So you can see my personality and you can kind of get a sense for who I am. So you want to try to do that in your copy. And I'm going to show you, I know that's the most like, "ug, how do I do that Liz like that's so easy to say." And, you know, especially you Liz have this loud personality. But I'm going to show you one of these steps, how to, like, just show who you are.

[00:03:07.360] - Liz
So let's get right into it. Here's the thing, OK? That means listen up. So Number one, I want you to use swipe files. And if you don't know what a swipe file is, I'm going to show you. But basically a swipe file is like a Google doc or a PDF that someone like me, a copywriter or maybe an old school blogger has put together for inspiration. A swipe file is not a template. It doesn't mean you can take it.

[00:03:40.630] - Liz
It's not like an ad lib thing where it's like blank here, like insert your product here. You know, it's not a template, but it can be used as kind of a pseudo template where you go in, you look at it, you get inspiration, you kind of see how the flow of an email or a sales page or your website copy works so that you can take it and make it your own. Use this swipe file to take and make your own, ok? Take and make your own see simple as that.

[00:04:10.390] - Liz
Right. So I'm going to actually show you a file. So this is actually my freebie. This is my freebie for everything, not just the Summit. It's a swipe file and it gives you a welcome sequence newsletter, examples and fifty two subject lines. But the welcome sequence, as you can see, you can just scroll through and you know, this is the email I sent out to everyone that first email. Let me click on it here so I can you know, this is the second email, the third, the fourth.

[00:04:45.790] - Liz
And you can just read through these and I'm not the only copy writer in the world that has these. You can probably just Google email, swipe files or sales page files and find them. But I also want to show you how to make your own. So what I do, this is my personal email account and so lets say, you know, I go to my inbox, I've got all these emails, Lanie Lamare, she's amazing. Let's say that I really like this email and you know, it does something for me.

[00:05:20.480] - Liz
I want to write something like this one day. What I'm going to do and this is for me, remember, I'm creating my own swipe file right now. So I'm going to send this and I'm doing this live right now. So I am just going to send this to myself over in my business account because I keep my personal on Hotmail and I keep my business over here. Outlook, it looks like we just got a new email and I'm going to take this email.

[00:05:49.640] - Liz
I'm going to click on it. This is the one that I did. Now you all have my personal account. Please don't spam it. And I'm going to move this to an account or to a folder I call Copy Inspiration, and I'll go down here and show you. And this is where I keep, where I mostly keep all of my swipe files, emails that I find that I really like. And then also, so and then you go to your Google Drive.

[00:06:21.350] - Liz
I want you to do this. And where is it? I keep it right here. Marketing swipes. So this is where you can put. So what I showed you was obviously email related, but this is where you can actually keep, you know, full webinar sequences, sales pages, things like that that make sense for you. So I hope that makes sense. Let me pull back up my screen. Where am I? OK, here we are.

[00:06:58.850] - Liz
OK, sorry, and I lost my scene. I'm OK anyway, so that is a swipe file. I hope that makes sense for you. And let's move on to the second tip. See, super simple. Also, remember, I have swipe files. Other copywriters have swipe files. We want you to use these. I want you to go and find sales pages that you like and a print, print the actually, let me show this. This is completely not something that I wanted or that I had planned on showing.

[00:07:36.380] - Liz
But let me just show you. So here we go. So I have something called It's in my chrome. Where is it? Here it is. Nope, sorry. It's called Go Full Page. It's an extension and you can click on this and it screen captures everything. So it's going to say you like a sales page, you go to my website, you like my home page, you, you like the Summit, Blogger Breakthrough Summit page and you can screen shot it and then you can download it to a PDF and then you can put it right here in your marketing swipes.

[00:08:17.760] - Liz
Does that make sense? All right, so moving on, this is a tip that I don't see a lot of copywriters using, but it seriously has saved me so much time, effort, exhaustion, write your copy on paper first. So obviously, if you're talking about your new email newsletters, no, you don't need to write it on paper first. But when you're talking about writing your homepage, copy your sales page, copy something that's really maybe a sales email that you really want to get.

[00:08:49.230] - Liz
Right. I suggest writing it out on paper first. I have all sorts of notebooks let me show you, this one, actually, this one is pretty full and it's all, it's all the emails, everything I've ever want to write. So this is on the top TVC Black Friday email sequence. And you can see I've even written like I'm going to send it Tuesday, the 24th. This is the subject line. And then here's the content. And I do this for two reasons.

[00:09:20.400] - Liz
And the first being, it stops you from editing yourself. So when you pull up a Google doc or however Microsoft Office, however you do your emails or your sales page copy or whatever, when you go to write your copy, when you're staring at that blank, that blank screen, it's so intimidating. And then let's say you write three sentences and then in your brain you have a better idea. So you immediately erase at least two of those sentences and you start over.

[00:09:48.460] - Liz
And so you're constantly editing yourself. Does this resonate? Does this make sense? Like raise your hand if when you write something on paper, Number one, it takes a longer time. And so when it takes a longer time, you don't want to edit yourself as much. Right? Like, I'm trying to see. So here's some emails I was writing today, and I'll pull these up on my docs in a second. And so I'm like this.

[00:10:13.410] - Liz
I literally wrote out name. Right. That takes a while. So I don't want to keep editing. You see, like I haven't scratched out not s-h-i-t. I haven't scratched out anything. But when I go to and let me show it to you, I'm going to share my screen again. When I go to write the emails, that's when I can edit. So that's I haven't even typed this one out yet. But email four which is what I just showed you here.

[00:10:45.060] - Liz
It's going to go here. And as I'm typing it out, that's when I can do all the editing. That's when I can say I don't really like the way I worded the sentence. It would be better this way or that way. And so that is what that is why I suggest you write it out on paper first. You're going to get it out quicker. It might seem kind of counterintuitive, like why would I, why would I do that?

[00:11:13.260] - Liz
You know, it's it's faster to type. You just said it was it takes longer to write it. But the thing is, most of us, especially as bloggers, we cannot self, we can't help but self edit. We write, we write for a living. Right. We're content creators. We can't help but self edit. And so when you write it on paper, first you get rid of all that self editing and then when you type it up, when you get your homepage ready to go, you can type it up and that's when you can self edit and it's going to save you so much time.

[00:11:45.240] - Liz
I promise. Try it. All right. So that was the first thing was, you know, use swipe files, number two write it down on paper. And this is the third and final thing. See it like I told you, simple. Here's my little sound effect. Ask yourself, would I really say this? OK, so I want to show this in action as well. You know, when when you're typing it back. So, number one, you've got your Swipe file open.

[00:12:18.270] - Liz
You know, you're writing your sales page. OK, you know, these are the FAQs, this is, these are my bonuses, whatever, whatever, you know, and then you go to type it once you've got it typed out. I want you to read it out loud or in your head, whatever your style is, you do you. I want you to ask yourself, would I really say this? Because if you get my swipe files, of the way that I talk is completely different than the way you talk, then the way Liz Stapleton talks, then the way whoever talks, everyone talks or says things in a different way.

[00:12:59.550] - Liz
So I'm just going to go and I want to share my screen one more time and I'm going to pull this up. Let me see if you can see this. Let me move that out of the way. OK, so this is my home page and I want to use this as an example because my copy. Obviously, I'm a copywriter is very strong, I have a very strong personality, and the way that you say something is not the way I'm going to say it.

[00:13:25.620] - Liz
So as you're using a swipe file, let's say you screenshot capture my whole homepage, you go through and you write and then you're you're uploading it now. You're reading it out loud. So this the headline, raise your hand if you've ever paid for a month of email but never sent out a damn one. Maybe you don't say damn. So you cross that out. Don't fret, babe. You aren't the first one and you ain't going to be the last.

[00:13:52.770] - Liz
So if you're a more formal person or let's say, you know, you're a crochet blogger talking to moms, you could say like instead of don't fret, you might say, don't worry, my friend, instead of babe or mama or whatever. And you know, you aren't the only one. Instead of you aren't the first and you ain't going to be the last or you aren't the first, and you're definitely not going to be the last. And so just go through and read it out loud and ask yourself, would I really say this.

[00:14:26.400] - Liz
So I'm going to read this out loud and you tell me if it sounds natural. You've known me, what, 15 minutes, but it says, raise your hand if you've ever paid for a month of email but never sent out a damn one. Don't fret babe. You aren't the first and you ain't going to be the last. But I do want you to knock that crap off. That sounds just like me. So as you go through your copy, that's what I want you to do.

[00:14:48.690] - Liz
The last step after you've used a swipe file, don't write from scratch. It's too hard use a swipe file. Number two write it on paper first? Because you are going to stop all that self editing when you are manually putting each letter down. And number three, when you do get it ready to go that final step, all you got to do is read it out loud. Ask yourself would I really say this? You know would I really say "don't fret." Like, does that sound like me or is that just what Liz wrote? And I'm writing it?

[00:15:22.050] - Liz
Don't I normally say, don't worry instead, something like that. I hope that helps. And last like I said, this recording, I wanted it to be super quick, very simple. If you know one thing about me, it's that I love myself and I don't like to work too hard. So I wanted to make this as simple as possible for you and put it in the simplest terms.

[00:15:46.470] - Liz
I started out as a blogger. I used to have a RV blog. I used to travel around the country and share my journey with people. But when you live in an RV with a three year old, two hundred square feet, limited Internet, you've got to make things simple. So this is how I did, how I started writing my copy. And so this is the simplest way and I want you to have it.

[00:16:13.650] - Liz
But if you're if you're ready to get started with swipe files, ding, let me show you what I'm bringing to the table. Let me just exit out so you can see this. You don't need to see my face everywhere. So this is my swipe file. What you're going to get is a welcome sequence. So these are mainly email swipe files, which that's my expertise. I already showed you how to get, make swipe files for sales pages and stuff with that screen capture.

[00:16:46.230] - Liz
But if you really want to get started writing your own copy, I suggest doing it in email because email marketing has the highest ROI and that's how you're really going to get to know people and show people who you are and where you're coming from. So I'm going to give you a welcome sequence, which I showed you right here. And then you're also going to get three newsletter examples and fifty two subject lines. Let me show you these subject lines and I can... These fifty two subject lines have gotten me over forty percent open rate for every one of them.

[00:17:24.060] - Liz
And you can already see I put X, Y, Z. So if you're a crochet blogger do you have any questions about crocheting. If you know, if you blog about boy bands, why do you hate Backstreet Boys. If you are blogging about writing resumes, help my or indeed.Com is killing my soul, something like that. And so you can just take these. Like I said, don't ever write anything from scratch. Use a swipe file.

[00:17:55.620] - Liz
These subject lines are really going to get you going and give you lots of ideas on how to write your copy and what to write. So I hope that helps. I am so honored to be a part of your copy writing and blogging journey now. So just click the link below and get that freebie and get started. And to wrap it all up, remember, this is just three ways you can write your own copy. And number one, use a swipe file, let me pull that up, number two write it on paper first so you stop all that self editing.

[00:18:33.900] - Liz
And number three, ask yourself would I really say this. And if not, then, you know, that's when you need to start editing and changing things up from the swipe file. All right. I hope you have a great week here at the Summit and I'll see you soon.
