Hey there. Welcome to Inbox Joy, themed email newsletters for effortless marketing. Thank you so much for joining me today. Get ready to supercharge your emails to make your subscribers feel seen and appreciated so you get more sales. Before we get started, please be sure to grab a notebook or your favorite planner so you can take notes because I don't want you to miss a thing. Ready to find your Inbox Joy? All right, let's go. If this is the first time we're meeting, please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Sage Grayson, and I'm a former book editor turned life and business coach. Since 2011, I've been helping ambitious women entrepreneurs edit their habits, routines, and mindsets to balance their happiness at work and home. Or as I like to say, I'm a life editor, and so are you. I'm a vegan, bisexual Buddhist who loves reading self-development books and quoting The Simpson endlessly. You can find me on YouTube for my business channel, YouTube for my reading channel, Facebook, Pinterest, and of course, my blog, sagegrayson.com. Here are our course objectives. First, we're going to talk about why email newsletters are the number one marketing tactic you should be using to build trust, Keep your audience engaged and get more sales.

[00:01:33.100] - Sage Grayson
We like that. You're also going to learn how to use theme newsletters to crank out content faster and help your subscribers hone in on the information they need next. I've also got a dozen newsletter theme ideas to spark your creativity so you can plan your themes as soon as possible. Then I'm going to show you how to take your email newsletter up a notch with advanced theming tactics. Let's get right into it. Let's talk about email newsletters 101. Email newsletters are recurring messages sent to subscribers to share valuable content, updates, or promotions. I think we recognize what an email newsletter is. Basically, somebody will sign up for your email newsletter through one of your freebies. This is called permission marketing, where you're going to give them something cool and exciting, and in return, they give you their email address. That's how you build your email newsletter subscriber list. For online business owners, newsletters are powerful marketing tools that build customer relationships and increase loyalty, trust, and brand recognition. Just think about the email newsletters that you receive. You definitely recognize those brands and you learn to trust them over time. Here's the thing. Regular engaging newsletters keep your business top of mind.

[00:02:51.600] - Sage Grayson
I have said this a million times. When somebody is ready to buy whatever it is that you sell, we want you and your business to be the person that they think of. Newsletters also encourage clicks, they drive sales, and they lead to consistent customer engagement. We want all of these things for your business, and that's why you really must set up your email newsletter. Now, email newsletters work best when you give your subscribers some variety. Yes, we don't want the same old thing all the time. You don't want to send duplicates of the same email over and over and over again. Because if your audience gets bored of your messages, they might unsubscribe. We don't want that. We want them to stay subscribed so they know all about your new products and offers. Now, a great way to keep their eyes on your emails is to choose themes so they can anticipate your message and hone in on what's important to them. You got to make it fun. I can't stress this enough. I get so many email newsletters that just aren't fun. It's like a straight wall of text and they're super boring. You've got to have some fun with your email newsletters.

[00:04:00.840] - Sage Grayson
You started your business for a reason. Don't you want to have fun with it? If your email newsletters are fun, then your readers are going to keep opening them, and we want that. Okay, so why do we want themes for our email newsletters? Can't we just send an email newsletter and be done with it? Can't we just wing it every week and write about whatever we want to? Well, yeah, sure. Of course you can. But I guarantee that your life and your business will run a lot smoother if you just take the time to choose some themes for your newsletters. Here are some great reasons why you should start using themed newsletters. First, it's easier content planning. So themes act as a guide for each newsletter, so you know exactly what to include. You're not sitting there in front of the blank screen thinking, What am I supposed to be talking about? What should I put in this newsletter? With a clear topic, content creation becomes so much faster and less stressful We like that. We like less stress. I mean, you've got a million of other things that you need to be thinking about for your business.

[00:05:06.630] - Sage Grayson
So let's make this easy. Themes also build anticipation and engagement. Subscribers look forward to your specific themes, like maybe you have the Fun Friday email or a Wealth Wednesday. This consistency keeps your audience engaged and excited for what's next. I definitely recognize when other business owners are using themes, and I'm so excited. I'm like, oh, it's tip Tuesday, what tip are they going to give me? We want people expecting your emails and looking forward to opening them. Themes also give your newsletter and your business cohesive branding. So theme newsletters create this recognizable rhythm to your brand, making your emails memorable and strengthening your brand identity. I bet you have definitely recognized some business owners that do the Monday, Wednesday, Friday emails, and it definitely has a rhythm to their information. You know when you're going to get something good from them. Themes also improve readability. I can't stress this enough. You need to have themes that make your emails easy to read. So when subscribers know what to expect, then they can quickly find the information relevant to them, increasing open rates and engagement. This is not a long wall of text, which I see too many times.

[00:06:23.470] - Sage Grayson
You've got to make your emails scannable. And this starts with a clear banner, probably with whatever theme that email newsletter has. Short paragraphs. I keep my paragraphs no longer than two lines of text, like short, easily scannable paragraphs. And lots and lots of headers. You want to break up the text. Use headers, use bullet points. Make your email scannable. Because let's face it, as much as we want our subscribers to read every single word that we send them, they're not. They're just not. When you have themed email newsletters, you can make them scannable, you can make them shorter, more to the point, so people can find the information they need quickly. You might also try themes with a segmented focus. Now, I will say this doesn't apply to everyone, so it may or may not work for your business. But themed content also allows you to target various aspects of your business, like membership updates or product promotions, so that each audience segment receives relevant information just for them. So you can absolutely segment your audience. Maybe you send things to the business owners or just to the moms or just to the people who bought this specific product, or maybe people who don't have that specific product.

[00:07:38.280] - Sage Grayson
I definitely recommend sending your marketing emails to people who do not have a specific product. There's nothing worse than getting an email for a product that you've already bought, especially if it's on sale now. If you don't want to segment your audience or if that's not in alignment with what you do for your business, you can just send your emails to everyone. And this is what I do. So I do have a membership subscription, and I send those emails to everyone, not just the people who are in the membership. That way, I am promoting it to the people who are not in the membership and they're seeing all the good stuff that they're missing. And I'm reminding the current members that they need to log in and get more value out of their membership. And that way, they will stay in the membership and keep paying month after month. Themes also encourage action. You know what that means? Sales. Themes naturally lead to calls to action or CTAs tailored to each topic, whether it's joining a membership, purchasing a product, reading a new blog post, watching a video, sharing feedback. You're encouraging them to do something within that themed email.

[00:08:46.400] - Sage Grayson
You're never leaving them hanging. You're always leading them to the next step. I've got a dozen theme examples that you might want to try out for your newsletters. Let's start with Membership Mondays. I see this one a lot. And before we go further, I do want to say that though a lot of these are themed to specific days, you don't need to make an alliteration. You don't have to actually put the day of the week in there. That will also give you the option to send these emails anytime during the week, not locked into a specific day. If you do have a membership, I recommend sending a membership email at least once a week. Like I said before, it's going to show the people who aren't in the membership everything that they're missing so that they join, and it's going to encourage current members to stay engaged in the membership and keep paying. How about a testimonial Tuesday? Or this could be Success Story Saturdays. Either way, you're going to highlight the people in your business who are getting those good results. Yeah, let them brag about you and your products and services rather than you just saying how great you are.

[00:09:49.820] - Sage Grayson
It's always nice to show someone who has gotten success doing whatever it is that you're teaching. That way your audience can self-select. They'll look at the testimonial and say, Hey, She looks just like me. She has a business just like me. And look at the results that she got. Testimonials and success stories also make your current subscribers want to get good results so they can appear in your next testimonial newsletter. How about Wealth Wednesdays? This would be great for a finance coach or a law of attraction coach or anyone who's helping you earn more money. Maybe you've got a great tip to help them increase their sales, or maybe you've got a mindset shift that they need to make if they want to earn over six figures. How about Training Thursdays? This could be for any type of trainings that you have. Maybe you highlight a different free training every Thursday that they can opt in for and learn something new and it can gently upsell to one of your paid products. Throwback Thursday. Oh, yeah. Let's get retro here. I bet you have tons of old blog posts, old videos, or content that's just sitting around your shop not being sold.

[00:10:58.210] - Sage Grayson
So how about you highlight a a throwback every Thursday, something that they've probably forgotten about. Or if they're a new subscriber, they definitely haven't read or haven't watched that video. So bring it back to the forefront with a throwback Thursday email. Fun Fridays are super, super popular because sometimes you have things that just don't fit anywhere else. Maybe it's not promoting one of your products, maybe it's not saying what bundle or summit you're in. Maybe it's not a testimonial, but it's things that you do want to share with your list. You can have a roundup or a catch all email and make it a Fun Friday. So everything that doesn't belong somewhere else gets put into the Fun Friday email. This is also your chance to be a real person and show them that you're a human just like them and you're doing fun things with your life. Maybe show them some behind-the-scenes details of your life, of your business, or how you do the things that you teach. How about a Saturday sales spotlight? You could highlight a different product or service in your shop every Saturday and really shine the spotlight on it.

[00:12:02.490] - Sage Grayson
Don't assume that simply because you have a shop or an everything page, that people have seen all of your offers. They haven't. And something that you released three months ago, six months ago, a year ago, I definitely know that people have forgotten about it. So bring those offers back into the forefront and highlight a different product every Saturday. A Sunday roundup is also a great way to end the week. Very similar to a fun Friday. It's all of the stuff that doesn't really belong anywhere else. You could gather up all the important things that happened during the week, the bundles and summits that you're in, the blog posts that you published, the videos that you released, any new items in your shop, and just have a long list of things that happened that week so they can catch up quickly. I know some people even have the option where you can subscribe simply to their roundup and not all of their other emails. That way you're getting fewer emails, but you're getting the one that highlights everything they missed. Speaking of highlights, how about affiliate highlights? You could have an email to your affiliates or to everyone on your list talking about your affiliate program.

[00:13:09.430] - Sage Grayson
If you do send it to everyone on your list, you're reminding them that you have an affiliate program and they can sign up and earn some money, and you're reminding your current affiliates to share their links and get paid again. You might even give them swipe copy or some tips to help them earn more money with their affiliate links. You might also share a success story from one of your affiliates who is out there earning a lot of money with your links. Tools and tips Tuesdays? Yes. I bet you have lots of software, books, tools, resources, and other things that you use. You could share those affiliate links in a roundup email with all of the other tips that help you do what you do in your business. I know I always love seeing what other bits of software and resources people are using to get those good results. So have an email that shares all of these tips with your subscribers. And I'll put this one in here too. It's a monthly email, but it's monthly must haves. So maybe it's everything that you really enjoyed this month. The things that you bought on Amazon, the blog post that you loved reading, other people's products and offers.

[00:14:13.440] - Sage Grayson
Maybe it's even seasonal things that go along with the holidays. Everyone loves seeing a wishlist, so show your subscribers your must haves in this roundup email. All right, I've got some advanced newsletter tips for you if you are going to be using these themed newsletter ideas. You can experiment with frequency. You knew I was going to say this. I send daily emails to my list, and that might work for you, but you could switch it up. Maybe you do three times a week, like a Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Or you could do weekly if you haven't been sending email newsletters often. Simply going from monthly to weekly newsletters can definitely increase your engagement and help you get more sales. I want you to give yourself permission to test different frequencies for your themes to see what really resonates with your audience. And make sure that you can keep up with that schedule yourself. Then you could also try seasonal or holiday variations. You can adapt themes to reflect the seasons or holidays, making them feel fresh and timely. This is something I do a lot with my business. For example, you can adjust your Fun Fridays to include year-end best of content in December.

[00:15:20.200] - Sage Grayson
Or you could try a self-love series around Valentine's Day. There might be specific holidays or times of year that are important to you and your field, so take advantage of those. Again, this is all about having fun with your newsletters, because if your email newsletters aren't fun, then no one's going to read them. Use A/B testing. You can experiment with different subject lines, formats, or content within each theme. So A/B test two versions of your Membership Monday newsletter to see which one has the higher open rate and click rates. So for example, you might put your call to action at the top of the newsletter for one, and then at the bottom of the newsletter for the other, and see which one gets more opens and more clicks. Leverage user-generated content. Encourage subscribers to contribute stories, tips, or photos, and then feature them in your newsletters. A theme like Testimonial Tuesdays can showcase real customer feedback, making them feel connected and involved in your business. You definitely want to repurpose your theme across multiple platforms. So use your newsletter themes as content inspiration across social media, in your blog posts, in your videos, or community content.

[00:16:32.210] - Sage Grayson
This makes it so easy. You don't have to come up with something new to share in every single one of these platforms. Repurpose anything you can. And then I, of course, love time-limited content. You can use dynamic elements like real-time countdowns within your themes. For instance, a Saturday sales spotlight can feature a limited time discount on a product. I do this all the time. This is why it's important. This trains your subscribers to open your emails in a timely manner so that they won't miss the deals. I think we all have times where people don't open our emails for days and days, and then they miss out on something. If you have these limited time offers, they're going to open your emails the moment that it pops into their inbox.
