Hello, hello, everybody. My name is Kristen Rappaport and I am the founder of KristenRappaport.com and the Brand Boss Design Club, where I help online entrepreneurs better manage the design side of their businesses. I teach on tons of topics including DIY branding, graphic design basics, and of course, all things Canva. I am a graphic designer by trade and I have been designing for what seems like forever.

[00:00:40.960] - Kristin
I think I'm pushing 20 years now. I've designed for ad agencies, inhouse marketing departments, and clients across the United States. But what I am most passionate about is designing for my very own online business. I've always known that branding and graphic design are crazy important for making your mark in the online space. But it wasn't until I started my own business did I realize how powerful it truly was.

[00:01:05.760] - Kristin
You see, when you are your own designer, you are in so much more control of every single thing that you do to run your online business. Plus, hiring a designer can be really expensive, which means that you're left to figure it all out on your own and you have no other choice than to put your DIY designer hat on and make stuff happen. You're probably aware that every single thing that you do to grow your blog or online business involves some level of graphic creation. People are visual creatures. We first see with our eyes before we even consider reading anything, which means that your online presence and what your graphics look like matters a lot.

[00:01:44.770] - Kristin
Over the last couple of years of designing for my own business, I've boiled it down to three key factors that have the most impact in your online presence, and those are your brand image for creating consistent graphics quickly, graphic design skills, so the graphics that you are creating actually look professional and mastering your design program. If I had to guess, I would say that most of you who are here watching this training right now are using Canva. In fact, if you're a Canva user, go ahead and drop your favorite emoji in the chat right now. I know firsthand how incredibly overwhelming Canva can be regardless if you're just getting started or you've been using the app for some time now.

[00:02:25.620] - Kristin
You probably have hundreds of designs that you've created, multiple design files for your Instagram graphics or your Pinterest pins and whatever other graphics you're creating to market your content. You probably have a ton of old templates that you've downloaded a long time ago that are collecting digital dust bunnies and tons of images uploaded to your Canva app. You know, you have a lot of assets, but for some reason, you can never find anything you're looking for. You end up recreating designs over and over and over again, and you're spending tons of time creating graphics that should really only take you 15 minutes. Maybe when you open your Canva account, you're so overwhelmed that you don't even know where to start.

[00:03:02.950] - Kristin
Your Canva account is a hot mess, isn't it? If your Canva organization could use a little or a lot of TLC, give me a heck yes in the chat right now. I just want to be clear. This is nothing to feel bad about. You haven't done anything wrong.

[00:03:17.980] - Kristin
Unfortunately, it's way too easy to let your Canva account get a bit out of control when you're creating magic and working in the margins of your time to make it happen. And the best part is is that it's totally fixable. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret that just may change the way that you design in Canva forever. Organization is everything when it comes to streamlining your design process and maximizing your time spent designing. When your Canva count is in tiptop shape, you're going to save yourself tons of time designing.

[00:03:50.440] - Kristin
You'll always be able to find exactly what you're looking for, be it a specific design document or an element or stock photo. Your graphics are going to be much more consistent and you're going to have so much more confidence as you create them. Simply put, an organized Canva account can streamline your entire design workflow. And I don't know about you, but I don't have hours to waste fiddling around in Canva looking for that template, searching for that stock photo, or recreating designs. So, what are we waiting for?

[00:04:21.310] - Kristin
Let's jump into it. Organizing your Canva account can be broken down into five easy-to-follow steps that will transform your hot mess account and nonexistent design process into a streamlined system that will save you tons of time and make you feel like a total brand boss. Before we actually jump into the training, I want to share with you my biggest Canva tip. And if you leave with one golden nugget from this training, let it be this. When you open Canva, I want you to stay far, far away from the dreaded Canva home screen.

[00:04:55.000] - Kristin
This right here is the Canva home screen. This is what you see when you open your Canva account. And while you have all of your recent designs down here in the bottom, it is really, really hard to find anything that you're looking for if you are searching through these designs. When you jump into Canva, the first place that I want you to go is over here in the projects tab.

[00:05:16.260] - Kristin
This is a much more organized view of everything inside of your Canva account. From here, you can see all of your folders, all of your designs, all of your templates, all of the images that you've uploaded, and all of the videos that you've uploaded. Once you go through the five-step process that I'm going to be sharing with you today, this is going to make so much more sense. You are going to realize that this is your home base. When you are in the projects view, you'll have access to all of the folders that you're going to be creating, and you're going to be able to locate any designs or elements that you're looking for super quick.

[00:05:50.350] - Kristin
The first step in organizing your Canva account is to set up your brand kit. The brand kit is a Canva Pro feature only, but to me, this feature alone makes the small investment of Canva Pro totally worth it. To set up your brand kit in Canva, you're going to want to click over here in the left hand where it says, Brand. You're going to be brought to a page that looks like this. When you're setting up your brand kit, you want to make sure that you have all of your different logos uploaded.

[00:06:16.590] - Kristin
I even like to have white versions in case I want to use them on a dark background. You want to add all of your brand colors right here into this section. You can simply just click the plus button and drop in the hex code of your color. You don't want to add your brand colors in the order that you want them to be displayed because you're not going to be able to move them around afterwards.

[00:06:37.000] - Kristin
So, for example, I have my core brand colors over here, followed by my dark and light neutrals, and then my action color, which is this bright yellow. I also add in some tints of my colors because sometimes I need a lighter version of a specific color. You're also going to want to set your brand fonts over here in this area. And Canva has tons of fonts to choose from, but you can also upload a font, maybe you downloaded from another website or purchased someplace else.

[00:07:04.510] - Kristin
When you're pairing fonts, you do need to make sure that they go well together and that they have the same overall vibe and tone of your brand. I like to pair a bolder headline font with a font with a little bit more personality, like a script or a handwritten font, but this is going to be different depending on your own unique brand and business.

[00:07:22.620] - Kristin
Setting up your brand kit is going to make your fonts easily accessible from this left menu. Anytime you need to add text to your document, your color palette will also be displayed in the left panel, ensuring you stay on brand every single time. Once you have your brand kit set up, your fonts determined, all of your colors in the color palette area, the next step is to clean up your design. So, if you're anything like me, you probably have hundreds of designs floating around in your Canva account.

[00:07:55.080] - Kristin
They're all scattered about, and all of these designs need a home, so you can find them and repurpose them if needed to save yourself some time designing. So, let's pop back over to the projects tab. Remember, this is going to be your home base, not the Canva home screen, and this is where you can locate all of the designs that you've ever created. There are two views here. What you're seeing now is the grid view, and what I like about this is that the designs are bigger and easier to see.

[00:08:26.640] - Kristin
And you can also hover over any of your designs to see all of the pages that are in that design to get a better idea of what it is. If you want to view all of your designs in the list view, just click this little button up here to view it as a list. And when you're in either of these views, all of your designs are organized by the date you created them or last access them. So, if I scroll all the way down, you will see that this last design file was created one year ago. Occasionally, they will be out of order, and I'm not quite sure why this is.

[00:09:01.450] - Kristin
It might be because this design was a template that was shared with me. But in general, all of your designs are going to be organized from the date you created them or last access them. You can use either of these views, whatever works best for you. When you're cleaning up your designs, I recommend that you start at the very bottom of the list or grid view, since these are going to be the oldest designs in your account.

[00:09:27.300] - Kristin
From here, you can begin deleting designs that you no longer need or use. Maybe you've rebranded, or it's a graphic for something that you no longer use. Maybe they contain outdated information, or maybe it's just a terrible graphic that you have always been ashamed of. You can delete documents one by one by clicking into these three dots over here on the right hand side. And then click move to trash.

[00:09:51.540] - Kristin
If there are multiple designs that you want to delete, you can select multiple. And then right down here at the bottom, you're going to see this trash icon appear. So, just click move to trash. All of the designs that you move to the trash will live inside your Canva trash can for 30 days. Another key part of cleaning up your designs is renaming your designs.

[00:10:14.070] - Kristin
Because all of your designs in Canva are actually searchable. Oftentimes, if you create a design, by default, canva will just name it Untitled Design, which is not helpful at all, especially when you're looking for something specific. So, you'll want to go through and name all of your designs, something that you would search for. So, for example, if it's a Pinterest pin file, name it Pinterest pins, Facebook ads, lead magnet, etc. To rename a design, click the pencil icon and change it to whatever you like.

[00:10:45.870] - Kristin
Anytime you're looking for a specific document, we'll use Pinterest, for example, all of your designs that have the word Pinterest in them will show up in your search results. Additionally, any folders that contain that term will appear in the results as well. If you want to take this a step further. You may also want to pop into your design documents and delete any pages inside them that you no longer need.

[00:11:10.770] - Kristin
As you are deleting and renaming your designs. Keep a mental note about what types of designs you often create, almost like categories. This is going to help you later when it's time to plan up and set up your folder system, because all of your designs will eventually find their way into a folder. Once your designs are all tied up, it's time to do the same thing for your upload. This can be a little bit time consuming, depending on how often you upload your own assets to Canva.

[00:11:39.870] - Kristin
And just like your designs, you can see all of the images that you've ever uploaded here in the Images tab. You can view them in a list view, or you can view them in the grid view. The images are also arranged by date, so scroll all the way to the bottom to find your oldest images. This can take a while, especially if you upload a ton of stuff like I do. Once you get to the bottom, you can then start deleting images you no longer need or use.

[00:12:09.810] - Kristin
To delete image individually, click these three dots over here and then move to trash. To delete multiple images at once, you can select the checkboxes and click the trash icon down here at the bottom of the screen. It's important to know that if you delete an image that is currently used in one of your designs, it will show up as an unlinked file and appear as just a gray box. So, if you're questioning any of your images, it's safer not to delete them. As you're cleaning up, you can also rename your images, but I don't worry too much about renaming them because unlike the design, your images are not searchable from this top search bar up here. But if you think it would be helpful for you, then you can go ahead and rename them.

[00:12:54.190] - Kristin
While you're digging deep here into your image, do take note of the types of images that you're using often. Maybe you have a lot of stock photos that you use, or maybe you have a lot of images of stuff that you designed to put in a portfolio. Thinking through these things is going to help you plan and create your folder system in the next step. If you have a ton of images that you've uploaded like I do, then this will probably be the most time consuming part. Once you have your images cleaned up, you can do the same thing for any videos that you have uploaded to your Canva account.

[00:13:26.970] - Kristin
Once your designs and uploads are tied up and you have a much better idea of both the types of designs you create and the types of images or videos you often use in your graphics, it's time for the fun part, which is planning and creating your folder system. And your Canva folder system is an absolute must to keeping your account organized. Folders are searchable and they are really easy to access. You can access all of your folders by going into the folders tab in the projects section of your Canva account. And this is the biggest reason why I recommend that you had here into your projects tab first, when you open up Canva. Because it's all organized and you'll be able to see everything laid out.

[00:14:09.100] - Kristin
At first glance, this folder system is very similar to a folder system that you might have on your laptop or desktop computer. So, let me tell you a few things about folders. Each folder can contain up to 200 items at the time of this training that was just recently bumped up from 100, which is so great if you've got a ton of stuff in your account to keep organized. You can also create subfolders inside of folders to organize yourself even more. And each folder can contain designs, images, and videos.

[00:14:42.040] - Kristin
There are three folders that are standard in your Canva account. You're not going to be able to delete these. And those are your purchase folder which will contain anything that you've purchased inside of Canva, your starred folder, which will contain any templates or elements or stock photos that you have starred to possibly use for later, and the uploads folder.

[00:15:03.480] - Kristin
This uploads folder contains the same items that you're going to find in your images folder and your videos folder. There's no right or wrong way to create your folder system and it will be totally unique to your business and what you're creating. Everybody's brain compartmentalizes things a little bit differently. So, just create a folder system that makes sense to you. And of course, what you're creating in Canva, your folder system is kind of like a living growing thing and you can always create new folders as you need.

[00:15:31.710] - Kristin
Move folders, put folders inside of folders, and move things from one folder to another. Hopefully, as you are cleaning up your designs and all of your images, you took a note of the types of things that you often create. To create a new folder in your Canva account, go into the folders tab located in the project. Up here in the right-hand corner, click add new, then click create folder.

[00:15:55.470] - Kristin
Inside this folder, you can create multiple subfolders to organize your account in the way that makes the most sense to you. I'm just naming these folders test for now, but you will want to name these something very intentional because just like your designs, all of your folders are searchable as well. The last step in organizing your Canva account is to actually move your designs and images into the correct folders. We're going to go back over into the projects tab, click into designs.

[00:16:28.360] - Kristin
I think this is easier in the list view, scroll all the way to the bottom and start moving each design into one of the folders you created. To do that, just click these three buttons move to folder, your projects, search for your folder and drop it into any folder or subfolder. You can do that individually, or you can also select multiple designs, click this folder at the bottom of the page and drop them into their new home. As you move your designs into folders, you'll notice that they are removed from this big, long list of designs, which is great because you know exactly what you have left to organize. Sometimes, you might have some designs that you're not really quite sure where they go, but you can create a miscellaneous or random, whatever you want to call it, folder to drop in the designs to sort later.

[00:17:20.650] - Kristin
Once you have moved all of your designs, you can then get started on moving your image. If you have a lot of images uploaded to your account, like I do, this could take you just a little bit of time. How you decide to organize your images is totally up to you. Just like all of the designs, once you move an image into a folder, they will be removed from the main list, which is great because you'll know exactly what you have left to organize. Once your Canva account is organized, you may be wondering, okay, Kristin, so how am I actually supposed to use this now?

[00:17:54.510] - Kristin
So, I'm going to share with you some tips that will maximize your time spent designing, thanks to your organized Canva account. I've already shared this first tip in the beginning of the training, but it's so important that, it's worth sharing again. Make it a habit to go straight into the your projects tab. This is where you're going to see all of your folders, which is going to make it very easy for you to locate what you're looking for. And you're also going to see the recent designs that you've been working on if you need to pop into one and finish something up.

[00:18:23.050] - Kristin
The next tip is to design in long running documents. For example, I have all of my YouTube thumbnails in one growing document, which makes it super easy to quickly pop in, edit text, change out the stock photo, or create a new design and copy and paste text or elements from designs I've already created. I do the same thing with my Pinterest pins. And doing this makes creating consistent images a lot faster because you're not always starting from scratch. I've already mentioned in this training that your designs and your folders are all searchable in Canva.

[00:19:02.730] - Kristin
So, even though you may have everything organized in a folder, you might know exactly what you're searching for. And you can head up to the search bar at the top of the menu, type in any search term, and down below, you're going to see all of your designs that contain that term. That's why naming your designs and your folders intentionally is very important. Big tip incoming, the folders icon in the left panel is going to be your very, very best friend.

[00:19:33.430] - Kristin
When you're inside of any of your design documents, you've probably noticed that you can access templates, elements, uploads, photos, and all kinds of different things in this menu. But this menu is also a great place to keep folders that you use often. For example, if you have a stock photo folder that has all of your on-brand stock images, you can keep that folder over here in the left menu. Just click into it and you're going to see all of the stock photos that you have put inside of that folder. Just click and add it to your document.

[00:20:07.680] - Kristin
If you use a lot of mockups of your digital products or lead magnets, you can also access any of the designs that are in that folder and simply click to add it to your design. This is great for repurposing things that you have already created instead of recreating them every single time. Another helpful tip to know is that you can actually move and organize images when you're inside a folder in that left panel. For example, if I was looking for some stock photos to use in my Pinterest pins, and I see these images up here that are clearly not stock photos, you can simply click one or multiple images, hover over the three bars, and move them to a different folder right from the left panel. You can move images one by one into a different folder, or you can select multiple and use this folder icon down here to batch move things.

[00:21:03.150] - Kristin
I know, I know when you are designing in the margins of your time and trying to run your online business or blog, it doesn't take much before your Canva account gets a little out of control. But it's important to keep your account organized. When you're creating new designs, get in the habit of properly naming all of them right away. Name it something that you would search for, so you can find it quickly. Move it directly to its correct folder right after you name it.

[00:21:29.940] - Kristin
Additionally, you can go into the folder where it will reside and create a new design right inside of this folder. When you're uploading images, properly name anything you upload right away and move it directly to its correct folder after you name it. You can also go into the folder where your images need to reside and upload them directly to this folder. As far as general upkeep goes, make a point to tidy up your account every month or quarter, or even after you finish a big project. Consider your folder system organic.

[00:22:02.380] - Kristin
You can always move folders around, add new ones, and delete as needed. Over time, you can fine tune your own organizational system and figure out what works best for you. We covered so much in this short training and that taking the time to organize your Canva account can be a tedious process, but it is so worth putting in the time to create a more streamlined and less chaotic design workflow. And I want to make this super simple for everybody watching. So, I'm going to give you access to the Canva Cleanse Workbook, which includes all of the five steps that I've covered in today's training, a checklist for each one of the steps, tips for creating your own Canva folder system, guaranteed ways to keep your account organized, and even an interactive Canva folder planner.

[00:22:49.140] - Kristin
If you're ready to transform your hot mess of a Canva account, you know, the one where you can't find anything you're looking for into a magical place where you can create all of the graphics that you need to market your blog or business with ease, then grab your workbook. Once you download it, I'm going to be giving you a special opportunity to join me inside of the Brand Boss Design Club, so you can take charge of your visual brand, your graphics, and everything that Canva has to offer.

[00:23:17.790] - Kristin
Inside the Brand Boss Design Club, you'll get access to tons of visual branding tutorials that will walk you through creating your logo, choosing fonts and colors, and even discovering what makes your blog or business totally unique. There are graphic design trainings on topics like Pinterest pins, social media graphics, lead magnets, mockups and more. I'm always working on adding new content into the memory dashboard.

[00:23:40.330] - Kristin
On top of that, I host design trainings and design feedback sessions every month, so you can get one-on-one feedback on anything that you're working on. There's even a Facebook community for getting quick feedback on your work. You'll get access to a bunch of Canva templates and even more resources that will have you looking and feeling more professional online. Go grab your workbook and hopefully, I'll see you inside the club. Bye.
