[00:00:13.310] - Liz, Host
Hey, guys.

[00:00:13.690] - Liz, Host
I'm really excited for this session with Kayla. She has done something really fantastic that I feel like you don't see a lot of, is create a community of bloggers that support each other and work with each other. And I think that is something that's so underrated. It helps so much when you have blogging friends you can talk to and reach out to. So Kayla, welcome. I'm super excited to have you. Thanks for being here.

[00:00:40.170] - Kayla
Thank you so much, Liz, for inviting DBB and myself to your new blogging community.

[00:00:46.950] - Liz, Host
Sure.

[00:00:50.050] - Kayla
Okay.

[00:00:50.840] - Liz, Host
A couple of quick questions I'm going to ask, how long have you been blogging before you started this community of bloggers?

[00:00:58.210] - Kayla
I was blogging probably about two years before I started. So, altogether, I have been blogging for four years. I started off by blogging as a beauty type of influencer. All of my friends were kind of telling me like, oh, I love what you're doing with your makeup trends and certain skin cares and things like that. And so, instead of me always sharing or in that moment, what it is that I was using, I decided to create that blog and so, they can go back and see for reference all the time.

[00:01:29.270] - Kayla
And so, I did that myself. And then two years afterwards, I noticed that there was a need. And the need was that there was not any other blogging communities that were so warm and welcoming. And that really kind of catered to my niche. And the niche was the black blogger community. And I decided that would be something that's really cool and to start.

[00:01:55.450] - Liz, Host
So, how did you get started with it? I guess, would be the next question.

[00:01:59.720] - Kayla
Yeah. So, I went to a couple of blogger events in the Dallas area and really didn't notice. I just noticed there was, like a group of one table of, like, black bloggers and influencers. There were so many other people that were surrounded by us. But there was, like, one table all the time. And, of course, myself, I would just kind of gravitate towards that table because everyone wouldn't be so warm and welcoming. The other large bloggers and influencers who would be there. And of course, I want to take a picture with them and talk to them because I'm like, wow, I see you guys on the internet, but it wasn't, like, as warm and welcoming.

[00:02:35.120] - Kayla
And so when I would go over to the group, we would just like talk and get to know each other. And I was like, oh, this is cool. But really, the thing was when I came home, I'm like, well, how did I feel about that? Like why was there just one table? And I just started doing research on the Internet on Instagram. And I'm like, whoa, there's a lot of black bloggers or influencers in the Dallas community. We should showcase each other. And so that's really how it started.

[00:03:01.430] - Kayla
So, like that night after one event, I went home, did research and found, like, Dallas black bloggers was like, the hashtag was like, over and over and over again. And I decided to create kind of that community, and it's just been amazing since then.

[00:03:17.050] - Liz, Host
Sure. So, two follow up questions for that. First of all, how did you find those blogging events? Because I feel like there's a lot out there that people just don't know about. So, how did you find those?

[00:03:26.120] - Kayla
Definitely. So, I found out those through, like, eventbrite. I would just type in like blogger events in Dallas area, and I was able to locate that and also through Google search, which would be Dallas bloggers. I tried that and that was helpful to get in touch with a lot, get in touch and notice, like, a lot of other bloggers and influencers in the area.

[00:03:51.130] - Liz, Host
Okay. Once you decide to start the community, it's like, okay, I'm going to start this community. I'm in it. How did you get other people to get on board and be excited about it?

[00:04:01.690] - Kayla
You know, honestly, I can tell you the truth. I don't know. I think it's just more so about the willingness for people who just want to be a part of something and wanting to be a part of like.

[00:04:14.170] - Liz, Host
How did you get it out there that you were creating this community then so people would know.

[00:04:18.380] - Kayla
Yeah. So, a bunch of friends basically, just telling my friends, and then they're just spreading the word and it just kind of spread it all the way out in that area. So, yeah, basically just sharing with my friends and family on Instagram, through socials and through Facebook, you know.

[00:04:38.590] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Don't be afraid to put your blogging stuff out there in your personal feed. Even if people don't understand what you're doing, that's I feel like a strong thing because you talk to some of your family, they still know what you do.

[00:04:51.880] - Kayla
Yeah, they do.

[00:04:55.030] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, how has having this community helped, you helped the bloggers in it? What's sort of been the result other than you know having people to talk to.

[00:05:05.590] - Kayla
You know the result has kind of just fulfilled itself to be quite honest. But the main thing is that there's a real community amongst each other, there's real friends and be able to talk to. But they're making like strides for different partnerships. Like, oh, I see that you guys went to this location. Do you have the contact information for, like, so and so. And I'm like, of course, I'll share that with you. So, them branching out and doing stuff for themselves is like, one of the main things that I wanted to accomplish with this community because it's not just me.

[00:05:40.020] - Kayla
There's a ton of other bloggers in the community. So, I'm like, Yay go out, girl and do your thing. Another thing that I think is really cool is that well, I guess I said it already, which is they're really forming friendships amongst each other. Like, they're really hanging out and getting to know each other. And I feel like that's essential as well and really you know deserve some recognition because they would have never known that this mommy blogger and this mommy blogger are, like, really cool friends, and they can hang out and go do stuff mommy stuff together and create content together.

[00:06:13.100] - Kayla
So, stuff like that. That's why I've seen those type of things kind of just blossom into more.

[00:06:20.050] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Because when you're a blogger, it's easy to be feeling very alone with your computer and the people you live with, your spouse, your partner, your kid, whatever are like, why is she on the computer or he, and so being able to have other people that understand it and can support and help you? You know I feel like networking is kind of a dirty word sometimes, but community is really that's part of it. I think the first ever sponsorship deal I got was a friend was like, hey, I just did this deal with this company.

[00:06:53.040] - Liz, Host
I think you'd be a really good fit. Can I introduce you?

[00:06:55.700] - Liz, Host
Nice.

[00:06:56.950] - Liz, Host
You know it all comes back to people in relationships and being genuine. And so I love that you created this community, especially around a locality that you know I mean local communities are.

[00:07:09.650] - Kayla
Yes.

[00:07:10.750] - Liz, Host
Amazing. Because you built a community which is different from a mastermind, which I feel a lot of people think they need to be a part of. So, have you found that people in your community are forming masterminds? How do you differentiate between the two? So, it's not just, like, a constant, oh, we are coming here to work. Let's hang out type of thing.

[00:07:35.650] - Kayla
Just kind of letting it flow, right. Still keeping an agenda or maybe some certain topics for discussion, but kind of just letting it flow, letting each other introduce themselves and say, hey, my name. Is that's really important? Yeah. What do you mean by Mastermind? 

[00:07:55.070] - Liz, Host
So, I know a lot of bloggers that will, like, two or three friends or something will form a monthly mastermind to work on their goals. And it's really strategy based. Like, yeah, the chitchat is like, hey, you're in the hot seat. What's your problem this month?

[00:08:09.610] - Kayla
Right.

[00:08:10.160] - Liz, Host
Let's kind of dig into that. And they all kind of mastermind around that person for that client.

[00:08:14.890] - Kayla
I like that idea. We haven't quite done that just yet. However, when we do have, like, branches and certain events, we still do talk about certain things that are occurring, something that may be, something that we.

[00:08:26.040] - Liz, Host
It's hard not to talk shop.

[00:08:28.030] - Kayla
It's hard. It's really hard not to talk about you know those things you know that matter to us or may affect us in the long run. So, yeah, we do have those type of topics, but for the most part, we just kind of keep it light and airy and fun.

[00:08:41.310] - Kayla
And just so, everyone can have the opportunity to speak, introduce themselves and just really getting to know each other. Sure.

[00:08:47.430] - Liz, Host
How often are you setting up meetings for your community.

[00:08:51.790] - Kayla
I started 2019 at the end of September 2019, so we were doing a lot of in person, right. Then penny happened, and it was a lot of monthly Zoom. Now that we started to get back out. It's more quarterly approach, but I'm thinking for maybe 2022 to definitely, maybe do monthly again, but still limited amount of people. But trying to do it more often, it seems like a big thing because the bloggers want that, the community wants more events for sure.

[00:09:33.030] - Liz, Host
Sure. How are you coordinating it? Like, how do you decide on the place and then just let everyone know how are you kind of coordinating and deciding how many people can attend, I mean especially these days where you do have to keep numbers in mind. How are you doing that?

[00:09:48.940] - Kayla
Yeah. So, definitely, the main thing is like talking to like the space, the venue space, the restaurant, whatever it is, seeing what it is that they need to, what it is first, and then kind of going out from there. But when I do announce it, I just announced it to the community as a whole. Just like, hey, you guys, we're going to be meeting up at, so and so, sign up here. And so, I usually don't release any type of certain information, like an address until after everyone has signed up. And then I'll share the information, because if not everyone would just come.

[00:10:20.530] - Liz, Host
True. Yeah.

[00:10:22.150] - Kayla
You know, and so, I just make sure that I do that. But yeah, that's what I do. I had everyone sign up if they're available.

[00:10:30.810] - Liz, Host
Okay. And do you try to do it like a different place each time?

[00:10:35.170] - Kayla
Yes. So, I try to do it all over the DFW Metroplex, so sometimes it will be in North Dallas, actual Dallas, De Belle, whatever. So, I try to do a different location and they're not even just restaurants. Sometimes we do coffee meetups just so we can hang out and chat and get to know each other. Or sometimes we have workshops in person. So, it's always different. Exactly.

[00:10:57.850] - Liz, Host
How do you decide between doing a workshop and just like a hangout meet up.

[00:11:04.210] - Kayla
So, yeah, so like, now, since it's about to be December, I mean, excuse me, January 2022, we are thinking about more. I think about more, so what's happening right then? Everyone wants to do vision boards. Everyone wants to get their goals out, the resolutions out for the new year. So, having a workshop like that, is kind of like our workshop based around current events is something that I like to do. Another thing is like, for like, Valentine's Day or for Valentine's Day. Sometimes I do Valentine's events, which is like a restaurant. So, we all get up dressed in our red and our pinks and our purples, and we go out to have brunch or something like that.

[00:11:41.190] - Kayla
So, it's really about like the trends and what's happening during that time. Sometimes for coffee meet up. I'm like, wow, it's been like six weeks, I haven't seen anyone. You guys want to have a coffee meetup, like and just ticket. So, it depends. But, yeah.

[00:11:56.510] - Liz, Host
So, it's not always something that's like, you don't have to have a huge, long thought out plan to make this happen.

[00:12:04.090] - Kayla
Oh, my gosh. No. The simpler, the better. And it feels much better for me as the founder, because I don't want to have to like, you know do all the extra things to make sure I'm planning accordingly. So, absolutely.

[00:12:16.850] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:12:17.300] - Kayla
So.

[00:12:17.550] - Liz, Host
I mean, anyone who's wishing they had more of a community around where they are is totally doable. When you decide to do a workshop, is there anything you're doing specifically to like design it to make sure it's effective, I guess.

[00:12:34.490] - Kayla
Yeah. Sure. I mean, sometimes you know how, like, now everything is so digital. So, I make sure I keep something on campus for everyone to be able to go back. I know that sometimes I have some friends who are like, can you print out, like, a paper, so I can actually write and see? And so, we'll do stuff like that. But for the workshops, it's usually something that they take home. And I always try to give them an assignment at the end, like a call to action. Like, hey, go ahead and check out XYZ to see what it is that you like, whatever that topic was.

[00:13:03.550] - Kayla
The last one that I did was a workshop for email marketing, because I think that a few days before I had announced the workshop, Instagram had shut down. So, it was like, okay, so now you guys see why we need this email marketing workshop. And so, I you know walked them through MailChimp because I like MailChimp and so walk them through MailChimp altogether and just like, doing stuff like that and really just showing them you can do this, too. And not only that, it's not hard, you just have to sit down and do it.

[00:13:46.130] - Liz, Host
Yes. Yes. That's the thing is switching over from learning about it to actually getting it done.

[00:13:52.530] - Kayla
Right.

[00:13:54.410] - Liz, Host
I like that. So it's like, really kind of a last minute throw them together thing. So, you kind of take charge of this. You set this to me. Are you monetizing it in any way or is this really just setting, you know creating relationships, which is plenty of return.

[00:14:13.830] - Kayla
Yeah, so, within the last six months to a year, I have to have the opportunity to monetize off of the business. And the things will be, ways to monetize can be from, like, merchandise that I've had, Dallas Black Blogger, coffee mugs and T shirts and stuff like that. Also, I hosted, like, a conference that was really big conference. Also workshops and the events that I host, like, photo shoots and stuff like that. All those things I've had the opportunity to monetize off of within the last year.

[00:14:57.970] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, I like, all that because we've primarily talked about how you're kind of getting together. You're maybe learning something. You're getting coffee. But like, photo shoots and conference and merchandise. I love the idea. How did that come about? Did it require you to kind of put a lot of stuff up front? Was it really just sort of you made the money because it happened as opposed to having to put a lot of time and money up front for those things?

[00:15:31.250] - Kayla
You know what? To be honest, it varies her thing that you do for. Like, merchandise, you definitely put it the money upfront because it's got to be made. And then you got to ship it out based on if the consumer or the audience wants that product. Right. So, putting out the money first for those is what I've done and what I do. When it comes to events, I do put out money for events as well, maybe, like for the photographer and stuff like that. But you know you have to remember that you have to set a budget and not only that, you have to write out like your cost and what you want to charge per ticket, how many people you got to get real nerdy and accounting with it?

[00:16:18.510] - Kayla
You know what I mean? So that you can make sure that your time was worthwhile and that you may or may not be getting a profit back or what I like to do is at least break even you know get my money back. But you have to kind of like dig deep into that strategy, whatever.

[00:16:40.000] - Liz, Host
We have sessions on the numbers.

[00:16:44.430] - Kayla
yes.

[00:16:44.720] - Liz, Host
As much as we all wish we could just write and it all would come in. There's a lot more to it. There's a business side of, yeah, setting a budget and checking your revenue versus your cost and make sure there's a return on your investment and your time is compensated. It's not just about the money you're putting out, you're putting in time. And just like any job, you need to be compensated.

[00:17:09.450] - Kayla
Absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. And I say that I like to break even because it makes you feel like you're not losing anything, but for sure in this day and age in this time, we definitely want to make sure that we make a profit as well. But yeah, you guys make sure you check out those sessions.

[00:17:27.250] - Liz, Host
Yes. So, if someone wanted to kind of start a blogging community of their own where they're at, or you know what advice would you have for them?

[00:17:38.950] - Kayla
The main thing that I have, advice, I'm sorry that I have for them is basically you just have to be real and authentic and you have to be living doing in what it is that you're preaching. You have to be able to be living in that. I'm not saying you have to be a full time blogger, but I'm for sure saying that blog so that you can be an example, set an example for the person that you're going to be teaching, right. Not saying expert still, but definitely creating that example, showing that narrative, showing that initiative that you are what you say that you, are the next thing I want to say is have fun.

[00:18:17.990] - Kayla
You got to have fun. Because if you take stuff so serious and everyone else around you is going to take stuff serious. Don't want to just be so serious. So, have fun. Have fun for sure with your community you know, and then reach out to your community too. Hey, I have XYZ that I'm going to be presenting. Hey, I want to start a blogger community. Do you mind if you share with me? Like how do I create invoices, like, something so simple or something like that? You know what I mean?

[00:18:47.480] - Kayla
Ask your audience and engage with them as well. Yeah.

[00:18:51.250] - Liz, Host
Yeah, because it makes at least for me, it makes a world of difference to have blogging friends, whether they're local or not, just to be like, hey, how'd you been? Oh, my gosh. Can you> You know. I had a friend one time. I was like, hey, can you just check out my home page? I adjusted some stuff and there's this new post and she's like, I don't see it. Turns out my post like the last six weeks wasn't showing up. You know like how would I have known if I hadn't reached out and they're like, hey, can you, this looks weird to me, right?

[00:19:22.920] - Liz, Host
So, it's amazing. And sometimes it's just there's something that's bugging you that you just can't figure out, but it's so simple and you ask and they're like, oh, yeah, just do this and it takes them 5 seconds to explain it. And you know, that huge hurdle that you've been trying to overcome just gone.

[00:19:40.540] - Kayla
Gone. Okay. Where were you 6 hours ago when I was stressing?

[00:19:44.560] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. Is there any sort of tools or resources you use to help keep organized in terms of what you're doing with your community? Yeah.

[00:19:57.870] - Kayla
So, what main thing is that I love my PayPal account. PayPal for, like, all your invoices and contracts and stuff is really cool. The other thing I love is Later. Later is basically your scheduling, scheduler, yes, posting scheduler. So, you can connect your Facebook and your Instagram profiles to Later. And what you do is you create whatever that post may be. You put it on Later, get the caption and it sends it automatically to Instagram or Facebook for you. I love that. The other thing I like is, it's Later, Later, it's another one that I use to organize all of my things.

[00:20:48.610] - Kayla
It is called ClickUp. I'm recently addicted to click up for all my organization. I still keep a handy dandy notebook to write out all of my stuff because I'm a visual learner myself. However, that click up stays on my Internet Explorer all the time, so I reference it often, but those are my main four. So, my first one is PayPal. I love PayPal. The second one that I love is Later for automatic scheduling. The third one that I love is ClickUp for organization, and fourth is my handy dandy notebook.

[00:21:32.530] - Liz, Host
Sure. So, are you primarily communicating with your community via Instagram or Facebook?

[00:21:41.390] - Kayla
Yes. So, we do it through Facebook and Instagram through socials. And of course, emailing. Yeah, I tried to do a slack one time back in the day, but I don't know what happened to the slack. It wasn't as working as much.

[00:21:58.840] - Liz, Host
How to keep up with?

[00:21:59.950] - Liz, Host
Yeah, like, Slack, I feel like was a big thing, especially for online, like, four or five years ago. And it cracks me up when you know the pandemic hit. And a lot of people who work more nine to five jobs, all of them had to work from home, and we're looking at tools. They're like Slack. And I'm like, dude, that was like, four years ago. That's hard to keep up with.

[00:22:20.180] - Kayla
It's hard to keep up with. And not only that when you think about a sense of hand in mind how much people are literally on Instagram all day, on social, all day long. So, it's hard to get people off of Instagram to go to Slack. So, I'm just like, whatever you guys want.

[00:22:39.210] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Meet people where they're at.

[00:22:41.590] - Kayla
Exactly. You have to.

[00:22:44.930] - Liz, Host
If you guys want to learn more from Kayla, I know she, you can always subscribe to stuff on her blog. Do you want to throw out that URL and give some final words?

[00:22:52.860] - Kayla
Definitely. The URL is www.dallasblackbloggers.com or Instagram is also Dallas black bloggers, Facebook and Facebook.com/dallasblackbloggers. Be sure to follow the, join the group. Yeah. There's a lot of big things that I have coming up for 2022. Just more collaborations, more getting bloggers involved with collaborations as well. You know this community was built for the Dallas Black blogger. And so, now that the community has became DBB community, it's not just me. So, I need to make sure, and that's one of my goals too, enhance everybody to make everyone be like me.

[00:23:46.800] - Kayla
I want to come to your events too. I want to sit down at your event and eat your food and drink your liquor, too. I want to come see you in your form, and that's what I'm going to be doing as a place, doing that next year. I'm going to be placing bloggers into certain things so that I can come to their events as well. I don't want to be the one that's one at all. I want to come to their events. That's one of my main goals.

[00:24:10.510] - Kayla
And so, yeah, just make sure you guys follow us, check us out and thank you so much for this.

[00:24:15.830] - Liz, Host
Thank you. I appreciate you being part of this event and sharing your knowledge. I mean community is so important. It really is. Thank you again for sharing how people get started and ideas. I've got some ideas now, and I hope you have a good your day.

[00:24:33.940] - Kayla
Same for you. Thanks.
