Hey, and welcome to my session on how to make money with affiliate marketing the legal way. I'm so excited to be here. This is such a fantastic summit. I've spoken at this summit a couple of years ago and it was amazing. And I'm excited to be spending the next half an hour also with you.

[00:00:30.910] - Lucrezia
So, thank you Liz, for inviting me and thank you all for being here. Now, before we start, I want to ask you a question. Do you promote affiliate products? Do you make money with affiliate marketing? Is affiliate marketing one of your different income streams or strategies?

[00:00:49.380] - Lucrezia
Why am I asking you this? Why? Because affiliate marketing is one of my absolute favorite ways of making money online and it's actually perfect for content creators, bloggers, podcasters, and YouTubers. And the beauty of being an affiliate is the ability to share with your audience, products and services that you love while earning a nice passive.

[00:01:14.650] - Lucrezia
And I emphasize the word passive income while blogging, while creating content. I emphasize the word passive because with affiliate marketing, you can earn money while sleeping, traveling on holiday, or spending time with your loved ones. We know much effort and very minimal work required. You write a blog post or a review or you make a video about it, and you get to earn money from it for years down the track. So, if you're thinking of monetizing your blog, your podcast, or social media accounts, you should definitely look into affiliate marketing.

[00:01:53.620] - Lucrezia
Now, isn't that a dream? Is it too good to be true? Is there a catch? There is no catch, but you can't just promote stuff. You need to follow certain rules.

[00:02:07.690] - Lucrezia
The law is the law. So, yeah, making money with affiliate marketing is amazing, but you need to make sure you meet all the legal requirements. There are a number of different laws that regulate affiliate marketing. In the US, you need to be complying with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines. If you don't comply, you can get fine.

[00:02:25.770] - Lucrezia
But even if you're not based in the US, if you target an international audience, I would still have all the required disclosures to be transparent with your audience and to meet the same legal standard as your audience doesn't necessarily know what laws and regulations apply or don't apply to you, so they might think you're not compliant. So, how can I help you today? Now today, I will walk you through a few steps you can take to make money through affiliate marketing in a way that is legally compliant. But I will go through a lot of information, so get ready to take some notes.

[00:03:04.990] - Lucrezia
Feel free to ask me questions or come back to this session later on to go at your own pace. But make sure you stay till the end because I have a beautiful gift for you. So, let's have a look at what we will cover today. First of all, we will see how you can make money through affiliate marketing legally. We will then see which legal requirements you need to comply with.

[00:03:30.930] - Lucrezia
Once we got this down, we're going to see what you need to include in your content to be legally compliant. And then we will go through the reasons why you must comply with the law. But we will also see how meeting these legal requirements will actually benefit you in so many ways, besides the fact that you will be legally protected. And once we establish that, I will also let you know of a resource that is perfect for you if you want to get rid of all the guesswork and edit and you ask for something that is done for you and ready to go, which is included in the all access pass. And again, I'll remind you, stay till the end because I have a really, really nice gift to share with you.

[00:04:15.910] - Lucrezia
Now, another legal stuff is not the most fun or exciting side of your business. I think Liz will agree. So, I will keep this presentation short and sweet, at least, I'll try. But before we dive in, I will quickly share a little bit about my background.

[00:04:31.530] - Lucrezia
So, for those of you who don't know me, you will learn a bit about my expertise and experience about this topic and we will get to know each other a bit better. So, let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Lucrezia. I'm originally from Italy and I've studied and worked in different countries. When I was in London, I met my husband Sam, who is [inaudible 00:04:53], and we moved together to Melbourne.

[00:04:55.900] - Lucrezia
I've worked as an international lawyer and university lecturer for over 15 years in different countries. And I'm the founder together with my sister Marina of Blogging for New Bloggers, Legal for Business Owners, and Tiny Love Bug and the Blogging for New Bloggers Community, which is a Facebook group with over 36,000 bloggers and other online entrepreneurs from all around the world. I started my business as a creative affiliate because my husband and I, we wanted a baby, but it wasn't happening for us. We tried for almost five years, so I really needed something to keep my mind off our fertility journey. And so at the time, what did I do?

[00:05:38.010] - Lucrezia
I started a blog. So I didn't start my blog as a business venture, but my blog grew more and more every month and now I make over $20,000 from my blog every single month. A big chunk of it comes from affiliate marketing. So, fast forward four years. I'm now a mom.

[00:05:58.300] - Lucrezia
I have a daughter named Violet, she's three years old. And I've used the combination of my research, legal, and business experience to help over 30,000 bloggers, podcasters, coaches, course creators, and other online entrepreneurs just like you to protect their businesses legally with my training and done for you, legal templates. So, I wanted to let you know a bit about my expertise, but at the same time, please keep in mind that I'm a lawyer by profession. I'm not your lawyer. And this presentation does not constitute legal advice.

[00:06:33.640] - Lucrezia
But the information I will be sharing today is for educational purposes only. So, please take a moment to read my legal disclaimer. All right, let's dive in. As I said, the first thing we'll see today is how you can make money with affiliate marketing the legal way. I won't spend much time explaining what affiliate marketing is, because I assume that if you hear them, you most likely know what it is.

[00:06:57.780] - Lucrezia
Or you may already been making money, lots of money, with affiliate marketing. So, there might be some other sessions in the Summit addressing affiliate marketing. So, in a nutshell, affiliate marketing is a process where you earn a commission by promoting other people's or companies' or brands' products and services if the sale is generated through your link of promotional efforts. Basically, there are three parties involved in the process, a merchant or company providing products or services, a customer buying these products or services, and an affiliate that is the middleman, promoting these products or services to potential customers and earning a commission on any sale generated through their promotion. So, you will be the middleman.

[00:07:49.920] - Lucrezia
And the beauty of it is that you don't have to create a product, you don't have to deal with customer service. You just need to recommend the product and you can make commissions. But as I said earlier, although affiliate marketing may almost sound too good to be true. Let's be clear here, it's not as easy as just putting a link within your content and collecting the cash.

[00:08:15.990] - Lucrezia
You are required by law to disclose any personal relationship, compensation, affiliation, or other conflicts of interest that you promote in your context. The Federal Trade Commission, which is basically, you know, the folks in charge of making sure people do business in a fair way, have guidelines in place that regulate affiliate marketing to ensure honesty and transparency. To comply with these guidelines, you need to be upfront and honest about any affiliation you may have with the product or company you are suggesting your audience buys from. In addition to these guidelines, affiliate programs also require the affiliates to disclose something in a specific way. So, it's important to fully read the terms of service of the affiliate program you join before you begin promoting their products.

[00:09:14.980] - Lucrezia
My mind instantly goes to the Amazon Associate program. This can be a very lucrative affiliate program for bloggers and content creators, but their disclosure requirements are very specific. If you do not comply, it's very likely you will be removed from the affiliate program, so. Okay, now I want to give you some actionable tips that you can implement straight away, so that at the end of this session, you can just go and take action to make sure that you have a legitimate disclosure statement. Because actually, that's easier said than done.

[00:09:48.730] - Lucrezia
Many things that just sent this post contain affiliate links is a sufficient disclosure, but it does not cover you legally. Your readers might not know what affiliate links are. So, because this statement is not completely clear to all readers, it does not comply with the pay or trade commission guidelines, and so it can still expose you to the risk of fine. So, let's see how to make your disclosure compliant. First of all, you should have a disclosure statement clearly and conspicuously placed at the top of any sponsored page or post containing any affiliate link.

[00:10:30.870] - Lucrezia
Now, this statement should disclose your financial relationship and compensation if it's the sponsored post, or specify what affiliate links are, and the financial rewards you may obtain through them. You will also want to link from this short statement to your disclosure page, where you should detail your full policy about affiliate links, endorsements, and sponsored posts. The disclosure must be easy to find on the page. The reader should not have to search for it. Your disclosure should also be easy to read, meaning not in a tiny pale font, your audience might not even notice.

[00:11:12.130] - Lucrezia
It should be worded in a way that your average reader will fully comprehend, and it must be located before any affiliate links appear and as close to the link as possible. It needs to be visible on every page of post where affiliate links appear. If you are promoting affiliate links on social media, you need to disclose that too. While social media platforms do have some disclosure policies built in, it's important that you don't just rely on them.

[00:11:47.910] - Lucrezia
You don't need to provide a full disclosure statement, but you do still need to let your followers or subscribers know you have something to gain from the suggestions you're making. Now, as we are limited in seeing the number of characters available on social media posts, the easiest way to discuss affiliations and sponsorship is to use hashtags. You can add affliate, hashtag affiliate link, hashtag affiliate, hashtag sponsored, hashtag ad, all right? You can also simply say this is an affiliate link. But unless your audience is the bloggers, or the creators, influencers, don't shorten the hashtags to something like, hashtag aff, which I see all the time. Other content creators may not know what them, like you know, as we understand what that means, but the average person likely does not know what that means, and you don't want to be deceptive. Alright. Let's recap the big takeaways here.

[00:12:53.950] - Lucrezia
First of all, always, always disclose. Writing an effective disclosure for your blog is essential if you want to use affiliate links. Make sure your disclosure is visible and easy to locate, but also make sure your disclosure is easy to understand. So, remember to include the following information in your disclaimers in your disclosure that you're using affiliate links on your site or within your blog post, what affiliate links are, any material relationship you have with the brands whose products you're promoting, how this would benefit you?

[00:13:29.820] - Lucrezia
For example, you get free products in return, or affiliate commissions, or a bounty on each sale you refer. You may also want to mention how you pick these products that you recommend. Do you use them yourself? Do you test them before recommending them? Explaining all of these will let you build trust with your audience.

[00:13:49.950] - Lucrezia
Include a link to your full disclosure policy page where you can go through everything in detail. Also, in your work as a content creator, as a blogger, you might want to promote products on social media as well, or you might want to start creating ebooks or courses, other resources where it would be useful, or it would make sense to recommend these products as well. Just go for it. But don't forget to add your disclosure there too. Finally, make sure you understand the terms of services of the affiliate programs you join and comply with any specific requirements they might have, or use specific disclosures when applicable.

[00:14:38.110] - Lucrezia
For example, for the Amazon associated program, and so on. All right. These are some actionable tips that you can take right away. You can implement straight away now to start working towards your compliance. And it's great that at the end of this session, you have something practical, actionable that some steps that you can take straight away. And please do it, it's really important.

[00:15:05.830] - Lucrezia
I will tell you a few reasons why you must have these disclosures in place. First of all, obviously, you want to avoid getting a fine. Legal requirements are the law, and so it's not only ethical to comply, it's not only the right thing to do. But also if you're not in compliance, you are breaking the law, which means you can expose yourself to the risk of FT fines by the Federal Trade Commission. And when you're only starting out, even a small fine for a few thousand dollars can set you back and can even you know lead to having to close your blog.

[00:15:42.860] - Lucrezia
But only you should protect your blog legally, you actually want to do so. Because protecting your blog legally comes with so many benefits. It's actually a great opportunity for your blog, for your business. So, there are several benefits in getting your legals in order. You will look legit and trustworthy.

[00:16:04.020] - Lucrezia
You will be accepted into affiliate programs. If you don't have these disclosures in place, you won't be accepted. Most terms of services require that you have disclosures and if you don't, they can kick you out from their affiliate program at any time, so they might not accept you to start with, or even if you're accepted, they might kick you out later on if they find out. You will be seen as established, professional and credible. You will build trust with your audience and convert them into repeat customers.

[00:16:31.380] - Lucrezia
When you are transparent with your audience, when you build trust with them, they will buy from you. People buy from people they trust. You will also be taken seriously by your followers, clients, or potential partnerships and joint ventures, you will run well on Google and another search engine, which is really important to drive traffic to your content. So, you will get peace of mind of being legally protected.

[00:16:58.170] - Lucrezia
You will look legitimate, professional, and it will save you money. It will save you time, save you money, and will open up more opportunity to make more money. Now, just a couple of words on when or where to get your legals in order. Okay, the best thing, the best time to get on top of your legal stuff was yesterday as it's better to have all this stuff set up before you start your blog, before you start writing content or publishing blog posts.

[00:17:29.890] - Lucrezia
But if you haven't done it yet, then the second best time is now. And where to get them? Okay, first of all, stay clear from free legal stuff and like free generators and things like that, they're not complete, they're too generic, they're definitely not comprehensive, and they don't meet all the legal requirements. You won't even know what draft is free template in the first place, so don't rely on those. Another thing you should never do it is copying legal pages and documents from other people's websites. Don't do that.

[00:18:05.590] - Lucrezia
Don't. Just don't. That's copyright infringement. Yes, it applies to legal stuff too. Plus, you don't know what legislation applies to them specifically and whether it is the same that applies to you too.

[00:18:20.110] - Lucrezia
So, it's very risky to rely on those. Not only that, every site offers different services, products, and advice. You need to make sure your policies reflect your site, your location, and its specific needs. So, the best option would be to hire a lawyer, but I understand that this may be a bit probative for many people, as legal fees can adapt to thousands pretty quickly.

[00:18:44.440] - Lucrezia
So, a popular option is to get templates drafted by lawyers. So, if you want the peace of mind that your business is legally compliant, and you won't risk fines at all or if you're not sure how to write your disclosure page. And you don't have the time to figure it out on your own time that you really spend doing what you do best, what can your, so your genius, creating content, engaging with your audience, and growing your blog. So, if you want to get rid of all the guesswork analytics, and you ask for something that is done for you and ready to go, something that make sure you meet all the legal requirements and keep you up to date with future changes in legislation, then I have something perfect for you. You have it, it's my plug and play disclosure template, but the beauty of it is that all the hard work is done for you.

[00:19:33.640] - Lucrezia
You can go through the courses at your own pace or jump straight to the Plug and Play templates, fill them out with your business or blog information and be done in a matter of minutes. These templates are all compliant with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines, but my disclosure template comes with extra bonuses, including special requirements for the Amazon associate programs, how to make your affiliate links not follow in compliance with Google refinement, and so much more. Thousands of creators, bloggers, coaches, podcasters, and other online entrepreneurs have already taken advantage of these templates. And you can be next. I contributed my disclosure templates to the all access pass, so you can have free access to it when you upgrade to the all access pass.

You don't need to register your work for the trademark register it for yours to be, for your work to be yours. But if you have a copyright notice, you will remind everyone that they can't copy, use, or reproduce your work without your consent. So, a copyright notice will lend you more legitimates to your ownership.
