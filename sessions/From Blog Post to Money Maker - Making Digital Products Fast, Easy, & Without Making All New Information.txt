[00:00:13.370] - Tracy
Hey, guys, it's Tracy Lynn.

[00:00:16.090] - Caroline
And Caroline Vencil. And we are here from Blogging Online to help you learn how to take your blog post and make it into a moneymaker. We are all about product creation. We think that it is one of the most integral parts of taking your blog and turning it into a full business is learning how to make product. Okay.

[00:00:37.230] - Tracy
Okay, so let's talk about what our goal is for our talk today. We want to prepare you for making big bucks from your blog and business without doing more work. Because guess what you guys, making products does not have to be hard.

[00:00:56.790] - Caroline
It doesn't. We make it harder than it has to be. But at the end f the day.

[00:00:59.540] - Tracy
Is that the truth?

[00:00:59.700] - Caroline
Yeah, we do this to ourselves and we've done it too. So, we're not immune to it. But we want you to understand, it can be easy.

[00:01:08.440] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:01:09.690] - Caroline
So, we all want our product creation to be sitting on a beach, you're poolside, relaxing, making stuff. And just like watching the money roll in. But in reality, we know that it feels like when you're first starting out screaming at your computer, ripping your hair out, freaking out. We get it. But it doesn't have to be that way. A really important distinction right from the get go that we want you guys to understand is we're bloggers, but at the same time, even bigger than that, this is a business.

[00:01:45.750] - Caroline
This is not just a blog. It's your freaking business. It means that you are going somewhere with this. This isn't just a hobby. This is something that you want to make you money, to be able to pay for your kids' school, retire your husband early, buy a dream house, whatever it is, just live your life and be able to provide for your family. This is a business. It's not a bad thing to say. So, just getting all that out of the way right off the bat.

[00:02:13.180] - Tracy
Okay, so let's talk about some truth bombs. First, a product does not need to be expensive in order for you to turn your blog into an online money making business. And guess what? Like we said, it does not have to be hard to make a product. And we're going to show you the easy way to do it. And the biggest truth that we want to remind you guys of what is easy to you is actually life changing for your readers. So, even though if you come up with an idea you're like, everybody already knows this.

[00:02:46.190] - Tracy
Guess what? They don't.

[00:02:47.830] - Caroline
They don't know it.

[00:02:49.220] - Tracy
And it's your job as a business owner to teach your readers what is common sense to you, so you can make it easy for them. And finally, yes, you can hear me say it. Yes, you can make money from a lower ticket product. You do not need to charge a fortune in order to make a lot of money with your blog. Let me just say, if you have a $7 product and you sell three to four of those products every day, which I think is kind of easy, especially if you have an engaged email list.

[00:03:22.120] - Tracy
You will make close to $8,000 a year from a $7 product.

[00:03:28.120] - Caroline
Just from a $7 product.

[00:03:29.460] - Caroline
And that's like a trip wire product. That's not even like if you promoted it to your list. This is just passive. We're here to teach you. We're not going to be like, oh, you need to have a $9,000 signature course that takes you 18 years and a small fortune to create. No, we want you to understand that these are the things, especially if you're like, I don't know how to make a product. I don't know if it's going to be good. We're here to make it easy for you.

[00:03:53.850] - Caroline
But the truth is, you are not starting from scratch with your product. You are not starting from ground zero at all. You already on your site in your head, everything. It's already there, what you need to make a product on your site right now. You don't have to do any extra work. You're just putting it into a different format.

[00:04:14.680] - Tracy
You're here to show you how to take a blog post that is the foundation of the product that you're going to make and turn it into a money making product. And this process that we use is not only easy, it's fast. So, you don't have to dedicate a month to create a product. You don't have to lock yourself in a hotel room while you're trying to write an ebook. No. It's nothing like that. This is fast, and it's something your readers actually want.

[00:04:40.360] - Caroline
So, but we got ahead of ourselves because we didn't even really introduce ourselves so, we're those crazy chicks who are here to talk to you about product creation. Because Tracy always makes me go first in introducing myself. Hi, I'm Caroline Vencil. I'm the owner of Carolinevencil.com. I started my blog in 2015. So, that officially makes me an Internet dinosaur. I am a full time blogger, mom of four little kids. I used to believe that selling was picky. I said up and down, I never wanted to do it, but here I am now.

[00:05:11.880] - Caroline
My favorite thing in the world to say to people is I make money when I sleep.

[00:05:15.580] - Tracy
And I'm Tracey Lynn, and I'm the blogger at Simple Living Country Gal. I started blogging after Caroline, so in this case, she's actually older than I am. I started in 2016. I'm the mum of four boys and GG of two grand boys, so I'm surrounded by men.

[00:05:34.170] - Caroline
You poor thing.

[00:05:35.200] - Tracy
I know, right? I started out being a revenue chaser. I do not recommend it, but then I turned into creating products, and that is now what I like to call my superpower. That's how I relax. I actually create products. And I love to show other women how to create products that they can then use to explode their businesses just like I did. Then you need to create your own products, guys, chasing ad revenue, especially when Pinterest is in charge of those page numbers coming over to your blog when we first start out with our businesses.

[00:06:07.570] - Tracy
That's not the way to go. It's a roller coaster, and it's stressful, and it is not fun. We want our business to be fun. And if you want to be in control, then you need to create products. And that way you can be in charge of how much money you make and when you want to make it.

[00:06:27.660] - Caroline
We wanted to share with you guys some of our, this is just our perfect product formula is what we call it the BOP perfect formula, which, if you try to say it ten times fast, like.

[00:06:38.570] - Tracy
It's going to hurt your mouth.

[00:06:41.490] - Tracy
It doesn't work.

[00:06:42.190] - Caroline
So, here's how this works. You've already written your blog post. Your blog post that you've already written that you've already created says my readers have this problem and need help fixing it. The product that you create says this is how my readers can take action without trying to figure it out on their own. That is a big distinction. You already know that your people are having a problem because they're on your blog post. They're on your site. They're looking for help. Your product is giving them that help.

[00:07:17.970] - Tracy
We just made the idea of coming up with a product super easy.

[00:07:21.530] - Tracy
Esasy peasy.

[00:07:22.430] - Caroline
Easy peasy. So, here's the way that it works. You're taking your person up this little staircase, you're starting them over here with your blog post. Then you're taking them to your $7 product and then you're taking them to your whatever it is next level, it doesn't have to be a huge jump. It can literally be just stepping stones. But you know that they're on this path because they landed on your blog post.

[00:07:48.820] - Caroline
You're giving them the help that they need in a different container by giving them a product that they can pay for.

[00:07:55.980] - Tracy
Yeah.

[00:07:56.280] - Caroline
So, that's all that it is.

[00:07:57.470] - Tracy
I love this image, this page.

[00:08:01.120] - Caroline
I know. Isn't it fun?

[00:08:02.580] - Tracy
Here's what it is. You guys, the blog post is at the bottom. That's the foundation for everything going forward. That's where everything is already started. You already did the hard work of writing that blog post. Your readers love that blog post, and that way you can take all of that information and transform it into an even more valuable tool that your readers can use. So, I love this.

[00:08:26.850] - Caroline
So, don't freak out because we know that we just threw a lot of information at you and you're like, I still don't even think I want to make a product. The good. I'm reading your,  Tracy, sorry.

[00:08:35.340] - Tracy
It's okay. Keep on.

[00:08:35.930] - Caroline
Time, come it.

[00:08:39.390] - Tracy
Not that one. This is mine.

[00:08:39.720] - Caroline
I'm sorry. I'm trying to kick a cat away.

[00:08:41.930] - Tracy
This is us.

[00:08:43.120] - Tracy
Go for it.

[00:08:44.390] - Caroline
Sorry. I love you. Please don't fire me. I was looking at a cat who I think is going to start jumping at my face. So, if you see a cat, wait, maybe he's going downstairs.

[00:08:54.810] - Caroline
Okay, this is real life guys.

[00:08:57.020] - Tracy
She's the person that's attacking her, and.

[00:08:58.340] - Caroline
I love her.

[00:08:59.600] - Tracy
Storm right outside my window.

[00:09:01.110] - Caroline
No, don't tell me that, you're recording.

[00:09:03.420] - Tracy
I know.

[00:09:04.280] - Caroline
It can't be a severe thunderstorm. Okay, the good news is you already have the content that you need to make your whole product on your blog. It's right there.

[00:09:17.680] - Tracy
It's right there. Ready to go. Don't make it hard, you guys.

[00:09:22.770] - Caroline
I'm going to have you do this one because I already took your site. I'm very sorry. Please don't fire me.

[00:09:27.150] - Tracy
Just keep going.

[00:09:28.300] - Caroline
Okay. So, we start with, like, everything that we just said. You remember the little going up the stairs. Everything starts with your top blog posts. This is where we find out where our readers are coming from. You can do this from Google Analytics or Pinterest or wherever it is that you find out where your traffic is coming from. So, this is to help you understand where to start your energy and your focus so that you aren't wasting your time. There's nothing worse than trying to be like.

[00:09:57.430] - Tracy
It's like that blog post that you're like, oh, my gosh. This is so good, and nobody reads it and you're like, well, there goes all my time and energy. We don't want that to happen to you when it comes to making a product. Start off with the ones that are bringing in the most traffic, because that's what your audience is already looking for.

[00:10:15.950] - Tracy
And I think that's an important point to make, because if your audience is already at the blog post, that's solving a problem for them. When you turn that blog post into a product, the audience is already there.

[00:10:28.610] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:10:28.860] - Tracy
They're just tapping their fingers on the table, waiting for you to come up with the next step. So, when you can ride the coat tails of a popular blog post, it's like selling something to an audience that is ready and waiting for you. So, yeah.

[00:10:42.750] - Caroline
It's so true. It works, too.

[00:10:46.230] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:10:46.560] - Caroline
Let's see. Are you going to like me today? No. Okay. There we go. Now, it does.

[00:10:50.980] - Caroline
Okay.

[00:10:52.050] - Caroline
And then we create the product for that. Whatever that next step is after your blog post, that is your product. That's it. It's really that simple.

[00:11:05.530] - Tracy
Yeah. So, it's problem, blog post, next step, product. That's all it is, you guys. And I think Caroline and I were talking about this before we filmed. I think we just have this mentality of thinking it needs to be hard, because the word product is sort of a scary word, especially when you're new to doing this.

[00:11:26.400] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:11:27.190] - Tracy
I think we have it in our heads that it needs to be life altering. It needs to change the world. It needs to solve all the problems in society in order for it to be a valuable tool. And it does make you guys. Your readers are just looking for the next step. So, don't make it harder. Keep it easy, not only for you, but for your readers as well.

[00:11:48.690] - Caroline
Yes. And it doesn't have to be. And this is the big thing for me was realizing that there's a lot of product levels that you can get to before you have $1,000 course.

[00:12:00.920] - Tracy
Right.

[00:12:01.450] - Caroline
And in my head, it's like, well, I don't have enough content to make $1,000 course yet, so I guess I just can't make any product.

[00:12:09.100] - Tracy
Yeah, that's not true.

[00:12:11.020] - Caroline
That's not the truth.

[00:12:11.400] - Caroline
It's not the actual truth. It's how we feel.

[00:12:15.510] - Tracy
How we feel.

[00:12:15.840] - Caroline
But in reality, people need to have that lower level product before they're willing a lot of times to go straight in and buy a big $1,000 horse. Like you can't just go straight like from playing around like doggy paddle in the shallow end to going off the high dive. That's not how we want our people to be. We got to give them those steps to get in there. So, this is where the fun part happens. Guys, we're going to be dishing on our, it's three, but it's technically four favorite things that we can do.

[00:12:48.080] - Tracy
Let's just go for it and say it's four.

[00:12:49.670] - Caroline
We're going to call it four, even though technically we just called it a bonus, but we're going to go for it.

[00:12:54.180] - Tracy
Okay. So, Caroline and I love to give practical examples so you can really take action. So, we're not hearing people. We're all about giving you actionable things. So, we're actually going to give you four product ideas that you can literally start creating as soon as you're done watching this slide show. Product idea number one is to take your blog post content and use it to create a guide or a binder. A binder is like the buzzword right now. People love binders, so you could take it, turn it into a binder.

[00:13:28.510] - Tracy
We kind of have different parts that we put in a binder, and it all starts with a cover, and then you want to add an intro. Now, when we say intro, what we mean is the steps in written form of how to use the product that your people bought. And the reason why an intro is so important is because sometimes people buy products quickly, but don't use them right away. So, if they buy a product and it's just the pages of the product, they're probably going to say in their heads, why did I get this?

[00:13:58.440] - Tracy
Why is this? Why did I spend money on this? And the intro reminds them what it was, why it's so amazing how they can use it to take the next step to solving the problem your blog post wrote about and why it's going to transform them and fix the issue they're struggling with. Then you want to add in a breakdown of each step that you wrote about in your blog post, going into a bit more detail. Then you can add in checklists. You can add in a filled out checklist, a blank checklist that they can customize.

[00:14:32.990] - Tracy
You can add bonus tips. You can have a shortcut sheet. You can have a calendar, planner pages, whatever you need to round out that binder. Keeping always in your mind what your blog post was about. It needs to relate to that blog post, so it's the next natural step for your readers when they're reading your blog. That post.

[00:14:53.940] - Caroline
I love that. And here's the fun thing if you're like, I don't know how to make a binder. You've already inside of your blog post whether it's like the ten things that you need to blank, you're still giving them the steps. Now you're giving it to them in a form that they'll be able to take and put it into action. That's the whole thing. You've already written the words, copy and paste those words. Copy and paste the words that you've already used. Give them a blank space underneath of it, so they can fill it out.

[00:15:24.810] - Tracy
That's it. That's it. That's it.

[00:15:26.030] - Caroline
And you're not coming up with it from scratch. And you don't have to feel bad that you've already written the words in a different place. You're giving it to them in a place that they're able to take action from it and not just absorb the content but actually do something about it.

[00:15:40.710] - Caroline
Number two.

[00:15:41.830] - Tracy
Product idea number two, create an interactive workbook. So, this was something else Caroline and I talked about because sometimes workbooks scare people, but if you use the word interactive, it makes it more of a you and them collaboration on the product. So, again, you're going to start with the cover. Again, you're going to have a written intro of what the workbook is and why it is so amazing. And then you're going to break down each step that you wrote about in your blog post in a QnA format form.

[00:16:13.650] - Tracy
This allows your reader to be your partner in your blog post, and it allows them to put their own thoughts down on paper and mingle them with yours, creating a really valuable tool for whatever it is you wrote about in your blog post. And you want to include pages for notes and journaling you want to add in planner pages again, a calendar. You can add in the same pages we talked about in product number one, checklist, and blank checklist and filled out one. You make the rules because these are your products.

[00:16:45.280] - Tracy
We're just giving you an idea of where to start. How deep you go. All depends on you.

[00:16:53.590] - Caroline
It doesn't have to be hard, guys. It can be as simple or as big as you make them. And here's something else really quick about workbooks. We've seen workbooks that started, like ten pages, and we've seen them go up to more than 300. Like there is no limit. There is no like right number for any of those like workbooks or binders like you make the rule.

[00:17:14.220] - Tracy
No one knows your people but you, so we can't set a limit on things. You know, if they're going to get overwhelmed by 300 pages and you know, if they're going to get frustrated because you only had to.

[00:17:25.330] - Caroline
Yes. Oh, that's so good. Okay, sorry. Number three, this is my favorite thing in the world to do. This is my absolute favorite thing in the entire world to do. And I am not kidding. You're reading this and you're going, no way. Yes, way. I sell these every single time I run a sale on my own shop. I make $1,500 in a weekend. This is printing money. Okay, so that's my preface by saying literally, take your blog post, copy and paste it into a Google Doc, which is free or a word Doc if you so chose.

[00:18:02.140] - Caroline
And make it into an ebook, literally make it into an ebook. Get rid of any of the awesome boxes. Make sure that your photos make sense in that context. Use your most popular Pin as a cover for your.

[00:18:21.670] - Tracy
That's a fact.

[00:18:21.960] - Caroline
I thank you so much. For your ebook, add in page numbers, give it a copyright at the bottom. Boom. That's it.

[00:18:29.800] - Caroline
You got it.

[00:18:31.000] - Tracy
That is literally it. When she first told me this, I'm like, Nah, I sell them now too. And people buy them.

[00:18:39.400] - Caroline
I have been selling these since 2016 because I was afraid, this is full story. I was afraid that if I sold anything that people would be like, oh, that's icky. So, I'm like, this is the easiest thing that I can think of.

[00:18:55.840] - Tracy
Literally.

[00:18:56.390] - Caroline
Anyway.

[00:18:58.330] - Tracy
Sorry, guys, we had to check out for tech issues, but we're back.

[00:19:02.380] - Caroline
Okay.

[00:19:05.510] - Tracy
So, Caroline, what are your problems?

[00:19:06.490] - Caroline
Anyway, so, hang on. What?

[00:19:09.110] - Caroline
Okay. Okay, sorry. There was a child who poked his head in the door. Anyway, I was afraid that this was going to be too difficult, so I just started making these and I literally listed them for sale on my blog. And I'm like, no one is going to buy these. No one's going to buy these. I'm going to get yelled at because I literally took my blog post and made it into a different format. I literally took my blog post, copied and pasted it into Word and made it a PDF.

[00:19:37.910] - Caroline
Somebody's going to know. Here's the reality. I've been selling these things where it's now.

[00:19:43.280] - Caroline
Oh, my gosh.

[00:19:44.010] - Caroline
Is it five years? Was 2016 five years? Holy cow.

[00:19:48.590] - Tracy
Five years. Five years.

[00:19:50.310] - Caroline
I've been selling these for five years. I have never once gotten a complaint on these.

[00:19:57.410] - Tracy
And that is just telling what we said earlier. What is common sense to you is life changing to them?

[00:20:05.750] - Caroline
Life changing.

[00:20:07.730] - Tracy
Just because it's easy for you to create doesn't mean it's not going to be a valuable resource for your readers. So, I think we need to give ourselves a little grace, allow us to think of things more on our readers level and create what it is they're looking for, guys. That's it. Just create what you want.

[00:20:29.030] - Caroline
Oh, yeah. And just back to the whole concept of what is so intrude level, like, to us, like, Duh, doesn't everybody know how to do that? No, they don't.

[00:20:39.780] - Caroline
They don't.

[00:20:40.230] - Caroline
Tracy has shared truth bombs with me about organizing, and I'm like, I never thought about that in a million years. I share things about, like, budgeting. But to me, it's like, Duh, doesn't everybody do this? That's my primary niche is talking to women about money who don't know how to handle money. And I'm like, Duh, doesn't everybody do? No, they don't. And the second that you realize that, the second that you realize that what you've just been doing, like, muscle memory is a game changer for other people. That's when you can start to unlock the potential for your product creation, that's where it comes in.

[00:21:19.340] - Tracy
Oh, I love it.

[00:21:19.850] - Caroline
Thank you. That was a really good one. Okay, but we're not done yet.

[00:21:23.930] - Tracy
One more page.

[00:21:27.350] - Caroline
This is honestly one of our big things because we were like, do we really want to go a little bit next level?

[00:21:35.150] - Tracy
Guys, don't freak out when we say the V word. Please don't freak out.

[00:21:37.300] - Caroline
Please don't freak out when you hear the V word, and we all know what that is.

[00:21:40.690] - Tracy
It's video. It's video

[00:21:42.530] - Caroline
Here, whether we like it or not. Video is, in fact, something that is becoming more and more important for our businesses.

[00:21:52.130] - Tracy
Your people who see you and hear you.

[00:21:55.790] - Caroline
But here's kind of the bonus too of this bonus tip.

[00:21:59.240] - Caroline
You're taking your blog post and using it essentially as a script for a video.

[00:22:06.600] - Tracy
I know, right?

[00:22:08.570] - Caroline
It can literally be if you wanted to do it over a PowerPoint presentation without showing your face. If you want to show your face and just stand there like a talking head is what my I'm told that those videos are called, it's just you sitting there. However you want to do it, you can make that video using your blog post as a script, using that workbook or those planner pages or that binder that you've made in previous products, using that as an add on. And now you have an e course.

[00:22:42.490] - Tracy
An e course, you guys. Oh, my gosh. It literally is that simple. You're just going to add a video onto one of the product ideas we just mentioned. Add in a few extra bonuses, just like that. You have an E course. That's your double dollar signed product the next level up. And again, it's really that easy.

[00:23:01.880] - Caroline
Yeah. We make things a lot harder for ourselves when we come up with this idea of, like, well, if I do a video, then I have to have X, Y and Z kind of like, I need to have a DSLR camera and a lighting setup and a teleprompter. No. No. No.

[00:23:19.970] - Tracy
A lot of my videos are PowerPoints. People love PowerPoints. They like to read and see at the same time. So, PowerPoints are a great way to start.

[00:23:30.250] - Caroline
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

[00:23:31.100] - Tracy
They really are.

[00:23:31.790] - Caroline
And by the way, your webcam on your computer or on your phone, your phone camera is perfectly fine.

[00:23:38.860] - Caroline
It's fine.

[00:23:40.080] - Caroline
You don't have to stress out.

[00:23:41.620] - Tracy
No.

[00:23:42.590] - Caroline
But here's kind of the fun part about doing this is you can make this into a big E course or a small one, and you can elaborate on your points that you said so that instead of doing you know ten tips in five minutes, you have ten different mini videos.

[00:24:01.370] - Tracy
Guys, did you hear what she just said?

[00:24:03.380] - Caroline
Now you have a big course.

[00:24:04.960] - Tracy
Now you have a big course.

[00:24:06.340] - Caroline
Now you have a big course.

[00:24:07.780] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:24:08.180] - Caroline
And this is all, by the way, we've come up with all of these different products, starting with a single blog post.

[00:24:17.170] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:24:18.230] - Caroline
We're not talking about going and finding more things all over your blog or even having to you know come up with brand new ideas or brand new concepts that you haven't already written down in some way, shape or form. It's all there.

[00:24:30.790] - Tracy
All done for you, ready to go. The hard work is the blog post. The product creation is easy.

[00:24:38.270] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:24:39.010] - Tracy
So, there you go.

[00:24:39.700] - Caroline
That's true. And you have to let it be easy in order for it to be easy. So, we've already said this before.

[00:24:46.930] - Tracy
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:24:47.760] - Caroline
No, you go ahead and say it because I'm looking at the corner. Now I'm like I did it again.

[00:24:51.940] - Tracy
We have a system. We just don't always pay attention to it. Okay, guys.

[00:24:55.580] - Caroline
We? Yo, I don't pay attention to it. Okay. Anyway, continue.

[00:24:59.260] - Tracy
Alright. Your people want things easy, and they want to pay you for your knowledge. There is nothing wrong with asking someone to pay you for what you know, guys, this is a business. This is not a hobby. That is way back in 2014, 2015. Now, this is a business. And the quicker you put your mindset on that you are a business owner, and this is a business that you're running to support you and your family with, the easier it's going to be to implement all of those money making resources on your blog.

[00:25:33.290] - Caroline
Yeah, there it is.

[00:25:36.410] - Tracy
And there's the thunder.

[00:25:38.100] - Caroline
Oh, no. Well, I didn't hear the thunder. I'm trying to see if it's going to go to the next page. Okay. But here's the thing that we've both encountered in our own lives, and we know that you're probably thinking it too. Making product has to be hard, right?

[00:25:52.950] - Tracy
Yeah. Even though we give you examples, you're probably still thinking. Oh, yeah, it sounds good in theory. But how do you actually make it work?

[00:26:00.490] - Caroline
So, we made an example for you. Go to the next slide.

[00:26:05.100] - Tracy
Go to the next slide.

[00:26:05.260] - Caroline
There we go. So, meet Lacey T, bearing in no resemblance to anybody who we know.

We believe it.
