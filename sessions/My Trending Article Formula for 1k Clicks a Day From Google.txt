Hey, everybody. My name is Nina Clapperton, and I'm here to teach you about my trending article formula to get you 1,000 clicks in a day from Google. Now, who am I? If you don't know me, hi, my name is Nina. I'm the founder of sheknowseo.co, which is an SEO company that helps bloggers like you rank on Google. I'm Canadian, so you might hear some abouts and some stories, and you'll see my puppy Theo throughout. He's a lot cuter than any of the screenshots I take, so I'm including him to keep your attention. Now, I am obsessed with SEO and AI. I am honestly addicted to it. And because of that, I use my knowledge, my skills, and my hyper fixations to make sure that you are growing your business and ranking on Google. Now, I like to show you immediately that I know what I'm talking about. Now, Now, back in May of 2024, the Google algorithm leaked and I wrote an article that went viral. It got over, I think it was over 26,000. It was on the screen. It got over 26,000 clicks in that month. It also made me almost $1,000 just in ad revenue, and then honestly, far, far more when it came from affiliates and products down the line.

[00:01:21.320] - Nina Clapperton
So this is the article. It's the Google algorithm leak. You can see here it got 26,780 clicks in the 30-day period. That was from May 27th to June 27th. And then my Raptive earnings, you can see here, I made $821 in ad revenue, and that's not including affiliate links, the digital products I went on to sell, and the multiple sponsored deals I got out of it. I would say this article paid for itself 5,000 times over, especially since it didn't cost me anything to write. So highly recommend. And this isn't just a flash in the pan. I've done it again. So before I did this training, I wanted to make sure that you all could see a more recent example since I know that Google's algorithm has been changing a lot. This is the exact same site. I wrote an article about a new AI tool, and it took off, and I got a thousand clicks in a single day. Now, the best part of this is this is not a good SEO post otherwise. It has no backlinks. I forgot to add any internal links to either of these. I made a lot of mistakes with the setup of them.

[00:02:25.390] - Nina Clapperton
The keyword didn't technically exist yet because it was a new topic. Technically, everything I did was anti-SEO. There was no volume, there was no competitor analysis done, none of that fancy keyword research stuff, which I do also love, but I think there's a time and a place to break some rules. You're probably like, What the heck is that? How did you do it? Is it magic? No. It's my trending topic formula. I have repeated this on a number of sites. I have over 12 niche sites that I run now. I have done it on everything from to dogs, to recipes, to construction, to travel. It literally works no matter the niche that you're in, and that's what makes it so cool. So I have the steps that we're going to go through here together. Step one, we're going to find the topics because you're not a journalist. You don't need to go out and hunt this down. Step two, we're going to do our own research and analysis to add our own flair to it. Then step three, we are going to add something new to the conversation. We're going to go a step further.

[00:03:26.610] - Nina Clapperton
Step four, we're going to write an epic article, and I'll tell you exactly what that and what it should be in that article. Step five, we are going to turn our visitors into fans. As you notice from my screenshots, this is something that brings a lot of traffic, but it's for a short period, and we want to make sure we are keeping that audience. So I'm going to show you how I was able to get this article into... I don't even know. Honestly, I didn't have good tracking set up, but my email list grew by a couple thousand people pretty quickly around that period. So I can safely say at least bare minimum, 500 people came from that article. I suspect it was a lot more. Then we have step six, which is to share it everywhere. And I'm going to help you repurpose your content to other places with an automated system I have set up. And then lastly, we are going to fully repurpose it, not just quoting it. We are going to recreate new things around it to keep this traction going. So I do want to give some caveats to begin with because a strategy like this can turn into fool's gold very quickly if you are doing some things wrong with it.

[00:04:30.690] - Nina Clapperton
So number one, there are no guarantees here. The first thing people always ask me is, how can I be sure if it's a trending topic? You can't. You have no idea. Just like with something going viral on TikTok or Instagram, what goes viral, quote unquote, with this, and this isn't really a virality thing, it's going to depend. And so I have written a lot of articles that didn't take off, and then I've written some that did take off. Now, taking off also varies. It's not always going to be 30,000 clicks in a month. It might be that it gets you 500 clicks. It might be that it gets you 50. It really depends on the post, how popular it is, how big your niche is, and ultimately, some of it's luck. So I'm going to teach you the steps to make this possible, but I cannot guarantee that every single article is going to kick off. At this point, when I publish these articles, I have an over 50 % success rate. I haven't done perfect math on it, but roughly, I can say in the last four months, it has been over 75%.

[00:05:32.660] - Nina Clapperton
But a lot of that has come from repetition and writing a lot of posts that didn't do that well. Now, the next thing is, don't like engagement bait. Don't just be posting about any news source. You are not like CNN. You are not like as some news network. You are a blogger. That is very different. So you're not going to be out here like breaking news journalism for the first time. And you're also not trying to report on everything. We want to choose things that are specific to our audience and to our niche. That way, even if it didn't take off, it would still be relevant to them. So it can still live on your site and it won't look bizarre. And then lastly, quality is key. I see a lot of people see me have success with this and then go, Oh, I'm going to do the same, but I'm going to publish a 200-word article and I'll do a thousand of them. No, that's not the point of this. I think that this is a great strategy to grow your business, and you could definitely be doing it more often. I would say absolute maximum once a week because partially, you need to give your audience a cool down period in between.

[00:06:36.720] - Nina Clapperton
But also these articles take time to write. They are not like a quick, I don't know, tell ChatGPT, write a trending article about Moo Deng or something or about Chappell Roan, you need to actually go in and add more to this. So quality is going to matter so much. So first one, we are going to find trending topics together. So how do we find these trending topics? Well, the first thing you're going to need is a clearly defined niche. You just need to know what you're working with. So let's say we're working with dogs. We're using the example of my dog throughout this. So here's Theo. He's on a hotel bed with me when we were working as we were traveling. He wants to look for some trending topics around dog content, maybe dog travel because he's in a bed. I need to know who I'm speaking to. If my audience have a Chihuahua versus a large dog, it's very different. If they're located in Asia versus in the US, also quite different. So I need to know that. And now to find those trending topics, the easiest thing is to live in your niche. And what I mean by that is just actually enjoy the content and be on TikTok and have it be something your algorithm naturally feeds you.

[00:07:45.080] - Nina Clapperton
Be on Twitter, have it be something that algorithm naturally feeds you. So already have a passion for this subject. And I totally get you want to turn it off when you're off work hours, that's fine. But you do want to be living in the niche, hearing what's going on and having the news come to you long term. So here's where I find topics. I'll move my little head. The first is Google Trends. Now, Pinterest Trends is also a good one, but they're basically the same from what I've seen. So I use Google Trends. Now, you can also use it via Key Search. Key Search, you can get 30% off with code She Know's SEO if you want it. But they actually have a Google Trends feature as well as a Twitter Trends feature so that you can actually do it all from inside of Key Search, which is nice. But I will use Google and I'll see what's trending. Twitter, just being on Twitter and seeing what people post about, that's how I found out about the Google algorithm leak. I've been to conferences before and heard about things that I was like, Oh, I should look into that.

[00:08:42.770] - Nina Clapperton
Going on general news sites, signing up to any press release that's really big in the cruise world is being on press releases. If you do anything with like lodging or hotels, hotels have PR. There are so many different things you can get on there. Any industry-specific news sources. Tiktok, love TikTok for it. You can get on the ground journalism really, really fast, and it's very easy to train the algorithm to show you that. Then Exploding Topics. It's a paid site, but I just get their free email. And so once a week, they send you a few topics that are exploding or taking off. And so those are things that recently have had a ton of traffic. So they had things like hair gummies when those first came out. They had ChatGPT when it first hit. So I've been on their list for a while, as you can tell. But that's a really great way to get a couple delivered to your email. They do have a paid one, but I can't speak to it. And then lastly, your own communities. I'm a big fan of having a Facebook group or some exclusive community for your audience.

[00:09:41.660] - Nina Clapperton
And that can be a great place where people, again, bring it to you. Now, number two is to do your own research and analysis. So when we're doing this, we don't just want to be parroting what anyone else has said. You're not a parrot. You are your own person. You have your own opinions and thoughts. And your audience wants to hear from you. So they want you to do the critical analysis and research for them. So let's say that we found out that Bark Air opened. They did back in 2024. Let's say they've announced a new route from Toronto to Australia. I don't know. So with that, I'm like, Okay, now I've heard that news is happening, but I want to look into this. Maybe I want to compare it to what other options are available. Maybe I want to speak to some people who actually flew with them already if they've done an inaugural flight or for any of their other flights. Maybe I want to compare the quality of the plane that they're flying versus other ones. There have been some lawsuits in that niche. So all of that is extra context I can add to this to help my audience decide if this is something that solves their pain points.

[00:10:44.620] - Nina Clapperton
So I want you to think about, Okay, what is it that I can bring my expertise to? What are some other questions people might have? How can I add to this conversation? And please, please, please do not just read an analysis of an analysis of an analysis of a summary of an analysis. Go to the original source as best you can to try and actually get the information. And then with that as well, if you're not an expert for anything dog-related, I am not a vet or a trainer, I can go out and seek expert sources and get their comments and opinions on it. Think about how many people do those people on the street interviews with the little baby mics right now. Those are really common because they're getting opinions from real human beings on the subject. You can also compare and contrast some stats that you can find online. Most things are available out there for free. You can get a lot of Freedom of Information Act reports, but most people just put their statistics up. In Canada, we have Statistics Canada. You can find so much there. We always, always, always, sorry, I already said this earlier, but that's how important it is.

[00:11:47.130] - Nina Clapperton
Read the original. You don't want to misquote something. You don't want to misrepresent something. And also, I find by reading the original, you're likely to think like your ideal audience. When I was reading the Google algorithm leak documents, there were over 14,000 algorithm elements leaked. It was so boring. And as I was reading it, I was like, wow, my audience does not care about this. They just want to know what if this matters to them? What if this will actually affect their lives? And so that leads us to steps Three, add something new. Now, when you're adding something new, basically the easiest way to think of it is to ask yourself, so what? Why does my audience need to know this? If I explain to them that this thing happened and they said, so what? How would How would I answer them? How would I say that this is why it matters to you? And the best way to think of that, the easiest thing, is to figure out their main pain point. You can even ask ChatGPT this, Hey, my audience is this type of person. This is their primary pain point. I want to write an article on this thing that's happening right now.

[00:12:47.990] - Nina Clapperton
How can I write it and address it towards their pain point? Easy peasy. There could be a few different ways that this happens. It might be that you're taking complex text speak and turning it into English. You could be creating action steps. For that algorithm leak, I did both. I said what to do next. Here's what it means for bloggers. I actually outranked all the people who did the leaking, which was partially a Google thing. But the reason that I was able to do that is because I went a step further. I added something new, and I think the amount of people parroting the original actually made the original look like spam, unfortunately. And you don't want to get caught up in that. It looks like duplicate content. Then you can add in personal experience. You compare it with the past experience you had, bring in some new discussion point. How many times have we seen Instagram and TikTok videos where it's like, I haven't seen anyone talking about this yet. It's a good hook for a reason. You can do long term analysis of how something has played out over time. You can compare and contrast that, or you can predict the future and think about what that's going to do for you next.

[00:13:51.840] - Nina Clapperton
Now we need to write that epic article. First rule, don't write like BuzzFeed. Buzzfeed is great for quizzes. They are not great for content, and they are a news site. They are like an entertainment news site. We need an actual helpful article because our goal is that if someone is visiting us for this, we're representing our brand so they know what they're going to get if they stick around. If this is like very thin content, that's what they're going to expect from the rest of your site. And they're likely not going to stick around because they're not going to give you that chance to figure out that you actually write great stuff. Here's what a quality article includes to me. Number one, an introduction to the topic. This is new. This is trending trending. They don't know what this trend is. You have to explain it. You also need to clearly say why you are the person to talk about it. These people largely will not know you yet. This is basically meant to reach a new audience. So we need to intro ourselves. Pitch yourself in one to two sentences. I'm Nina. I've had articles that have hit 30,000 page views in 35 days and made me a $1,000 in ad revenue or whatever.

[00:14:55.610] - Nina Clapperton
That's going to convince someone to read my article about that thing. So we want to have You also want to speak to your target audience. So again, we're writing for our niche. But when I'm talking about Bark Air, I'm not going to talk about it for Chihuahua's if I have my beautiful, lovely, giant ass golden retriever over here. I'm going to talk about it in the sphere of large dog travel because he's huge. So I don't have the audience who would want the other thing. They're typically long form. So over a thousand words. I'd say my shortest I've ever managed to have work was 800, but it does depend on the topic for sure. However, the fact that you're adding something new should immediately make it very easy to get to a thousand words. Get to the point. Cut the fluff. I spend a long time cutting the fluff out of my articles and getting straight to the point. Here's exactly what you need to know, especially because this is a trend that's going to likely grow, and then you have to compete with the people who come later. You need to tell them why this matters to them and what to do.

[00:15:53.890] - Nina Clapperton
Action is very much key. People don't want to just be told, Here's how to add one plus one. They're like, Okay, When, why, how? Exactly walk me through it. Let's have real life. They want all the extra details. Then it's going to conclude. Don't leave them with SEO blue balls where it's like you just end, leave them hanging halfway through an article. I have seen it so many times. Instead, finish the post and then tell them a little bit more. So add on a relevant strategy that they can do with this information. Have a next step, something that they should read. Have some way that this article connects to the larger idea of your and your niche and plant some seeds about why they would need you in their life. And then we want to turn those visitors into fans. So these are some ways I keep people coming back for more with my articles. I have an email list often in every single one, and especially in these ones. In these ones, I add it 2-3 times, bare minimum. Then you can have them come to your community to ask questions. So I always say, Hey, join my Facebook group to ask questions.

[00:16:56.200] - Nina Clapperton
It's because I'm really bad at email, but it's helped grow my Facebook group. You could create a hashtag on social media that they can share things to. Let's say it's this bark-air thing. Maybe you want to have people share photos of their dogs flying. That'd be very cute. You can promote a low-ticket offer inside the piece. I don't recommend going to be having high ticket just because these people don't know you yet. You need to bring them into your sphere and having a very low barrier to entry is better. You're going to add internal links to other content on your site, and you could even invite them to a limited time live webinar or live event. And then we're going to share this everywhere. So the Google algorithm leak actually revealed to us that Google cares about clicks from social media from other places. On Chrome, they're tracking how people move through the web. So they want to know that people are getting to you, not just through Google. Google is a popular girl. Once you get other people talking about you, then she'll care about you. So we want to try and get some social clicks.

[00:17:53.790] - Nina Clapperton
Newsletter is a huge one for that. Social media is also good. Really, whatever you can do to make you seem more desirable is going to make Google desire you more. So where can you share this? I'm going to move my head because it's in front of the QR code, but you can share it to any of your social media accounts. On Instagram, I use many chat to share my algorithm leak article, and that did really well. Well, really well for me. I don't have a good Instagram, but the biggest thing for me was emailing it to my list. That got about a thousand clicks, and that really triggered everything else to go off. Now, for how to share these in an easy and automated way, I have a Zapier connection section that I set up with the OpenAI API, which is like pennies. It's not expensive. And here's a tutorial on exactly how to do that. It's a free tutorial. Go watch it. It'll show you exactly the way to set this up. So it runs on autopilot. And then lastly, we need to repurpose our content. So when you're creating this content, you want to make sure that you are thinking about how to make the most of it.

[00:18:52.180] - Nina Clapperton
So the first thing to consider is, can you put this trend on another platform? These trending topics aren't a TikTok trend like GirlMath something, which even then, honestly, spilled over everywhere. But this is information that's new to all of these platforms. So I also recorded a video that was me rambling, to be honest. It was too long, but about the Google algorithm leak and a couple of little extra details I hadn't been able to fit in the article. I was also able to interact with my audience about it so I could answer some questions. It got 1,200 views. Now, my YouTube is not massive, so that's really big for something that I had streamed five days ago the time I took this. It usually takes a long time for my stuff to take off because I SEO it, I don't YouTube it. So turn your content into a video, a podcast, a live webinar. Clip it for social media. There are so many things you can do to keep them coming back or join you in other spaces. You can even turn this into a series. With the Google algorithm leak, people were unveiling five things a day for months about, Oh, now we've discovered this.

[00:19:55.670] - Nina Clapperton
So just keep juicing that lime until it's fully run dry. Now, I have a challenge for you. I am one of those teachers that likes to give homework, but it's very easy homework. Theo and I want you to write a trending topic this week. We want you to follow the seven easy steps, and then I want you to let me know how it goes. And if you tag me in it this week or next, I'll give you two weeks, I will be one of your social clicks. So share it @NinaClapperton on basically every social platform, and I will find it, I will click, and I will make sure to help that algorithm trigger that it should look at your article. So remember, though, they won't all be winners. So you might need to do this a couple of times. And that's okay. It's going to help you get to know your audience and help them learn that you are staying on the pulse in this industry. And honestly, they're going to trust you more for it. But how would you like to see your blog reaching these heights consistently? Because 1,000 clicks a day is nice, but it's not going to get you into an ad network.

[00:20:52.160] - Nina Clapperton
It's not going to make you consistent money. Well, you can do it the hard way. You can spend five years working hard, have no income. You can jump from TikTok to Pinterest to SEO to Instagram and back. You could wait six months for your articles to rank on Google. You could spend over $12,000 on blogging courses. And honestly, I think at this point, I'm well into $30k now. It's become a problem. But now they're for fun. But on courses that still don't get you results. And those first $12K, they didn't. You could spend more time at webinars and summits, but you can spend more time at webinars and summits and master classes and have nothing to show for it because you haven't actually written anything. Or you can do things the easy way and join me in 6 Months to 50K. This is my 6 Months to 50K sessions masterclass. It's going to show you the exact steps I take to grow to 50,000 sessions and get into Mediavine with a new site. Now, this also includes site setup. So there is a bonus month of setting up your website with tech and getting your tech all sorted.

[00:21:55.300] - Nina Clapperton
I'll teach you my batchwork system to produce content more productively. Getting too excited. And you'll get two recorded blog audits that I did for past students that show you exactly how to structure your site and write posts that rank while showing you what not to do, because I think that that's a very helpful visual. Now, for the next two weeks, you can get this for 50 % off, but this is limited time. You can use the QR code on screen. You can go to the link on the side. It's going to auto-apply the coupon. If either of them glitch for some reason, it is BBS for Blogger Breakthrough Summit, 25. And you will be able to get 50 % off. Let's talk about what's actually inside of it, though. You're going to get that month zero. You're going to learn how to define your niche and audit your site. You'll figure out how to do keyword research the right way, how to write posts that actually rank and that people want to read, how to get back links without buying them, how to intentionally internal link to keep people on your site and turn them really into best friends.

[00:22:54.930] - Nina Clapperton
And then my zero to hero keyword strategy that is a very underrated method to to grow your blog by going for these special types of keywords that I grew by over 10,000 page views in a month from them. Then we'll talk about how to track your success with some tracking tools, and you'll get a Q&A from the original launch of the course. Plus, you'll get implementation things to help you along the way, including some checklists. These are some things that past students have said. Feel free to pause to read if you would like to. You can also find even more in my SEO for Travel Bloggers Facebook group if you search the term 50K. That's a value of 2,950 bucks for only $149.
