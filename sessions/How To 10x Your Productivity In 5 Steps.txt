Hi, I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging, and I am delighted to be speaking here at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am super excited because I've been asked to speak on one of my favorite topics and that's productivity. In this jam pack session, I'm going to show you how you can 10x your productivity in just five steps. Let's dive in, shall we?

[00:00:34.860] - Speaker 2
So first up, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Eb Gargano and I am the blogger behind Easy Peasy Foodie and Productive Blogging, and I've been blogging since 2015, and in that time I have grown my food blog to over 1 million monthly page views. I have launched five successful online blogging courses with almost 2000 students enrolled. I also run two Facebook groups, and I managed to publish about 6-8 blog posts per month, plus send out 6-8 blog newsletters per month, as well as keep on top of two inboxes and nine social media accounts, and I earn a comfortable six-figure salary.

[00:01:30.330] - Speaker 2
And yet I work pretty much Monday to Friday, nine to five. I take time off during my kid's school holidays. I take most weekends off. I also take random midweek days off pretty much whenever I want to. I do outsource a couple of things, but 95% is done by me. I don't have a large team supporting me. I'm a soloprenure and people always ask me how, how do you do it? How do you get so much done? How do you achieve so much and yet still have a life?

[00:02:14.960] - Speaker 2
How are you so productive? Well, that is what this session is all about. I'm going to take you through five things that will help you 10X your productivity and help you achieve more while working less. But first I'd like you to meet three people. First up we have Anna the action taker. She's going to listen to this session, take copious notes, and take action on what I share. Starting today, a year from now she's going to be working less, achieving more, and hopefully seeing real results in her bank account.

[00:02:55.270] - Speaker 2
Okay, next up we have Susie sounds nice. She is going to listen to this talk. Say that sounds nice, but she won't put it into practice a year from now she'll still be working like a crazy thing and still not seeing results. And finally, we have Wendy won't work for me. She'll listen to this session and say, Nah won't work for me. She won't even give it a try. A year from now she's still going to be working like a crazy thing and still not seeing results.

[00:03:32.510] - Speaker 2
So which of these three characters are you going to be? Are you going to be Anna, Susie or Wendy? Go ahead and type the name into the chat and just to let you know this session is prerecorded so that I can be right in the chat with you. So if you have any questions as I go through this session, please ask away and I will answer as many as I can get to. Right. Then I'm hoping that you said, Anna, the action taker. Because if you take action on these strategies, I'm about to share with you, it might just change your life.

[00:04:08.970] - Speaker 2
So enough of the intro. Let's dive into the first of our five steps. Step one is to define what you want. Maybe that's not what you were expecting. Maybe you thought I'd be giving you some Ninja time management strategies. Well, we'll come on to that in a bit, but the thing is, if you don't know where you're heading or if you're heading in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter how well you manage your time. You're not being productive. The problem with so much productivity advice out there is it's not productivity advice in its true sense.

[00:04:56.280] - Speaker 2
It's efficiency advice while being efficient is good. It's not going to help you if you're doing the wrong things. That kind of advice is just going to help you get more and more efficient at doing the wrong things. Let's take the analogy of a car. You can get the fastest car. You can fill it with the best fuel you can take an advanced driving course. You can take the racing line on every single corner. But if you are heading in the wrong direction, none of that will help you.

[00:05:31.710] - Speaker 2
The first step in being truly productive is to define what you really want from your blogging business. So I'm going to make this first step really simple. If you're here at this summit learning how to be more productive. I'm pretty sure that the number one thing you want if you're really honest with yourself is money. Now, that might look slightly different for each of you. Maybe some of you want to earn enough to quit your nine to five, maybe some of you want to earn a nice part-time income.

[00:06:12.030] - Speaker 2
Maybe some of you want to earn a decent full-time income, and maybe some of you want to earn six, multiple, six, or even seven figures. But here's the thing. There are lots of ways you can earn money in this life. So why don't you choose to blog? If you're anything like me, then you have a few other goals. First up, you want to earn money in a way that you find enjoyable. You want to earn money in a way that allows you to help other people.

[00:06:46.170] - Speaker 2
Perhaps most importantly, you want to earn money passively or at least semi-passively, so that you can have flexibility over your timetable so that you can also do things like spend time with your family and friends, pursue your hobbies, take vacations, take random days off, go to your kids, end of time show. So did I get that right? Is that what you want to? Either way, let me know in the chat. The trouble is, that for most bloggers, it's the other way around. Perhaps that's you right now, you aren't making as much money as you want, and you're working way more hours than you want.

[00:07:33.810] - Speaker 2
Am I right? So how do we fix this? Keep listening, because I'm coming to that. Okay, so step one was to define what you want. Step two is to define how you are going to get there. So if what you want is to earn a decent income, do something you love helping your audience out with their problems, working flexibly and not working crazy hours, how do you achieve that? For me? As I've worked through these questions for myself, the conclusion I've come to is to focus on passive income strategies.

[00:08:19.350] - Speaker 2
And although nothing is ever 100% passive in the blogging world, by focusing on passive income strategies, I can work less. I can have more control over my time, and I can earn more because my income is not tied to the number of hours I have available in the day. And for me, what that looks like is a blend of ad income, affiliate income, and selling digital products. Now you might come to a slightly different conclusion, and that's totally okay. This session is not about me telling you what to do, but rather giving you the questions that you need to ask yourself.

[00:09:02.900] - Speaker 2
But whatever you decide, I would encourage you to focus on multiple income streams because none of us knows what lies around the next corner. And relying on just one income stream is a very precarious place to be. Okay, so you have defined what you ultimately want to achieve with your blog. You've defined how you're going to get there. Now it's time to move on to step three. Step three is to define the three most impactful tasks. Okay, so here's the thing. You can't do everything. There are just so many things that we could be doing as bloggers, I reckon I could employ an army of VA's and still not feel like I was doing everything.

[00:09:58.440] - Speaker 2
This is a really important mindset shift that you have to make if you want to be truly productive, it's so important that I'm going to repeat it. You can't do everything. And this is fundamental because it's only when you truly accept that you can't do everything that you realize you have to choose. And here's another important thing to get your head around. Some tasks are going to move the dial more than others. One of the biggest secrets to being truly productive is to pick the tasks that are going to have the biggest impact.

[00:10:37.650] - Speaker 2
Now, you may have heard of the 80 20 rule. I'm slightly paraphrasing here, but basically what it says is that 80% of your results are being driven by 20% of the things on your to-do list. Take a moment to stop and think about that. What would happen if you stopped doing all those low-impact tasks and did more of that 20% of tasks that are driving 80% of your results. That would be five X your productivity in one fell swoop. But we can do better because I'm willing to bet that some of the most impactful tasks aren't even on your dealership right now, and that's what step three is all about.

[00:11:29.610] - Speaker 2
Okay, so let's say you are like me, and you have decided that you are going to focus on the three passive income strategies I mentioned before, so that's ads, affiliates, and digital products. In this step, your task is to write down what you consider to be the three most impactful tasks you could do for each of those three monetization strategies. Now, obviously, this is going to depend on where exactly you are in your blogging journey right now. But here's an example. Let's start with Ads for most people.

[00:12:04.720] - Speaker 2
The way to get good money from ads is by focusing on SEO. So you might say here that the three most impactful strategies are keyword research, creating lots of new, high-quality blog posts based on that keyword research, and updating your old content. For affiliates, you might pick researching affiliate schemes in your niche, going beyond Amazon, and finding affiliate schemes with better Commission, maybe even recurring Commission. You might also pay to optimize your top 20 posts with relevant affiliate links. And finally, you might pick creating new content that targets buyer intended keywords.

[00:12:48.810] - Speaker 2
In other words, keywords, which the ideal customers for your affiliate products are typing into Google when they're in the mood to buy. And then for digital products, you might pick making a new product, building out an evergreen sales funnel, and working on growing your email list with a really good new lead magnet that's going to attract the perfect buyers for your new product. Again, these are just examples. You may come to very different conclusions, but if you've already thought of a few ideas, a few of those most impactful tasks, I would love to hear about them.

[00:13:30.190] - Speaker 2
So let me know in the chat. Okay, so now you have to find your most impactful tasks. The next step is to take those impactful tasks and turn them into an action plan. Now, obviously, you can't do all nine of those most impactful tasks all at once. So you're going to have to think about the most logical order to do them. In what order should you do these tasks for maximum impact? So let's continue with our example. Maybe you start by focusing on affiliate links so you can spend month one researching affiliate programs and optimizing your top 20 posts with affiliate links.

[00:14:13.740] - Speaker 2
And this will mean that those blog posts are going to be earning money for you passively or year long. You could also do some keyword research, and this will help you to identify those buyer intent keywords as well as other keywords which are going to drive traffic. So you can grow your blog and earn more ad income. Then maybe in month two, you might decide to focus on your digital product a little, maybe figuring out what you're going to create and then coming up with that awesome lead magnet so you can start growing your list with the perfect people.

[00:14:51.600] - Speaker 2
So that when you come to actually create and launch your product later in the year, you already have a ready-made list of red hot buyers. You might also decide to create a welcome sequence and or a nurture sequence to warm those new subscribers up and get them to know, like, and trust you. Maybe if your email marketing isn't really quite up to scratch, you might also do a bit of work getting that into shape. Then in month three, you might decide to focus on SEO updating old posts, and creating new posts based on your keyword research.

[00:15:29.480] - Speaker 2
And maybe you do that in month four too. So you do a really big push so you can get lots of new and updated posts ranking on Google and sending you traffic for the whole of the rest of the year. And then in month five, you might start working on your digital product and so on again. This is just an example. This might not be quite right for you. Use your logic and figure out what would be the best order to do your most impactful tasks so you get the most bang for your buck.

[00:16:08.370] - Speaker 2
Now you might be thinking this is more work got less. That's because we haven't got to step five yet. So step five is to remove from your Todo list everything which is not directly helping you achieve your goals for this year. This is where the magic happens. I want you to take your Todo list and also everything else that is still stuck inside your head that hasn't even made it to your dealers yet. Write all that stuff down and then take a long, hard look at it.

[00:16:47.410] - Speaker 2
What is not helping you hit those goals? What is not helping you achieve those nine most impactful tasks? Because we as bloggers, do a lot of busywork. Am I right? Busy work is either totally pointless stuff or stuff that's in that 80% of tasks that is only producing 20% of your results in order to make time to do the right thing. For Your most impactful tasks, you need to remove pretty much everything else off your to-do list. In other words, you need to remove everything that's not actually helping you drive your business forward.

[00:17:32.110] - Speaker 2
I'm warning you, it's going to be painful, but it's so worth it because you're taking off good things and replacing them with better things. You're taking off busy work and replacing it with effective work that's actually going to make a difference to your bottom line. Now, what you take off is going to be different for different people. So for example, for me, that's things like Instagram reels and TikTok and tidying my Pinterest boards and most sponsored post opportunities that come my way and doing coaching calls just to name a few.

[00:18:14.570] - Speaker 2
Now, most of those things are really good things are those are the best things for me to be doing with my time. Are those things that are going to give me the most bang for my buck? No, of course, you may come to completely different conclusions. Perhaps you are absolutely killing it on ticktock right now, and that is the thing that's going to give you the most bang for your buck. Again, you need to figure this one out for yourself, but be careful. It's very easy to start thinking that this kind of busywork is somehow essential.

[00:18:55.270] - Speaker 2
It's not. Remember, we are removing the good to make way for the better. So everyone I want you to type one thing into the chat that's coming off your Todo list. Okay, now, because I always like to over-deliver. There's a step six and step six is to test every new opportunity, every shiny new object against your plan, because stuff is going to come up. New opportunities, new, brilliant ideas that pop into your head. Stuff you see other bloggers doing, and you are going to be tempted.

[00:19:40.460] - Speaker 2
So tempted to add more stuff to your to-do list. And if you're not careful soon, you will be swamped with a whole new load of busy work and your most impactful tasks will be pushed to the side and probably never get done. You are going to have to be strict with yourself this year if you truly want to ten X your productivity. Now, I guess you might be thinking this is all well and good at, but I was hoping for some strategies to make me more efficient.

[00:20:14.200] - Speaker 2
Maybe some Ninja time management tips. But the truth is, I could have done that talk, but it would have been like giving you a bandaid for a broken leg without doing the steps I've outlined in this session. At best, those Ninja efficiency tips would have two X your productivity, and I promise to ten X your productivity. And the stuff I've talked about today is the stuff that's going to ten X your productivity. Only once you've done this stuff, only once you've worked through the five or rather six steps I've outlined in today's session.

[00:20:49.220] - Speaker 2
Will those Ninja efficiency tips truly help you now? Of course, I do have those Ninja time management strategies to help you be more efficient. And if I had an extra 30 minutes, I would give them to you. But I don't. So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to give you a free copy of my ebook blog, Smarter, Not Harder. In part one of this book, I go through all the things we've covered in today's session, but in much more detail. And in part two, I share my Ninja efficiency strategies so you can get even more done in even less time.

[00:21:28.640] - Speaker 2
But I want you to promise me something. I want you to promise me you won't skip straight to part two, because if you do, the only thing that will happen is you'll get more efficient at doing the wrong things. Please, please take the time to do part one. That is the thing that will ten X your productivity. Then once you've done part one, part two is the thing that will turbocharge that once you are doing the right things, then supercharge that by working more efficiently to get my book, go to productive blogging.

[00:22:08.810] - Speaker 2
Com ebook. And then when you read it and start putting it into practice, I want you to email me at ebb at Productiveblogging dot. Com and tell me all about it. Okay. So remember our three friends. Are you going to be Anna the action taker? Of course, you are. In which case, go to Productivelogging. Com ebook and grab that ebook and then type into the comments, downloaded it, and then go read that book and put it into action. Do not put this on your maybe one day list.

[00:22:43.970] - Speaker 2
Do not download the ebook and then find it away and never read it. Download the ebook right now and start reading it and putting it into practice today. Strike while the iron is hot. Start while you are excited and motivated by this talk because if you download it and put it into practice might just change your life. And by this time next year, you could be in a place where you are working less and earning more. So just to recap, go to productiveblogging. Com ebook, download the book, then type into the comments, downloaded it, then go read that book and put it into action.
