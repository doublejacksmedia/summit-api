Hey, everyone, this is Kara from SimplifyingDIYDesign, where I teach bloggers and online business owners how to use design in their business to create social media, graphics, lead magnets, digital products, all sorts of things. So I am super excited to talk to you today about using Canva to create promotional graphics for more sales and sign ups. It does not stop when we finish our lead magnet or our digital product. We have to use visual promotion to get more eyes on that offer.

[00:00:38.510] - Kara
So before we jump in, I just want to go over what we're going to talk about today.

[00:00:44.780] - Kara
We're going to talk about the different types of graphics that you can create to promote your products and lead magnets, the different layers of promotion and how to adjust your graphic to save more time and how to create them right inside of Canva. So before we jump in to the actual design part, I want to go over mockups. Mockups are a great way to turn your digital product into something visual. So if it's a course or if it's a workbook or anything like that, that mockup is going to give somebody a visual sense of what your offer is without them even having to really look at it.

[00:01:26.000] - Kara
So if you can see some examples here, this one is is just a template from my membership. But I think it gives you a good sense of like, this is a notebook, you know what I mean? So if you put your cover on that, that's a mock up of your notebook. You can keep it simple. This is one that I use on my sales page before. It's just kind of showing the different pages of that that workbook.

[00:01:51.260] - Kara
These are obviously more like courses because we have it on the computer screen. So what you choose to put your product on is going to give people a good sense. You know, computers are great for courses, a notebook binder, even just fanning sheets. That's great for like workbooks and ebooks and things like that. Tablet could also be great for an ebook or even a course or whatever you are creating.

[00:02:16.880] - Kara
So I do kind of want to show you how to actually create a mockup inside a Canva, because you're going to need that not only on your sales page, not only on your ads, but all of the different designs that you create to promote your offer. You can use your mockup on. OK, so let's jump over to Canva so you can see a couple of examples of how you can lay things out. OK, so say you have a course and you got an e-book or a workbook as a bonus and you have other, you know, checklists and printables and things like that as bonuses.

[00:02:54.020] - Kara
You can put all of that in one mockup image and you can use these mockups again. You can use them on all of your pins, all of your Facebook posts, your ads, your sales page, whatever you want. It's going to start with this mockup. So I want to show you real quick how you can make that from scratch. Like, these are just examples from templates that I have inside of one of my courses. But you can definitely make these from scratch.

[00:03:18.860] - Kara
So we're going to go over to elements and I'm sorry, the Loom thing is, is covering that, but it's the elements tab. And I'm going to type in iPad. OK, so you can see there are some options here, but they don't really look realistic. Right. So I'm going to go to photos and I'm going to type in iPad. And now we can see. All right, there are some options here that look really realistic.

[00:03:44.390] - Kara
OK. You can even see that they have things set up that are already laid out for you. But basically what we want to do is we want to take that iPad or that computer. OK, you can even try to find a woops, a notebook, OK, or binder, see, these ones have like a curved edge, so I probably want to use that.

[00:04:17.450] - Kara
But you can always take something like this. That's. OK, you know, and there are different things that you can try, you can try Binder. You can try a clipboard. You know, there's there's a lot of different things that you can play with. So anyway, let's jump into this and you can even make yourself a little template. What I'm going to do is I'm going to use these as the basic shape and then I'm going to fill it in with a grid, [inaudible 00:04:54] .

[00:04:54.110] - Kara
There we go. So you might have to go to position and move it forward. And I'm just going to place it right inside of that space. I just copied and pasted it so that I can use another one and I'm going to copy and paste again. OK. OK, now I want to show you another little trick, because I get asked quite often. No, there's not a great way to create a shadow inside of Canva. But if you go over to my site simplifying DIY design, if you're not already signed up for my free library, you can do so.

[00:05:49.130] - Kara
You just go to design library, sign up for access. But if you already have the password, you can go ahead and jump in and all the way at the bottom.

[00:05:59.870] - Kara
So I have lots of free templates, tutorials, resources, checklist, Trello boards of all sorts of things. But one of the thing all the way down at the bottom is shadow to add to printables in Canva. OK, so if you download it and then upload it right to Canva. OK, so I'm going to then hop back over to Canva and I'm going to upload it. Right into my images, so now I have a page that has a nice little shadow to it.

[00:06:42.660] - Kara
OK. And what you're going to do is you're going to, again, place a, move that forward for, a minute. Place a grid right over that. Now you have a page that has a shadow.

[00:07:11.510] - Kara
OK, so you're going to drag and drop your page from your product into that little space. OK, I'm going to move to back and then I'm going to copy and paste it and kind of fan it out. OK, so this is how you can just arrange whatever you have to offer in Canva really quickly.

[00:07:33.600] - Kara
So now what you would do is you would go to your product anywhere, download individual pages from that product as JPEG images. OK, so then you would have you would really upload them to Canva so that you have the pages as images inside of Canva because you cannot upload a PDF. I'm trying to find a good example. OK, so I have my cover here and I could do like a screen here. And let's do just, you know, for time's sake here, see how just drag and drop and now I have a mockup up.

[00:08:23.970] - Kara
So once you have the mock up the way that you want it to be, you would just go ahead and download it. If you have Canva Pro, you can download it with a transparent background. And I'm just going to click on that one page. So that's all it downloads. And now I have it on my computer so that I can use it on my sales page. I can use it in my promotional designs. I'm going to crop it really quick.

[00:08:54.250] - Kara
And then I'm going to upload it back in the Canva so we have it to use on our promotional designs.

[00:09:00.340] - Kara
OK, so now that we covered the mock up, it is kind of the first step of the promotional graphics. So I hope that was a little bit helpful to kind of get that baseline in there. But now I want to talk about the different types of graphics that you can create to promote your product.

[00:09:17.480] - Kara
So it's not a secret that sometimes people take a lot of exposure to something in order to feel comfortable enough to buy that thing. I think the average is like seven times they have to hear about a product or even about you before they have that desire to actually like really check it out. So kind of being everywhere all at once is a great way to get a lot of different eyes on your offer. So ways you can do that. And again, there are a lot of different layers to promotion, too, and we'll talk about that and how you can adjust these things.

[00:09:56.740] - Kara
But before we talk about that, I want to talk about those different types of graphics that you can create as your base designs and get your offer out there. So things that you can do are creating pins for your digital product or lead magnet or whatever offer you have. You can do square images for Facebook and Instagram. You can do social media headers. It's so important to have that call to action right in your social media. How you can change your button on Facebook, the Facebook page to go right to your opt in page if you want.

[00:10:30.290] - Kara
If you have a sale going on, things like that. Update your social media headers to reflect that, offer graphics for your blog. You can add them into your sidebar. You can add images into your blog posts. You can promote your lead magnet's show them a little visual example of what your lead magnet looks like. Add in related digital products that you might have into your blog posts.

[00:10:53.500] - Kara
A lot of different areas on the blog that we can promote writing in your home page, even if you have an offer that you want to get a lot of eyes on advertisements, of course, not required, but if you are in a place that you are running ads, you can do ads for Facebook, Instagram, you can do promoted pins. And then of course, video content so you can create video pins. You can do stories on Facebook and Pinterest, you, and Instagram, sorry, and IGTV.

[00:11:23.500] - Kara
Of course, that is the Instagram platform for videos and then of course, Facebook. So there are so many different ways that we can create visual content to promote whatever our offer is. So let's get designing.

[00:11:38.470] - Kara
I want to hop back over to Canva and show you a little bit of what I'm talking about. So I'm going to do a tutorial about basically how to design a pin using your, using a mockup. OK, so here are a couple of examples, and this is another way you can do it. So if you don't have the ability or want to do something like I showed you before, you can always find an image or, you know, if you have Depositphotos or whatever you use for your stock photos, you can find an image that has something already on it.

[00:12:11.740] - Kara
So you can see there's a piece of paper and overlay a grid, kind of like I did when I was making the mockups, OK. Same thing goes for a tablet. If we didn't have a tablet and we wanted to look for. Let's see, that's OK. So say we have a desk. OK, and we want to add an iPad to it. And you can do something like that. So now I have the iPad and it looks like it's laying on the desk.

[00:13:05.050] - Kara
OK, so then you would just add your product cover to it and there you go. You have a mockup that's a little bit different than what we were talking about. These are obviously templates.

[00:13:17.050] - Kara
I had them in my DIY Design Creator's vault, but they I also have free templates inside of my design library, as I mentioned. So if you're designing this right from scratch, we can do this a lot of different ways. You can see that the all of these are pins are designed with just using shapes and text. So it doesn't have to be very complicated if you're creating a pin or any kind of visual graphic for your blog or for social media.

[00:13:47.170] - Kara
I usually just start with a square and make a footer, especially for Pinterest. And you can, of course, use your brand colors. The next thing you want to do is add some text and I'm going to put in, OK? That now I want a background, so I have to decide, OK, do I want to do a color background and add my mock up image? You can absolutely do that. You can do patterns if you want, and I already have that.

[00:14:29.280] - Kara
And uploads should be. And then I'm just using shapes, really. And I'm copying pasting, just use your keyboard shortcuts, control C, control V for paste, OK? And now I want to add my text and you could either just write the name of your product, but I like to kind of give it give an idea of a transformation of what the product actually does. So I'm pretending this is like a lead magnet, it's actually a bonus for one of my courses, but I'm just pretending for the sake of the tutorial, it's a lead magnet and we're going to say free workbooks so you can.

[00:15:45.050] - Kara
OK, so I give them a result basically in that headline. I'm going to adjust my line high up here because I like my lines pretty close together and then I'm going to use a corner to kind of make it the size that I want. OK, there are a lot of different things that you can do on text and on pins to make the text stand out if you wanted to. You can search different types of text if you want, like a bold text.

[00:16:13.250] - Kara
I don't really worry too much about staying super on brand when it comes to fonts on my pins.

[00:16:20.450] - Kara
I try to stay more on brand when it comes to Facebook and things like that. I just want something that's going to fit fit the content the best so you can line up your text just right. I like to use my arrow keys to get things positioned just right. You can change your color to match your brand. You can highlight one word to make it stand out.

[00:16:50.780] - Kara
OK, I like to use warm color accents on my pins for sure. If it's not in the photo, then I use it on my design. So the same type of idea would go for if we're using a stock photo background.

[00:17:05.540] - Kara
OK, so we're going to do a desk and let's see. My research notebook, because I want to grab that notebook again. Now, line this up so that it is looking like it's laying on the desk, that the macaroons are on my way here for this one. There we go. OK, so now once I have that adjusted the way that I want to, I'm going to add my image.

[00:17:57.630] - Kara
You can skip the grid if you want to and just go right to adding your cover to it. The grid is kind of if you're wanting to make a template for yourself. OK, so you can see how I've essentially made a mockup out of that stock photo. There is a paid option as well. I am at my Ecovermaker.com, and if you sign up for an account, you can choose different things as basically a mockup generator. So you'll upload your cover art or whatever you want to upload to any of these things.

[00:18:42.100] - Kara
And it will generate a an image for you that has a transparent background and it has the cover on it.

[00:18:49.420] - Kara
There are some free options that you can use if you want to. I mainly use it for the notebook because I just I really like how it looks.

[00:18:59.050] - Kara
It is a paid tool, like I mentioned, and they're usually $5 each. Or you can sign up for the membership, which is $15 a month. So if I have a lot to make, I'll just I'll sign up for the membership, make as many as I can, and then downgraded it time and again. But you can sign up for a free account. And that's another option as well for your promotional graphics.

[00:19:24.310] - Kara
OK, so we made a pin and we can obviously then use the resize tool if you're using Canva Pro to create your square graphics, your. I like to do like a horizontal graphic for my blog post so that it doesn't take up a ton of scrolling space. I usually use for that if you type in Facebook ads of those 1200 x 628, that's usually what I use inside of my blog post. Like if it's in the content that I'm like promoting a product that's the size I like.

[00:19:57.670] - Kara
But of course it's up to you. You can use a square as well so that if somebody tries to pin it, it'll look better on Pinterest. OK, so let's hop back over to our presentation since we just designed a pin. And we're going to talk now about the different types of graphics that you can use in all the different layers. OK, so there are a lot of things to consider when you're doing a promotion. Do you have a prelaunch period?

[00:20:24.520] - Kara
Do you have an early bird special? Do you have special offers ending? Do you want to create additional graphics for your affiliates to use? Are you doing an affiliate launch like this isn't even your product and you want to be promoting affiliate products that you're an affiliate for graphics, for doors closing. Do you have an open close, you know, offer course or anything that's only open for a short amount of time and doors are closing? These are a lot of different things that you consider and you don't have to.

[00:20:57.790] - Kara
It sounds like a lot, but you really can repurpose what you created when you have these designs. You can really repurpose them just by changing up what the text says. So now, if I was doing a Facebook ad and I'm going to use the same.

[00:21:24.360] - Kara
Oh, Instagram story. So if I was doing a Facebook ad now. When doing the original and you're likely going to have something that looks like.

[00:21:50.750] - Kara
So let's say, ah, we have a special flash sale, k. So I'm going to have the text say flash sale. Get a little bit bigger, but not too bad, because especially if it is a Facebook ad, Facebook doesn't like that. OK, so what am I going to do is say.

[00:23:03.480] - Kara
OK, so you can see all I'm doing is changing the text, I'm keeping the rest of it the same, you don't have to make a million different graphics. You can easily just adjust what you have. So if you wanted to say, posted on your Instagram and we were starting with this design. I can just grab something from another page or anything like that, or you can change the text that you had in the original image so you can change this text to say something else.

[00:24:14.210] - Kara
OK, so you can see how we can repurpose what we already have and make a ton of graphics from.

[00:24:20.620] - Kara
It doesn't have to be super complicated and it's very easy to do right inside of Canva. Now, before I hop off, I want to share with you a little trick, because I really think that this is awesome for promotion of lead magnets, digital products, all these things I use it on a sales page. I use it in Facebook ads. I use it a lot. So I'm going to give you a little glimpse of what it is. OK, so see how everything's moving.

[00:24:56.920] - Kara
OK, but this is a little different. This is everything staying the same except for what's on the screen. OK, so whether it be an iPad, a notebook, an ebook phone, you can keep everything the same and just flip through the pages of your product. OK, so again, this is an example of how I've used that on the sales page and I'm going to show you how you can do that in Canva for free. You do not need the pro version to do this.

[00:25:27.880] - Kara
I'm going to. OK, so. I'm going to start with, OK, I want to start with this design, so what you're going to do is if you are designing this from scratch, you're going to want to design one thing first one, one design. Just keep it to one design ,one page. If you're using a template, edit the template the way that you want it. Do not move on until you have one design exactly the way that you want to.

[00:25:58.540] - Kara
OK, so I'm going to just use this template here. OK, and I have used the template to make a very quick promotional look, and now I'm going to go right into page manager. So if you saw that this is a little button in the middle, says grid view, used to be called page manager, Canva changes things a lot.

[00:26:42.220] - Kara
And I'm going to duplicate that image however many times I need to.

[00:26:46.570] - Kara
OK, so you know what? First, I want to add, add a grid because I want all the pages to be exactly in the same spot and then go back to elements and I'm going to go down the grids. Hey, I'm going to turn it. Lay it out exactly how I want the pages of my work book to be. Lined up. OK, now try that again.

[00:27:33.640] - Kara
So I'm going to duplicate it, so if you want to show off 10 pages, you'll have 10 pages of the same image. If you have three pages again, you'll just have three pages of the image. But just do it as many times as you need and then you're going to go back into your design and you're going to upload those page images. OK, so remember how he said you'll download your product pages as JPEG images and you'll re upload them to Canva.

[00:28:01.760] - Kara
OK, so I'll have my cover, I'll have my first page, my second page done. OK, so again, if you have 10 pages, just keep on going. Now when we download it, we're going to download it as a gif and we're going to make sure all the pages are selected and click on download. OK, so I'm going to open this up and I'm going to show you what it looks like. Because I think this is so slow and for whatever reason, you inside of Canva, you can't adjust the speed.

[00:28:49.610] - Kara
So I do have a little workaround for this and it's free. It is called easygif.com/speed. OK, so you're going to upload that image, that gif right inside of there and then click on upload. OK, so now I can see a little preview of what it looks like. And right below that, you're going to see this area here where you can do the percentage of current speed and I'm going to do five hundred and click on Change Speed.

[00:29:23.270] - Kara
So now you can see it's much faster and you can do it as fast as you want if you want to. Even faster than that, click on Change Speed and it's really fast now. OK, so once you get it the way that you want it, you'll just go ahead and save it. It'll automatically download to your computer. And now if we open that one. You can see that we have a much faster image, so this is the one that you would want to use for your ads or your sales page or wherever you are promoting that product in a visual way.

[00:30:02.190] - Kara
