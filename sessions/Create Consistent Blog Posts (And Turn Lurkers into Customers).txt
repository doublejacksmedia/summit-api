First things first, I just want to say thank you so much to Elizabeth for inviting me to be here with you all today. I'm so excited to be here and thank you for all of you that have shown up here with me live. Now while we're waiting, I just want to know what your biggest struggle with content creation is. We're going to wait just a second. I've got a few housekeeping items that we're going to go over as we wait for maybe a couple more people to come in here with us so they can be part of the live chat. But I want to know while we do that, what is your biggest struggle with content creation?

[00:00:41.880] 
Now, those housekeeping items? If you're watching this during the live presentation time, I am here in the chatbox with you. So please drop any and all questions you have into that chatbox. If you're not watching this, if you're watching this later in the day, please feel free to drop any and all questions you have inside the Facebook group and tag me so that I make sure to see them. 

[00:01:05.440] - Amanda
And finally, if you've grabbed the Pro Pass for yourself and you're watching this much later on and there's no more Facebook group, no more live chat. I'm still here to answer any questions that you have. Just hop over onto Instagram. Hop into my DMs. Let me know what questions you have. I am here for you.

[00:01:22.350] 
Also, if something really resonates with you during this presentation, please feel free to take a picture and share it on Instagram. Just make sure that you tag me. I'm @MsAmandaWarfield.

[00:01:34.830] 
Now, for those of you that have not met me yet, Hi, I'm Amanda. As a simplicity-focused content marketing strategist, I help creative entrepreneurs at marketing into their business without it taking over their business. I'm also the host of the Chasing Simple Podcast, a podcast to help creative entrepreneurs uncomplicate their life and biz.

[00:01:54.810] 
I've been passionate about education since I was a child. I even used to take all of my old school workbooks and set up a "school" on my parents back porch for all the neighbor kids during the summer. I don't think that they liked it quite as much as I did, but now I've traded in my classroom lesson plans for speaking and educating creative and sustainably growing their businesses. 

[00:02:14.950] - Amanda
If my nose isn't in the book, you can usually find me annoying my husband by slipping Disney into every conversation or annoying my cats by forcing them to snuggle me. 

[00:02:24.810] - Amanda
Now it's your turn. Throughout this presentation, I'm going to have question boxes just like this that I want you to answer over in the live chatbox. If you're here live or in the Facebook group, but make sure to tag me.

[00:02:36.760] - Amanda
All right. Are you ready? Let's practice. Here's an easy one. Head to either of those places now and answer this question. What is your favorite food? Mine personally is potatoes, all forms, mash, chips, fried. Love it all. That's my favorite, but I want to know what yours is. So let me know either in, again, the chatbox or the Facebook group. Tell me what your favorite food is.

[00:02:57.990] 
Now you are in the right place if you want to create space in your business to work on needle-moving tasks. These are the ones that generate revenue and move your business from stuck-in-the-mud to on-a-roll. You're in the right place, if you want content creation to become less of a struggle. You're ready to say goodbye to that burnout and that rung-out content creation feeling. And you want to see growth not just in your follower counts, your views, your click-through rates, but also in your revenue. Your bottom line.

[00:03:32.010] - Amanda
Here's our roadmap for the next half hour. 

[00:03:34.180] - Amanda
First, we'll talk about the biggest mistake being made with content marketing and how you can avoid it. Then you'll learn three things you can start implementing to help avoid that mistake. Next, I'll show you how to take it a step further with something special I've created for you. But enough of the housekeeping. I am all about using time well, and I'd hate to waste yours, so let's dive on in now.

[00:03:57.180] - Amanda
Maybe no one has told you this yet, but creating content is part of your business, but it's not your entire business. So why are we spending so much more time creating content than we are promoting it? And maybe that's where you are right now. Taking a step back and looking at where I was spending my work time made it clear that I was spending so much time creating content, that I wasn't spending any time growing my business. I realized I was spending all of my time working on my content instead of my content working...Instead of letting my content work for me.

[00:04:35.060] 
I had this giant Trello board filled with things I wanted and needed to do in my business in order to make progress. And it was collecting dust. My to-do list each week never seemed to get any shorter because of the amount of time I was spending on content, and the content I was putting out wasn't doing me any favors. I decided it was time to figure out how to truly get ahead of my content so that I could make moves and grow my business. 

[00:05:00.870] - Amanda
Now it's your turn. Be honest. Are you spending more time creating your blogs and your other content than you are promoting it? Let me know, which one are you spending more time on?

[00:05:15.450] 
Now, I bet that you're familiar with what I was going through, what I call the "content creation hamster wheel." You're mentally exhausted from being in create mode, and your business isn't moving forward because you don't have time to do anything but create content. 

[00:05:30.090] - Amanda
You're working a lot, but getting nowhere. And finding time to spend with loved ones without work hanging over your shoulder feels impossible. Worst of all, you don't have the capacity to come up with a true strategy that will move the needle and get you out of this place, because you're exhausted from constantly being in create mode.

[00:05:49.830] 
Here's the tea or the coffee as the case may be. It's not just you and I that struggle with this constant creation hamster wheel. You might have heard of podfade, but if not, it's when a podcast suddenly stops putting out new episodes without any notice, likely because they got stuck on that hamster wheel and they just couldn't find their way off. 

[00:06:09.210] - Amanda
Here are some interesting statistics for you. So as of June 2021, Apple Podcast was host to over 2 million podcasts. But only about 34% of those were active podcasts, meaning that they had released a new episode within the last 90 days. So 34%, that doesn't even mention how many have gone inactive in less than 90 days. And there are similar happenings in the blogging community, in the YouTube community as well, not to even take into account the non-active social media accounts that are out there. Why is this? 

[00:06:49.340] - Amanda
Well, it's because we've been told to do the impossible! Create content and make sure it's being pushed out according to the ideal schedule of that platform. Keep up with industry best practices and algorithm changes. Do all of the behind the scenes work of growing a business, because marketing is just one small part of it And somehow keep the needle moving forward! Because you're told to do all of these things without any real instruction on how to do so sustainably, we end up caught up on that content creation hamster wheel. Pumping out content left and right and then abandoning it when we become burnout or too busy with clients.

[00:07:26.430] - Amanda
We've been told if you show up and create content according to these best practices, your business will grow. That's not what's happening, is it? You're spending all this time creating content and your business isn't growing and you don't have time to do anything else.

[00:07:41.550] - Amanda
Have you ever found yourself doing any of these things? Staying up late to get your blog post out for the next day, spending hours creating a blog post the day it's supposed to go out creating content and working while on vacation, or just throwing up your hands entirely and deciding to just skip it this week, and maybe the next and the next. 

[00:08:02.890] - Amanda
If creating your blog post feels like just too much to handle some weeks, it doesn't have to be this way. You can absolutely create content, build an engaged audience, and thus your bottom line, without constantly creating new content and without that content burnout.

[00:08:22.410] 
The reason that you aren't seeing that growth currently is that you're missing one or both of the most important aspects of content: consistency and quality. Consistency has been shown to increase revenue by 25%. Are you showing up as often, as you said you would, are you showing up on time, or do you find yourself apologizing to your audience for being late? 

[00:08:44.770] - Amanda
And if you are always consistent, is what you're putting out there high quality? Or are you just throwing something together in an effort to get it out there? Poor quality content has been shown to decrease the probability of a sale by 40%. You must have both consistency and high-quality content to keep building your audience and growing your business, which sounds like an impossible feat, right? But the good news is you can create high-quality content consistently without being stuck on that content hamster wheel. 

[00:09:19.690] - Amanda
You can make time to work on your business. You can make time in your business to work on needle moving tasks. And you can let your content work for you for much longer than you actually spend working on it. And once you've got your content creation under control, you're going to have way more time to actually move the needle in your business and see major growth.

[00:09:43.210] 
Now, here's another question for you. How is your content affecting your business most? Are you undermining your relationship with your audience due to that lack of consistency and quality? Or are you unable to make any moves forward because you're constantly creating mode and you don't have time for anything else? Or maybe there's some other way that content is holding you back. I would love to hear about it. Remember, if you're here with me live, drop your answer in the chat, or if you're watching later post in the Facebook group, let me know, how is your content affecting your business the most? 

[00:10:17.050] - Amanda
Now you might be thinking, "That's great for your student. I'm so glad that she was able to get off the hamster wheel and really start growing her business. That could never work for me." Maybe you're thinking that you only have so many hours to work each week between your full-time job and everything else that's going on. When you can do this full time, that's when you're going to be able to grow. 

[00:10:36.670] - Amanda
But the hard truth is that you're never going to get a full time, if you can't grow your business. Being stuck on the content creation hamster will mean that it's going to be nearly impossible for you to grow to a place of being able to replace your income. You've got to get off of that wheel before you'll be able to get to that place. Not to mention that you're sticking yourself in really dangerous territory when it comes to that burnout and podfade that we talked about earlier. 

[00:11:03.310] - Amanda
You also might be thinking it's not possible to get ahead with the content creation schedule I've got. 

[00:11:07.850] - Amanda
I've got to show up for my blog, my podcast, my email list, plus TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. The experts say that I need to post this many times a day and this many times a week. On all these different places. And if I'm not constantly creating new content, I'm going to lose the audience that I already have.

[00:11:24.310] 
Remember those two keys? The content to help with growth. High-quality, consistent content will do so much more for you than constant content. And you don't have to show up constantly in order to be consistent. I want you to take a moment and think about all the educators that you follow. The marketing gurus, if you will. Those wonderful educators are experts in what they do, but you don't see your favorite Instagram expert also telling you how to best show up and use LinkedIn, do you? 

[00:11:54.370] - Amanda
When you look at all the experts you follow, you may have the educators in your back pocket as a whole, telling you to be everywhere all the time, but individually, they're encouraging you to show up in one space, on one platform, not all of them. You do not need to show up on every platform, and you do not need to show up as much as you think you do. We get caught up thinking that we need to be everywhere all of the time. But that's just not true. 

[00:12:20.770] - Amanda
Soaking up so much content about all of those practices and all of these different places gives us the subconscious push to be all of the places. But less is more.

[00:12:31.270] - Amanda
Or you might even be thinking, "It's just not realistic for me to create content in advance. I change my mind away too often and whenever I decide that I'm going to post four weeks from now, but when that time comes, I'm not going to want to post about it."

[00:12:47.230] - Amanda
If you're running a business, you have got to plan long-term. If you want people to buy from you, you've got to be intentional about the content you're putting out. People don't buy without you intentionally taking the time to show them you're an expert in whatever it is that you're selling, without you carefully showing them whether or not they need what you're selling, and without you taking the time to walk them through any objections and questions that they may have. All of that takes intentional and long-term planning. 

[00:13:14.810] - Amanda
The bottom line is that your marketing, it's not about you. It's not for you. It's not about what you want to put out there. It's about what your audience needs you to put out so, it shouldn't be difficult to make a plan and stick to it.

[00:13:27.070] - Amanda
First. The first way that you're going to be able to simplify your content is to batch your content. 

[00:13:33.490] - Amanda
When was the last time you made a batch of cookies? I want you close your eyes, picture what I'm about to tell you in your mind. Okay? So, I'm going to share about the last time I made chocolate chip cookies. Are you ready?

[00:13:43.450] 
First, I pulled out my mixer, my cookie sheet, and all of the ingredients that I would need. Then I creamed together enough butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla for one cookie. I stirred in enough flour and chocolate chips for one cookie, and then I dumped out one bottle of cookie dough, put it on my baking sheet, and baked it for ten minutes. Once it was done, I started mixing together everything for the second cookie. I baked that one for ten minutes, and then I started mixing all the ingredients for the third. All in all, it took me just 2 hours or so in baking time to make a batch of cookies, not to count all of the prep and clean up for each. 

[00:14:20.890] - Amanda
Okay, that's a total lie. I've never actually done that with cookies. But when it comes to creating content, that's exactly how most people are creating their content. Most people think that batching their content means they need to do all of the steps of creation for each piece of content before moving on to the next. Just like creating one cookie at a time.

[00:14:43.570] 
Goes a little something like this outline Blog Post One, write Blog Post One, edit Blog Post One, schedule Blog Post One. Realize you've got three more of these to do, and you've already exhausted and given up and go have a snack or take a nap. 

[00:14:58.630] - Amanda
What you should be doing is creating content by step instead of by the content piece. 

[00:15:04.270] - Amanda
Let's use a blog post as an example. So, just like you would measure out enough ingredients for twelve cookies at once. You also want to outline an entire month of the blog post at once. Then you would move into the mixing phase, A.K.A, drafting them all. Next, the baking or editing phase, and finally cooling or scheduling all of them. 

[00:15:26.890] - Amanda
If you set aside one week each month just to create content, that is the number one way to get off the content creation hamster wheel. Not only is it way more efficient, just like baking a dozen cookies could either take ten minutes total or 120 minutes total. But it gives you three weeks each month to not have to think about content, allowing you to leave that content creation hamster wheel and burn out behind.

[00:15:53.830] - Amanda
So your action step for this step is to open up your planner or calendar and mark off a week that you're going to set aside for a batch week. Then mark off all of your batch weeks for the remainder of 2022. 

[00:16:07.540] - Amanda
But if you're thinking that is still a lot of content, how can I fit it all into just one week? And the answer is quite literally simple. Well, simplifying. You're going to create better content, less often. Now, how many coffee drinkers do we have in here today? Let me know in the chat.

[00:16:25.280] - Amanda
When we lived in the Seattle area, I became a huge coffee drinker. The gloomy weather just made it impossible to get through the day without it, and it was honestly rare for me, to go anywhere without a cup of coffee in my hand. I was drinking it all day long, every single day. But the more I drank, the less impressive it became. Since I was constantly making pot, after pot, after pot, after pot of coffee, it became a chore to get done as quickly as I possibly could so that I could get more coffee in my hand. 

[00:16:59.250] - Amanda
But after moving back home to South Carolina, I reallized I didn't need as much coffee. Thank you, Sunshine. And because I didn't need as much, I had more time to play around with my coffee making. So instead of just making a straight pot of coffee over and over and over again, I have more interest in maybe foaming up my creamer or brewing a latte. And even though I'm drinking less, the cups I'm drinking do way more for me. 

[00:17:25.470] - Amanda
Yes, they give me that caffeine kick, but they also give me a little boost of joy because they're just plain better than a standard cup of coffee. And just like my coffee, high quality, consistent content beats quantity of content every time!

[00:17:41.570] 
Instead of trying to show up everywhere all the time. The first way to help stay consistent with your content is by showing up less. Decide where your audience is most active and where you have the most fun because marketing should be fun and go there. Then once you cut down where you're showing up, I want you to cut down how often you're trying to show up in those places. 

[00:18:02.190] - Amanda
So just like with my coffee, if you're spending less time creating content, you'll have more energy to get creative, with what you're putting out there. Now, remember, you don't have to hit standards for best practices in order to see growth in your business. That's often a trap we fall into, thinking that I've got to hit the best standards. I've got to show up this many times a week, this many times a day all these different places. Best practices are great, but they're not required.

[00:18:29.150] 
Now your action step for this tip is to make a list of all the places (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, blog, etcetera) you're showing up and cutting it down. Then make a list of how much content you're trying to create and also cut that down. 

[00:18:45.170] - Amanda
The third step is to become an expert. I want you to take a moment and think about your best friend. When you thought of them, what was the first thing that came to mind for you? Was it a personality quirk, an interest of theirs? What was it? Let me know in the chat.

[00:19:02.570] 
When I think of my best friend? I think of California. Why? Because that's where she's from, and she talks about it constantly. On the flip side of that. When I think of California, I think of Megan. They've become linked in my mind. 

[00:19:15.210] - Amanda
But that didn't happen the first time I met her. It took months of us being friends and hanging out together and her talking about California. Lots and lots of repetition. If you want your audience to buy from you, you've got to become an expert in their mind. Often we feel like we need to constantly give our audience something new and fresh. But doing this is actually doing a disservice not only to you, but also to your audience. 

[00:19:42.230] - Amanda
Just like my best friend didn't become a link to my mind with California For many, many conversations. Your audience is not going to link you with what you do unless you repeat yourself over and over and over again. And how does this help with consistently showing up? Well, if you aren't having to scrape the barrel and constantly come up with new things to say, you can reuse what you've already created, saving a ton of time.

[00:20:08.720] - Amanda
You've spent a significant amount of time creating your long-form content, right? So make the most of your blogs by repurposing that content into your email and social media content. But not only that, you can literally reuse content that's already been created. The percentage of your audience sees any given post is so small and they're so inundated with content that they're not really going to remember any given post anyways. Plus, you get new followers constantly and they didn't see the last time you posted it. So spend less time creating content and become an expert in your audience's mind by being a broken record.

[00:20:46.910] - Amanda
Now your action step for this tip is to break up what you've already created into smaller, bite-sized pieces of content that can be used and scheduled to continuously promote your content over time, making it work for you for longer than it took you to create it.

[00:21:02.230] - Amanda
A few examples on how you can do this. So first, you can take the intro that you wrote for your blog post, and use that to get started writing the email that encourages your subscribers to go and read it. Another thing you can do is to take the main points of your blog post and create an Instagram post just going over those and encouraging your followers to head on over to the blog post to get more details about them.

[00:21:26.690] - Amanda
To recap those three steps to simplify your content in order to show up consistently were: 1. Batch your content; 2. Better content, less often; and 3. Become the expert. And your action steps for each of those were to mark off time for batch weeks on your calendar, simplify where you're showing up and how often you're showing up, and finally repurpose and reuse content that you've already created. 

[00:21:52.910] - Amanda
Now, here's another question for you. Which of these three do you plan to implement first? I would love to know which sounds the most enticing for your first step. 

[00:22:03.710] - Amanda
If you've been listening to this presentation and you know that you are struggling to build an engaged audience because you've been inconsistent, but you're ready to make a change. Now is the time to take action. Your next step is to start batching your content, but you don't have to figure out the how behind doing it on your own. If you're ready to take this to the next level, I invite you to head on  over to amandawarfield.com\free-bbs and grab the first lesson inside of my membership, Club Content Batching. Totally free.

[00:22:35.060] - Amanda
Watch this first lesson on the basic premises of content marketing and reframe how you think about content marketing, learn exactly how long you should be spending on content creation, and uncover the two most important things that all of your content needs.

[00:22:49.650] - Amanda
Thank you for showing up today and hanging in there with me and thank you, Elizabeth, again for having me. This has been such a joy! I invite all of you to come to find me over on Instagram and @Mrsamanda Warfield So that I can answer any follow-up questions that you may have to this presentation.

[00:23:04.670] - Amanda
And don't forget about the Pro Pass. If you want lifetime access to presentations and some really amazing bonuses that will help you continue to simplify your blog and see bigger results, you're going to want to make sure that you grab that.

[00:23:16.850] - Amanda
Now, if there's only one thing that you take away from this presentation, I want you to remember. The bottom line is that your content is an important part of your business, but it's only that, a part of it. It shouldn't take up most of your time, and it should be working for you for much longer than you spend working on it. If you want more time, more space, and more mental energy to grow your business, it's time to start batching your content.

[00:23:42.990] - Amanda
Now, one last question for you. What was your biggest takeaway from this presentation? Did you have any ah-ah moments? Is there anything that you're really excited to go implement? What stood out most to you? I would absolutely love to know.
