Are you ready to choose a profitable niche for your blog? I hope so because that is exactly what we're getting ready to do. My name is Heather, and I blog over at Ryder's Life for you. I'm a certified content marketing strategist and freelance niche writer who creates SEO-optimized content for other bloggers and business owners. So I know a little bit about content writing, and I know a lot about choosing a niche because it was seriously one of the hardest parts of blogging for me

[00:00:41.270] - Speaker 1
I mean, you have all these ideas in your head. How are you supposed to choose just one little topic to write about? Well, it's a little bit more than that, and it's actually a little bit easier than you think. I have a five-step process that I'm getting ready to walk you through. That not only will help you brainstorm a bunch of ideas for possible niches, you can do it'll also help you validate that niche, so you can make sure that it's profitable and popular right from the start.

[00:01:11.150] - Speaker 1
Choosing a niche is a big thumbing block for a lot of people. So you're not alone if this has been something that you're faltering with, so we're going to get ready to hop on into the presentation. Okay, we're going to jump into how to choose a blogging niche in five easy steps. This is my easy process of finding a money-making niche right from the very start. And so let's get going

[00:01:36.290] - Speaker 1
Here is what you'll learn. You'll learn what a niche is, why you need to niche down my method, which I called the Niche Ninja method because you're going to be a niche Ninja when you're done with this training and how to validate your niche. So what is a niche? A niche is a primary theme or topic that your blog revolves around. It's the subject that all your content focuses on.

[00:02:04.670] - Speaker 1
And you could also say it's an audience because you're writing to that one specific person on that one specific topic that they need help with, and that help can be entertainment.

[00:02:17.090] - Speaker 1
Maybe they're a new mom and they need help around nursing. It's your one topic that you really focus on.

[00:02:28.610] - Speaker 1
So why do you need a niche? Well, you're going to hear people that say you don't need the niche down, and then you're going to hear people like me say you need to niche down. And here's why. So Niching down allows you to establish expertise. And it also helps Google understand what you're writing about.

[00:02:50.450] - Speaker 1
And I'm going to use lifestyle blogs as an example. And don't get me wrong. Many lifestyle blogs can be popular. It's just that if you have a lifestyle blog that talks about a bunch of different topics, it's going to be harder for Google to understand what you're writing about. And I have a blogging friend that I use as an example.

[00:03:10.250] - Speaker 1
She had a lifestyle blog that had travel mom life weddings and then blogging about blogging. So none of those really go together. Exactly. And they all have different audiences. So she was told to niche down, and she did.

[00:03:30.710] - Speaker 1
She separated those all out into four blogs. And man, she started gaining traction much faster, started making money, and Google started sending her more traffic because it knew what her blog was about. So there really is. I've seen it in action that Niching Down really helps. I even separated out my blog.

[00:03:48.950] - Speaker 1
I was writing about blogging and freelance writing, but they can kind of have a different audience. So I split my blog up. So that's just an example. But why do you need a niche? It helps you establish your expertise.

[00:04:01.430] - Speaker 1
It helps you define your avatar, which is that one person that you're writing all your content. And I have a friend that says, Get to know your avatar so intimately. It's almost like you're stalking. You know their problems, you know who they are? Are they single?

[00:04:18.950] - Speaker 1
Are they married? Get to know your niche, get to know your avatar, get to know what that avatar really needs. So a niche also helps you find your true tribe of people, and it makes it easier to speak to your audience.

[00:04:35.330] - Speaker 1
It also helps you set your business apart from others because it allows you to establish that expertise. You can even stand out in a crowd. And I'll give you an example of Mike Pearson of stupid, simple SEO. Like, everybody knows him as an SEO expert. When you hear Mike Pearson's name, you know who he is.

[00:04:56.750] - Speaker 1
Same with. I'll say, Debbie Gardner. You know, Debbie is really good with SEO. I consider her an SEO expert, too. Your name becomes attached to that topic that you want to focus on and that you want to be recognized as an expert in.

[00:05:14.330] - Speaker 1
And so then also, a niche encourages collaboration, not competition. For example, say, I'm a travel blogger, and I do traveling in Florida. Well, you may know other travel bloggers like 1 may do traveling in Alabama, or you may have one that does traveling internationally or traveling in Europe because you all are in the exact same niche. Then you can get together and share resources and help each other out and share freebies and grow your blog together. It's not competition.

[00:05:50.870] - Speaker 1
It's more like working together. Plus, it also helps you make money faster because Google understands who you are and what you're talking about. They'll start sending you more traffic and more people will start buying your stuff and then online visibility. And that's really important, too.

[00:06:09.230] - Speaker 1
So Niching Down gives you more opportunities. It's not limiting despite what many people will tell you, it actually helps you make more money. It helps you focus on your Avatar's problems because you're speaking to that one person. It helps you create specific solutions to their problems, whether that's services or products plus, your services and products will resonate with them, and you'll find your true tribe of raging fans, which is really a big deal. It actually gives you more opportunities instead of limiting you and you can gain traction faster, just like my blogging friend that split everything up.

[00:06:44.990] - Speaker 1
She started gaining traction much faster.

[00:06:49.370] - Speaker 1
So the niche Ninja method here it is. It's a five-step process, and I have some worksheets that you can get below in the presentation that can help you walk through this process. So the first thing you look at is, what are you passionate about, sports, hobbies, or other similar activities? Number two is to look at niches that revolve around your work skills and education. I'm a good example of that because I was a police officer for 22 years, and so I chose to be a freelance writer on that topic.

[00:07:25.310] - Speaker 1
I help security businesses and law enforcement people and businesses. I write blog posts for them specifically, I am known as a security writer. I'm starting to change that a little bit, but that was my main gig. I wrote content for businesses in the security industry. Then there's what you learned through life experience.

[00:07:48.530] - Speaker 1
And I know a lot of people don't consider themselves experts in something that they didn't go to school on, but that's just simply not true. A lot of people don't take parenting classes and you can be really good at parenting or homeschooling. A lot of people had to start homeschooling. It was a big deal. So don't discount those.

[00:08:11.370] - Speaker 1
And I find that those are often the ones that people are more passionate about and really want to help people with. Then there's research and I lumped all this together because you'll see, if your niche is in demand, you'll look at the competitors and profitability. And then after all that, you cross-reference those niches on your list and narrow them down.

[00:08:33.450] - Speaker 1
So it's the different types of niches passions, life experience, or career education.

[00:08:42.570] - Speaker 1
So passion. It's a lot easier to write articles on something that you're passionate about. And that's why people really hate to niche down because they're like, well, I want to write about motherhood and I want to write about traveling, and I want to write about crafting, and I get it because I'm the same way. I didn't necessarily want to be focused on one thing, but in the beginning, that's the best way to do it to gain traction faster. So what hobbies, sports or other activities do you like doing?

[00:09:09.450] - Speaker 1
Do you like calligraphy? Do you like soccer? Do you like using your cricket things like that? So here are some examples. Calligraphy pickleball, which I had no idea what pickleball it was until recently.

[00:09:23.370] - Speaker 1
It's actually kind of interesting crafting, knitting, adventure, food, wine, running, and travel. And I should tell you right now, there's probably going to be some spelling errors in here. I've already seen some things. I don't know if any of you guys know Kate Doster, but I love her. She's like the email marketing guru, and she came up with something funny because she always had errors in her typing.

[00:09:48.390] - Speaker 1
And she said you can play the drinking game. And every time that you see a spelling error, you take a drink. Well, with me, you'd be taking a lot of drinks just to let you know I'm not perfect. Nobody is. I just thought I'd throw that out there that you all like that.

[00:10:02.670] - Speaker 1
So anyway, we're into a career in education now. So with career and education, like I mentioned, with my example, it's easier to establish your expertise and authority in a niche related to your career or education. My background is I have a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, and I have a master's degree in investigative intelligence studies is what my master is in. So those things really even solidify that hey, in my 22 years in law enforcement, all those things solidify. She's an expert in this.

[00:10:47.810] - Speaker 1
But I just throw that out there because you don't have to have the education. You don't have to be, like, known as an expert right away. You can still help people and still be seen as an expert, even if you don't have a degree, that's not necessary. But it was just easier for me to get started because more people would find me incredible because of that background.

[00:11:09.830] - Speaker 1
So some examples here would be technology. It bartender, astrology, accounting, architect, WordPress development, addictions counselor, archaeologists. Those are just some good examples of that. So then we come to life experience and blog. Niches that involve life experience are often the most popular.

[00:11:33.410] - Speaker 1
Many people overlook these ideas because they don't have a college degree on that topic or a background in it. But you don't need that to help others in these niches. So some examples here are personal finance, frugal, living, beauty, DIY, fashion, mom, life or parenting, pets, weddings, product reviews, starting an online business.

[00:11:56.690] - Speaker 1
Then we come to the research and demand profitability and competition. So the research is one of the most important parts because you need to research potential competitors and see if your niche is in demand. Because if it's not, then nobody is going to be searching for it. When you look for competitors in your possible niches, you can see how they make money. And that's a way to figure out if a niche is going to be profitable. How are other people in that chosen niche making money?

[00:12:26.390] - Speaker 1
And is it something that you can do, too? When I get to the examples, I'll show you some of them.

[00:12:33.830] - Speaker 1
Do they make products? Do they offer services? Do they make money through affiliate marketing? And you also need to see if your niche is in demand and popular? Are people searching for it?

[00:12:44.810] - Speaker 1
Are people looking for it? Does it have problems that need solving?

[00:12:51.090] - Speaker 1
So how do you see if your niche is in demand, who your competitors are and if it's profitable? Well, you use keyword tools basically like Google Forms and even Amazon. Amazon has a ton of information on it, as I'll show you, as is Google. So the tools that I mentioned on the following slides, some of them I'm going to give you an example of and show you how to do it. They can help you validate your niche so that you know it's popular right from the start.

[00:13:17.430] - Speaker 1
So tools you can use for validating your niche. Google, Amazon, the Google AdWords Keyword planner. And then you can use keyword research tools like key Search. Ahrefs, SIM rush. You can also use forms, Ubersuggest and Google Trends.

[00:13:37.890] - Speaker 1
So now here's the fun part, narrowing down your niches.

[00:13:42.510] - Speaker 1
While you're answering these questions, you may find that some of your niches overlap you may be really passionate about. We'll say numbers and you're an accountant. So maybe personal finance or accounting, something a topic like that is going to be one of those that you're really interested in and see that cross-references into some of the other choices.

[00:14:11.790] - Speaker 1
Maybe you love frugal blogging or frugal ligging. I got my Tang tumbled. Anyway, maybe you love frugal living and have a background in finance. If you find a profitable one that you're passionate about and you have a background in it, that is even better.

[00:14:29.310] - Speaker 1
That is like where you get gold stars.

[00:14:33.030] - Speaker 1
So what you need to remember is passion. What are you passionate about? What hobbies and sports do you like in your career? What are your career and educational background? Your life experience?

[00:14:47.010] - Speaker 1
What have you learned through your life experience? And then you do the research part where you look for competitors and profitability and see if it's on-demand and that's it. You have your perfect niche. That's really simple.

[00:15:04.390] - Speaker 1
When you have the worksheets, you can actually walk through this process and pick several niches that you want to validate. And that's what we're going to jump into now as some of those tools that you can use. Let's hop out of here.

[00:15:26.650] - Speaker 1
Okay. I'm going to start with Amazon. I love Amazon and they've changed this up a little bit from my training. I do have a blog post that you can reference while you are actually doing this whole process with the worksheets and everything so that can help you stay on track. And here's where Amazon is so amazing.

[00:15:52.870] - Speaker 1
So you'll see here what you used to do is you used to put your cursor in here and then just hit the enter without adding anything to search, but it doesn't do that anymore. It's a little bit different. You can see these are some of, like outdoor recreation, Amazon business, sports, and fitness. If you're in sports and fitness or outdoor recreation. If it's shown at the top of Amazon, that's a good sign.

[00:16:15.370] - Speaker 1
That means that it's popular. But you can come over here to all and you can shop by Department and so you can look here beauty and health. Maybe you want to be a beauty blogger, but I'm going to go outdoors since we already see that that's profitable. I'm going to go camping and hiking here. You hit camping and hiking and you come in here and you can see some of the most popular topics, like tents and shelters, camp, sleep, camp, kitchen, camp furniture, apparel, hydration and filtration, hiking, and backpacks, footwear.

[00:16:49.450] - Speaker 1
All that good stuff. If you go in here further, you're going to see that you could be selling some of these things.

[00:16:59.230] - Speaker 1
This is how people in that niche make money. They are Amazon affiliates or affiliates of other programs, and they write blog posts or product reviews. Or you could be writing about how to camp as a beginner. And you can add links to these things in your blog. And you could do affiliate marketing.

[00:17:19.150] - Speaker 1
So you see there and you can really even sometimes go down the rabbit hole. It's not allowing me to do it as much as it used to. So you'll see outdoor recreation. These are even more popular topics, so you can go cycling. So you want to talk about cycling only.

[00:17:37.090] - Speaker 1
So you can see there's a whole bunch of things that you can write about. Bike accessories, adult bikes, youth bikes, trailers. There's so much here. So outdoor recreation is a pretty big thing. Let me just see if I can look at something else different just to show you how about home and garden.

[00:18:00.110] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of popular blogs that are gardeners or even the home setting. Blogs are really popular, too. So let's get a garden and outdoor and see once again, here you go. Plant seeds and bulbs, patio furniture, patio seating. All of this shows you that gardening is popular.

[00:18:19.490] - Speaker 1
There are a lot of products out there for it, and you can really see that that is absolutely true. These are some of the products you can be an affiliate for. So I'm going to show you even just how to use Google too. So we're going to go camping and I'm going to type camping in. And so you can see what I really want you to look at here.

[00:18:42.770] - Speaker 1
This is where you're going to probably find some of your competitors, like recreation. Gov. But these are some of the big ones. Koa is a big one in that niche. Also, Rei, I'm going to say camping for beginners.

[00:19:03.290] - Speaker 1
Let's do that. There you go. So there's Rei and you can even get topic ideas from here too. Plus, you can use a keyword tool like Key Search and plugins like, you can take this URL and I'll pop over here into Key Search and show you real quick. I love key search.

[00:19:26.210] - Speaker 1
It's an inexpensive keyword research tool. It's awesome. So I think it's under Explorer.

[00:19:34.130] - Speaker 1
It's a competitive analysis. There we go. Organic keywords. You can type that is right here and just type on that specific page and then you're going to see all the keywords that they are ranking for that specific page. There's a ton.

[00:19:50.330] - Speaker 1
So that's a good way to get some keywords for you too, for your articles while you're doing this. But let's go back to Rei so you can see. And this is another way you can look at some of these blog posts and some of these websites. They are likely going to be your competitors. This woman seems she's actually up there on top, which is really good, and she seems to be just a normal blogger, not like Koa or Rei, which is really cool.

[00:20:21.950] - Speaker 1
So these are some of your competitors most likely. And then you can look through blog posts. How is she making money? And she likely has affiliate stuff in here. You see, she has affiliate links.

[00:20:35.450] - Speaker 1
Sorry, my computer is being slow. You'll see. So that's just an example using Amazon and Google, which are both really super helpful tools.

[00:20:50.070] - Speaker 1
I'm going to do the Keyword planner, which this sometimes finding the Google Ads keyword planner can be a bit of a pain. You may need to sign in, and this is Ads. Google. Comhomettools keyword planner, but you should actually be able to type that in Google and pull it up and you'll probably end up on a page like this and you would go to Keyword Planner.

[00:21:22.330] - Speaker 1
It's thinking and taking us along.

[00:21:26.830] - Speaker 1
Discovering new keywords is where you want to go. And some people teach using this Keyword planner for the topics on your blog. Say, I'm a freelance writer, but you can pick topics similar to that you want to write around. That all work together. So for instance, my three main topics are freelancing, freelance writing, and then online business tips, because of course, I started an online business.

[00:21:56.050] - Speaker 1
So those are the three categories main categories for my blog. So I could type in here and let's just keep going with camping.

[00:22:05.110] - Speaker 1
I'm just going to type in camping to start with and hit get results.

[00:22:12.170] - Speaker 1
So what's really interesting here is you can see camping that says the competition is low, which is kind of interesting, but that has 1 million to 10 million monthly views. That clearly shows you that is a popular topic. Even all of this, with 100K to 1 million pop-up tent camping gear.

[00:22:34.710] - Speaker 1
If you want to change that, I want to see if camping for Beginner shows up.

[00:22:43.210] - Speaker 1
Okay, it does. And this is still pretty decent 1000 to 10,000. But the competition is high on that keyword, which is kind of interesting because it's a little bit longer tail than camping is. But camping for beginners is a big topic. If you're in the camping niche, you're going to want to have an article about camping for Beginners.

[00:23:05.350] - Speaker 1
But you can see here camping Tips for Beginners. All of these are pretty high. There are some medium ones in here that you might want to go for. You kind of want to go for low competition or moderate. But if it's high competition, you can clearly see that it's popular.

[00:23:26.030] - Speaker 1
Let's see if there's another one that I can think of off the top of my head to show you.

[00:23:33.170] - Speaker 1
How about let me just type travel in Virginia just to see I'm just going to type something off the top of my head.

[00:23:46.890] - Speaker 1
Okay, so that's low competition, though. So see that one is still popular enough that it gets decent searches. But travel in Virginia seems to be lower competition. You can see lower spots here. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not popular, but clearly, if something has like, a million hits, that's clearly popular.

[00:24:07.290] - Speaker 1
So that gives you a few more signs. You might want to do a little more research just to make sure that traveling Virginia specifically would be a good niche. If you don't want to restrict yourself to one state, you can travel in the south or southwest or something like that. So there's a bunch of tools and there's more in my blog post. But here's another one.

[00:24:27.990] - Speaker 1
Neil Patel's, Uber suggests Camping and Camping for beginners. If it lets me. I think you're limited on your search for a free word for free searches with Ubersuggest to see that has a high search volume. It seems to be with SEO difficult for Google to rank you, but you can see here, view all the keywords and you can see the search volume so you can see how popular camping is. Just camping is a good hitch because there are so many products that you can become affiliates for.

[00:25:05.410] - Speaker 1
There are so many guides you can create. There's so much content you can create. But if you look, a lot of these are pretty competitive as far as SEO goes, as far as search engine optimization and using keywords in your blog post.

[00:25:24.350] - Speaker 1
So those are basically just some of the tools that I wanted to show you how to validate your niche with. I hope that this really helps you figure out exactly what you want to do.

[00:25:44.210] - Speaker 1
What niche is going to be best for you? It should take the stress off of you because you can tell from these topics that if it's going to be popular or not, and don't worry, just one piece of advice, don't stress too much because a niche isn't forever. If you start writing it and you hate it or you just want to change, you can change. I mean, it's easy to do. You would have to probably buy a new domain name and all that, but it's really not that hard to change a niche or even add a niche if you want to overtime.

[00:26:15.530] - Speaker 1
So I hope that was really helpful. I'll be signing out and get to pick your niche, get to validating it, and I hope that you do it soon so that you can get started and start creating that amazing content because your true audience and your true avatar are looking for you. Somebody out there needs you. They need your help. Please do not focus on what this topic has already been written on.

[00:26:45.290] - Speaker 1
You are unique. Nobody has your spin. Nobody has your experience. And so you can present it in a way that you can still find your true audience. That would be different from me are different from another blogger.

[00:27:00.650] - Speaker 1
So that's all we'll see you later. And I hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.
