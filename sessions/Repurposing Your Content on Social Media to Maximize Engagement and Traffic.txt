Hi there, Benjamin Dell here from Missinglettr. And thank you so much for taking the time to join us for this talk. At Missinglettr, we're obsessed with content distribution and in particular, how to get the most value out of each content that you publish. And so I'm particularly excited to share this talk with you today.

[00:00:33.870] - Speaker 1
Today we're going to be looking at what repurposing content is and why you should be doing it, some common mistakes and how to avoid them, a few different techniques to repurpose your content, and how to leverage influencers for your growing business.

[00:00:47.730] 
But first off, why repurposed content in the first place? Well, simply put, it's the smart thing to do.You've already spent the time and resources to develop the initial content, and so you might as well get the most use out of it as possible.

[00:01:00.930] 
Secondly, it helps more people see your content. Not everyone is interested in reading an article, listening to a podcast, or watching a video, and so ultimately, the more ways you can convert your existing content into new formats, the more likely you are to increase your audience size and in return, get more eyeballs on your product or service.

[00:01:20.130] 
And finally, repurposing content is a great way to conserve money. You've already spent the initial investment to create the original content, which makes it relatively affordable to repurpose it into new formats.

[00:01:32.310] - Speaker 1
So to kick things off, let's cover some of the common mistakes we often see. First up -  experimentation. Some of the most frequent mistakes people make when repurposing content is being afraid to try something new. An advantage of repurposing content is that it allows you to experiment with different mediums while already having the core of the content developed already. For example, if the original content was a podcast, try recreating it as an article or perhaps brief audio snippets for social media.

[00:02:01.830] - Speaker 1
Furthermore, these new forms of content allow you to increase your footprint on new social platforms that you might not already be on. But fundamentally, it's all about being comfortable experimenting with different formats. Now, while the process of repurposing content may seem intimidating at first, it's typically much easier than it sounds. One of the many roadblocks that are made during the beginning stages of repurposing content is trying to make everything perfect. It's better instead to get started and begin pushing out content than spending large amounts of time to try and create the ideal post or content.

[00:02:36.570] - Speaker 1
In fact, some of the best viral content out there is content that appears to be unpolished. I'm reminded of an advert that had a sofa or something like that in the background. A sofa had a clearly visible stain on it, and consequently, floods of comments started pouring through, noting the stain. Of course, everyone thought that they were being clever to have noticed it. Whether the stain was intentional or not, the unpolished authenticity of the content immediately grabbed people's attention. So don't get too hung up on overthinking the net outcome, if you will, and the quality of the piece of content.

[00:03:10.410] - Speaker 1
A great way to rid yourself of the problem of overthinking is to streamline the content creation process. So rather than creating and posting content as needed, maybe develop a few templates to reuse. Once you've created a few weeks of content, save time by scheduling them all at once. Now, like any other form of marketing, it's important to keep an eye on the results that you're seeing on social media.

[00:03:33.210] - Speaker 1
Try and make time as part of your workflow to check how your social posts have performed.

[00:03:38.070] - Speaker 1
The bottom line is that if you're experimenting with different formats and approaches, you'll almost certainly see different results in terms of engagement and clicks to start getting good at spotting positive signals and trends so that you know what to do more of in the future. And perhaps the most important, though, is don't be afraid to move on from strategies that aren't as effective.

[00:03:59.670] - Speaker 1
Now that we know what not to do, let's maybe turn our attention towards what a typical repurposing process might look like. So number one, we want to begin the repurposing process by browsing through your existing content and seeing which types of content resonate the strongest with your audience.

[00:04:16.590] - Speaker 1
This will allow you to identify what type of content your audience is looking for so that you can produce more of that in the future.

[00:04:23.610] - Speaker 1
Bear in mind that based on the type of content you create, some of these questions may not apply to you, so we might want to look at things like which podcasts have the most listens, which articles got the most clicks? Do you want to dig into Google Analytics or whatever that platform happens to be for the medium that you're using?

[00:04:40.830] 
Next, you might want to familiarize yourself with the content you've chosen to repurpose, and the reason for this is that typically you'll find that you'll start repurposing content that might be a few months or perhaps even a few years old.

[00:04:53.850] - Speaker 1
Sometimes it's from last week, but quite often it's old content, so it's always good practice to familiarize yourself with that subject matter once more, go over the content again, refresh your memory about what the topic was and what was discussed within. This then allows you to move on to the next step.

[00:05:11.070] - Speaker 1
Now that we are familiar with the content, we need to give some thought to the various ways it could be repurposed. Now, this can be the most challenging, but also the most fun part of the entire process. How you go about repurposing your content will, of course, be entirely dependent on the original format.

[00:05:27.390] 
While it might seem intimidating to try and experiment with a new form of content, don't let that stifle your creativity. At this stage, it's all about generating as many different types of ideas as possible, even the ones that don't seem like they might be, or even the ones that seem like they might be a long shot.

[00:05:42.510] - Speaker 1
Rather, once you've successfully brainstormed a list of potential ways to repurpose your content, start thinking about which ones are the most valuable. It's likely that you will have developed some ideas that make the most sense given your product or service and target audience, as well as the skills at your team's disposal. Take this time, sorry, to narrow down your list about the ideas you'd like to execute first. But be sure to save the entirety of the original list to reference at a later date. You're almost certainly going to need it.

[00:06:12.390] - Speaker 1
Just because something doesn't fit within your marketing plan at this time doesn't mean it can't in the future. You might want to use tools like Trello et cetera, and other sort of tracking tools like that to keep a log of the ideas so that you can refer back to them in the future.

[00:06:28.710] 
Five. Now it's time to act on the plan that you've created. Dependent on the forms of content chosen this will, of course, vary quite widely. Now, if budget is a concern or something is out of your wheelhouse, consider outsourcing specialist content to an expert freelancer. Platforms like At Work can be a really great way to find affordable talent, and we use them almost all the time.

[00:06:50.550] 
As with any other marketing initiative, it's vital to track KPIs and the performance of this repurposed content. Some frequently included analytics to keep an eye on are the number of likes, comments, shares, and, of course, website views. Keep in mind that it might take some trial and error to nail down a repurposing strategy that works for you and your audience.

[00:07:10.650] - Speaker 1
Okay, so before we wrap up, I'd like to briefly cover influencers and how they can be leveraged to distribute your content. It's often seen as one of those sorts of silver bullets, if you will, the Holy Grail of marketing is to tap into an influencer that suddenly will just open you up to a whole audience. The truth is somewhere in between, of course. And so it's worth just bearing in mind a few kinds of details here, but let's just, first of all, look at why it's good to tap into influencer marketing in the first place.

[00:07:44.370] - Speaker 1
We just need to look at Google. It's really grown in popularity over the last three years. In fact, the Google search term for influencer marketing has grown more than 1500% in the last three years. And rightfully so, influencer marketing can be an impactful marketing tool when properly implemented. In fact, in a recent industry survey, 80% of marketers said that their influencer marketing was an effective channel.

[00:08:08.370] 
However, influencer marketing, of course, isn't always the best fit for every business. So, as we said at the beginning, try an experiment to see whether it works for you. But certain products or services, such as physical consumer goods or software tools are, of course, more likely to have a natural fit with influencer marketing as they lean more likely towards that, they're easier products for influencers to talk about, promote and showcase across their channels.

[00:08:33.090] 
Typically speaking, utilizing social media influencers is ideal for growing a social media presence. Influencers will typically have a minimum of perhaps 1000 followers, but can easily grow into the millions these followers are ideal to tap into because they likely already trust the opinion of the influencer and the product recommendations they provide.

[00:08:52.650] - Speaker 1
With such an expansive and relevant audience, these followers are likely to be genuinely curious about your product and in return, check out your website, which should increase the number of sales made.

[00:09:04.110] - Speaker 1
Now, when choosing an influencer, we'll want to examine at least three key areas, and certainly, these are the things that we like to look at. Does the influencer fit within your niche? For example, if you have an accounting platform, it might make sense to partner with a small business. Naturally, these businesses need some form of accounting software, and it's likely that they will generally use your product. It's about finding authentic fits that don't look out of the ordinary or perhaps look like a hollow paid Advertisement.

[00:09:30.750] - Speaker 1
Number two. Numbers don't always tell the whole story. Now, unfortunately, as an influencer marketing has become so popular over the last few years, there's always been an uptick in influencers using sketchy tools, and they'll use things like bots to auto, follow their accounts, and just sort of inflate the number of followers that they have. And so, before beginning a partnership, use one of the many available tools to check the account for the percentage of real followers. You might also want to ask for verified Google Analytics data if they're suggesting a specific traffic volume that is.

[00:10:03.810] - Speaker 1
Number three. Popular social media platforms, particularly Instagram, reward users that have an active engagement rate. So when looking through their recent posts, you might want to take note of the number of likes and comments that the posts have received and always click on a few accounts to make sure that they are real accounts. As we saw before, bots are prevalent and can really get in the way of seeing what the true story is.

[00:10:25.230] 
So you found one or perhaps several influencers that you're interested in working with. Now it's time to get to work.

[00:10:31.170] 
Before beginning any work, though let's jump on a call to discuss any questions with the influencer to make sure that you have worked out what their recommended content strategy might look like. Typically, they will already know what their audience likes, and so it's really powerful and important to tap into that. And dependent on the influencer, it's likely that they might also have a menu of different services to choose from. And again, as a way of tapping into what they feel has worked well for others in the past. That might be a sort of useful corpus of information to tap into as well for advice. It also gives you a sense of some of the additional services that you might want to make use of in the future. Also, of course, take some time to review their work and services and then follow up to create a plan with them.

[00:11:17.850] 
Make sure that both parties are on the same page and that expectations have been clearly established. And, once the work is created by them, always be sure to see the content prior to publication. The last thing you want to do is to see inaccurate or false information about your product being conveyed to the public. Remember, it's your brand on the line.

[00:11:37.170]
