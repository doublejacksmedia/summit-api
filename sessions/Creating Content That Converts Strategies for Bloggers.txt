Heather Ritchie [00:00:12]:
Hey, y'all. And welcome to this presentation on creating content that converts strategies for bloggers. I know we've all been there. You know, we put our heart and soul into content, and then it seems to fall flat or nobody's engaging. And you're like, what am I gonna do if I can't create content that converts? And it's a never ending overwhelming cycle, isn't it? Well, I'm gonna help you with some of that with my special framework. But first, if you don't know me, my name is Heather Ritchie. I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer, and AI specialist. So I just I create content for clients.

Heather Ritchie [00:00:50]:
Every day I create content. I love it. But even for me, it can be overwhelming when you have emails and blog posts and social media posts and everything that you need to do. So we're gonna give you a framework that can help you walk you through the process, and let's dive in. So first, what you're gonna learn is you're gonna learn how they like, analyze and compile audience insights so that you can create content actually connects and converts and makes you money. We're gonna also talk about setting clear, measurable goals that we're gonna drive your success. And then I also wanna talk about mapping out content strategies that are aligned with what your audience wants and needs, whatever preferences and needs and challenges. And then my favorite part is building a flexible content calendar to stay consistent and on message or similar throughout all of your platforms.

Heather Ritchie [00:01:43]:
Also, I throw in using some AI tools to generate refining optimized ideas, And then we're even gonna jump in just a little bit to scheduling and tracking your content performance to maximize how it impacts people. And then adapting your content strategy in real time as new trends are coming up or anything else you wanna take advantage of or something happens and you just need a search engine. So let's talk about content challenges that blogger space. I've been blogging since 2018. I started my freelance writing business in 2017. And I have seen SEO do all kinds of crazy things over the years, and it's one of the most frustrating things to deal with as a blogger, especially with all of these Google updates. I mean, it's really disheartening when people lose half of their ad income or something because, like, the Google helpful content system update or any of those after that were supposed to help didn't. So I get it.

Heather Ritchie [00:02:42]:
It's hard, but content is the way that we sell and we're just gonna kind of flip it and maybe focus on more about being authentic and creating the content that really helps your people versus creating it for algorithms and things like that. So first of all, it's overwhelming and you may not know where to start because with so many things competing for your attention, we wear a lot of hats. You're the CEO. You're the finance director. You know, you're marketing director. Anything that you can think of, content creation strategist, all of that. So it can get really, really overwhelming. But without a clear plan, your content creation too is also gonna be chaotic and unfocused.

Heather Ritchie [00:03:23]:
You also have problems defining your audience's needs. It's often the hardest part is to pinpoint exactly what your audience wants, especially when you don't have much of an audience yet. So this leads to low engagement in sales. And unfortunately, many bloggers fit, quit, sorry, within the 1st 6 months to a year because they're not making the money they thought they would be. And sometimes it's just a slow process. I'm slower at making money online as other people were. So we all do it in our own different way, but I just don't want you to give up. It's it's reachable.

Heather Ritchie [00:03:58]:
It's achievable. You also don't set measurable goals because without specific goals, it's really hard to know what is working and what isn't much less converting your content into making money. And then there's inconsistent posting. So because you're juggling so much, posting consistently can be really hard. You're also not sure how to stand out because let's all be honest, we're afraid to be ourselves, but that is the best way that you connect with your ideal people. The more I am goofy, funny, cheery, Heather, the more people are drawn to me and I will annoy some people. That's just how it is. Be yourself.

Heather Ritchie [00:04:39]:
It really hard. It really feels hard though to find a unique angle since everything has been done before, but I promise you, you have it. You know, your stories, your experiences is there. Then there's also low engagement and conversion. So your content may get views, but maybe people aren't clicking or they're not signing up for your email list or you're not selling that digital product that you have. And then, of course, the limited resources and time. Managing content creation when you are dealing all those other things often leads to fatigue and burnout, and that's why a lot of people quit or at least temporarily quit. So I wanna introduce you to the Compass content framework.

Heather Ritchie [00:05:16]:
So the Compass framework starts with c for compiling insights and analysis. So you're really understanding your audience better. O, you're gonna set objectives and goals. M, we're gonna be mapping out strategies as a tactics. P, we're gonna be planning your content. A is for AI integration so you can optimize everything. S is for scheduling and planning for measurement, like, putting in your calendar to make sure that you're actually checking your metrics. And then we're studying and making those adjustments.

Heather Ritchie [00:05:48]:
So first, see compiling insight. 1st, you wanna understand your audience's behavior because knowing what keeps them up at night, knowing what they want and how they interact with your content is gonna help you create more of what they need and love. When you're compiling insights, you're also looking at interest and preferences. So tailing your content to your audience wants and needs, that's really gonna boost that engagement and keep them coming back for more. For instance, if your audience is busy single moms, they might like podcast content better because they can listen to it as they work around the house or drive in the car or whatever. So knowing what they want and need is really important and understanding those challenges or some people call them pain points, you really need to address those and your content and your products and services can be that solution because that builds trust and, again, positions your content as their solution and your digital products or services, whatever you have. And then also these insights are gonna help you drive conversions because you're gonna align your content with what your audience wants and needs, and that's gonna turn them into loyal fans and customers. Okay.

Heather Ritchie [00:06:57]:
Sorry. Competitive analysis. Now that I've got my brain working. So competitive analysis is when you're looking at what your competitors are doing. So you're finding the content gaps. You're either finding the gaps that your competitor isn't using so that you can take advantage of them or you're also looking at what they are doing that maybe you're not. And so you're not filling a need that your audience has. And so this allows you to, like, find those unmet audience needs and then covering the things that can help them that's not met.

Heather Ritchie [00:07:29]:
Also, understanding industry standards or niches is really important. So when you're looking at your competitors content, you can see the basics like what is their content quality? Do they post just memes, gifts? What is the frequency? You know, what are the engagement standards? So then you know if yours is on point for that niche or industry. And then really come a competitive analysis helps improve your content strategy because you're gonna learn from your competitors successes and mistakes. And then that's gonna help you over time refine how you create content. And then what's your unique angle? We all have a unique angle. Find ways to differentiate yourself. Stand out. You don't wanna blend in.

Heather Ritchie [00:08:12]:
What makes your content unique? It could be your unique insight. It could be you have a different, something that is not a popular opinion. You may have a different spin like anything. Your experiences help can help you come in. And so because I have a law enforcement background, people have told me they love that. They feel like I work hard and I have served. So that just seems to them to build trust. So there's different things that we have that kind of help us find that unique angle.

Heather Ritchie [00:08:45]:
And it's not always as hard as you think it is to find. And so with goals, I always like to do the SMART goals. So s is for specific. You wanna define a focused and clear content goal, and it needs to align with your business goals. So we're not creating content just for the sake of it sake of it. We are creating content to help our people and to make money because that's how we make money. So if you're aligning your business goals and you're creating the content, so if you wanna say focus on affiliate marketing and quarter 4, then your content is gonna be geared toward that versus launching a membership in January. It's completely different.

Heather Ritchie [00:09:26]:
So just keep that in mind with what you're working on in your business and needs to align with your content goals. So typical goals can be like increasing conversions, freebie sign ups, more engagement, you know, more traffic, whatever it is. Then you also wanna make them measurable. So you need to set metrics so that you can see if you're on track or not. Because if you just say, I wanna make more money in quarter 4, well, if we don't have anything to benchmark by, we we can't create those objectives along the way to see if you're going to meet your goals. So for instance, an example would be, I wanna make 20% more income in this q 4 than last year. So I can look at last year's numbers and say, 20% more is this. If I have not made this by December 31st, I haven't met my goal.

Heather Ritchie [00:10:14]:
Does that make sense? And then achievable. They must be realistic, but you still need it to be a stretch. So you don't wanna say my income goal is $200 a month. I mean, that's good if you're just starting and you're getting $200 a month. Don't don't don't think that that is a bad thing. It's just can you stretch yourself a little bit more? Can you say $500, a $1000? But then it also needs to be, again, achievable because if you're starting blogging or even if you're in your 2nd year and you're like, I'm making 6 figures this year. That might not be achievable and then that's gonna make you feel down and feel like you suck and that you can't do anything right. And so we don't want that.

Heather Ritchie [00:10:54]:
So it must be a stretch but something you can definitely achieve. And then relevant. This is where I said you should align your goals with the broader ones for your business. And I see I have a mess up on my slide, which is kind of typical for me. So see, I'm showing my real stuff. I make I make mistakes. This is real time problems. So it should be relevant, aligned with your business goals and then time bound.

Heather Ritchie [00:11:15]:
So basically, you're saying a time frame. So with this goal, I wanna make 20% more income in this q 4 than last year. So your goal is to meet that 20% more by December 31st. That's the time bound part. Otherwise, you again, you'll just keep going and going and never reaching into your goal because you didn't set a number. And then mapping out content strategy. So this 1st, we're gonna talk about aligning things and topics with search trends and audience needs. So first, of course, you wanna address your audience needs.

Heather Ritchie [00:11:49]:
Choose topics or things related to what they're interested in or the challenge that they are facing. So that's gonna increase relevance for them and they'll engage more. You also want them to support your long term goals though. So pick topics and things that align with those broader business goals to keep your strategy more impactful and focused. So for instance, a lot of my stuff is content creation, but if I am launching my content planning 101 course in January, then for a month before that or more, even more if you can do it. I'm gonna wanna start educating people on content planning and why it's not what they think it is and how it really helps your business and can really blow the roof off of it and all of that good stuff. And then I'm priming people for when it's released. They're like, oh, when it launches or like, this is what I need.

Heather Ritchie [00:12:37]:
So that's why pre launch is always so important. So just keep in mind that you're creating content based on what you're promoting a lot of times. And then you also wanna research search trends. So looking for trending topics or even keywords that you can use can make you more discoverable on search engines. One thing I jumped on was the AI bandwagon quick, and so I create custom GPTs. I've been using AI for about 2 years now, and I use it every single day. So that's something that came up that was not in my original content strategy 2 years ago. And so I had to switch things around or even last year.

Heather Ritchie [00:13:12]:
So I had to switch this year's around if that makes sense because I wanted to meet that opportunity and actually take advantage of it. And then choosing formats and channels that are gonna maximize engagement. So where does your audience hang out? You want to focus on their preferred platforms. So whether that's Facebook, blogs, email, whatever it is. So for example, middle aged CEOs, if that's your audience, they're gonna be more likely to be on LinkedIn. But if you are a female crafter, you're probably gonna be a more on Instagram or Pinterest. So it's just really knowing where your people hang out. And then repurposing is your friend.

Heather Ritchie [00:13:54]:
Write an email and then basically repurpose that email into your social post or into, a YouTube video into a content series that you can do on your blog, any of that. So you can start and then repurpose it for different platforms. And then we also want to create content formats that have the most impact. So things like interactive content and video, they really capture your audience's attention and increase engagement. So if you have a quiz for somebody to fill out, think how fun that is for you to fill out a quiz. Or if you do polls on Instagram or something like that. So those are the things that you want engagement. You wanna do fun stuff because if it's fun for you, it's fun for your audience.

Heather Ritchie [00:14:39]:
And then building a flexible content calendar for consistency. So number 1, make a plan for consistent posting. A plan and a content calendar are gonna keep you on track and they help build that audience trust and anticipation. If they know you come out with a blog post every Wednesday, they're gonna be anticipating that. And also keep promotions and seasonal content in mind. Plan your content around those audience needs launches and seasonal events throughout the year. So clearly Black Friday, we're gonna have a lot of Black Friday content coming out right now and you wanna get in front of your ideal audience because Black Friday is crazy and everybody is selling. So keep those things in mind and then the content that you're creating is like related what I'm creating now is related to my Black Friday offer.

Heather Ritchie [00:15:25]:
What I'll create in January is gonna be related to whatever I launched then. So just keep that in mind and then the seasons because if you work if you have like, if you're in the parenting niche or something like that, then the holidays are gonna be really big for you. So you can turn your content around even if you do business topics into something seasonal. For instance, I wrote a post on how to focus at work basically when everybody's home during the holidays. So that was very seasonal but also business related. And then you do want to allow for flexibility because this is key That flexibility allows you to adjust in real time and you can also respond to any audience feedback, trending topics or events. A lot of times, I sometimes don't know I'm gonna be in a bundle the next month. A lot of people plan ahead, same with summits, but I wanna be able to take advantage of those.

Heather Ritchie [00:16:19]:
So I may have to move my content plan around a little bit, which is why I love Trello so much because you need to just move things around. And then planning your content. You know, you're gonna inventory what you have brainstorm and prioritize. What existing content do you have? Can you identify what has the most engagement or the most traffic and then update it or reuse it to save time, like, repurpose it? You can also leverage that top performing content by refresh refreshing and repurposing your videos, emails, blog posts, everything. Because that can reinforce your messaging and that re purposing excuse me. Repurposing can help you reach newer audiences too. We also wanna prioritize maximum impact. So focus on that content that aligns with the current trends for upcoming promotions, any themes.

Heather Ritchie [00:17:09]:
And again, that's gonna be for relevance and engagement. So with AI being a current trend right now, I just launched a $9 mini course that really sold well, and it was AI content planning. So it's little things like that that just really, really help you out. And if you guys can hear my cat scratching in the background, I'm sorry. He's mad because the window's down. And then you also wanna use AI to save time. I know people are like, AI takes creativity out of it. No, it doesn't.

Heather Ritchie [00:17:40]:
It makes it better. Tools like ChatGPT can actually help you come up with more content ideas that you probably would have never thought of on your own, and it can specify them to your promotions and themes. And then, basically, you're gonna get inspired and have even more ideas, if that makes sense. So I use AI a lot for ideation and writing outlines. So we're talking about integrating AI in. So you wanna identify your audience's challenges using AI. This has gotten really easy. Now AI can analyze audience feedback and trends to reveal their challenges and what can guide your content creation.

Heather Ritchie [00:18:16]:
You can even ask ChatGPT to tell you more about your audience. And, of course, we talked about this in the previous slide, generate new ideas. AI can help you brainstorm content ideas and then you it's really good for repurposing to different platforms. And then it can help with repurposing and optimizing your content. So ChatGPT and some other tools can actually help you freshen up your content or give you suggestions on how to refresh it, how to adapt it to different platforms in different formats. So it's very helpful in those things. And it's a good troubleshooter if you're having, like, a WordPress problem or something like that. Ask chat gpt.

Heather Ritchie [00:18:56]:
It can also help you identify content gaps. So it can you can have it analyzed, like maybe if your competitor has a blog page, you can put that into chat GPT and say, hey. Can you identify any content gaps here that my competitors are missing? And then what insights are you getting and how can I use that with my own content? And then scheduling and planning for measurement. So this is basically ad checking your KPIs or key performance indicators into your calendar. Schedule those regular checks of your key performance indicators like the shares, click dues, and all of that. And then track in real time, like use real time data to make decisions. You may wanna spin to another topic. You may find that you're getting absolutely no engagement and so you may want to ask AI or something like this is what's happening.

Heather Ritchie [00:19:46]:
What's popular right now or what can I focus on that's gonna make that's gonna attract more of my people? And then you always wanna be continually improving your content. All of us look back to a month ago, a year ago, 2 years ago to content and we cringe because we're like, oh, that was so horrible. But that being said, that helps you grow and you go through that and you need to get those experiences. So always be using data because when you assume things you're often wrong. So use data to actually make decisions. And then this is the studying for adjustment. So, basically, analyze what is working in your content strategy. So review those metrics.

Heather Ritchie [00:20:26]:
What content performed well? Maybe there's some trends and preferences that you didn't see, and you can even run that through. Like, you can tell chat GPT here are my numbers. Can you help me analyze this? And it's really good at that. And then using those insights, you wanna refine your strategy. So what did you discover with all of your metrics and the content that you're creating? This is gonna allow you to focus on meeting your people's needs and what drives those conversions so you can do more of what's working and eliminate what is not. And then, of course, adapt your content in real time. So because of this flexibility, Compass' framework allows you to adjust based on any new data so that your content strategy is always relevant and it's always effective, stays up to date. So at the end of the month, quarter, or year, I think that you should plan your main launches and promotions for the next time frame.

Heather Ritchie [00:21:24]:
If you're just starting, maybe do a month at a time, even a quarter, and you wanna plan your content around those things that you're promoting, whether it's your own offers or affiliate, whatever it is, so that it educates your audiences and sets those products and services up as a solution like we have said. And let me exit out because I wanna show you my some of my content planning Trello boards. So this is my yearly content planning Trello board. And so this is an example of I'll go through here. This is a blank one. But at the end of December or the beginning of January, I'll try to map out my promotions. But keeping it flexible allows me to move these cards around in case I wanna change something because I didn't know I'd be doing all these AI resources this year. So I had to switch some other things around that weren't as important as staying on that trend because that's helping me make money right now.

Heather Ritchie [00:22:19]:
That makes sense. So I absolutely love this. It goes through the whole year and I just think it's fun. You can also add the different types of content for, each platform that you wanna use. There's also I can see it better here. I have a quarterly Trello board and then I have I'm probably missing it. There it is. My monthly content planning Trello board.

Heather Ritchie [00:22:47]:
So if you just wanna focus on a month, you can do the you can do it all in one list or you could do a different list for each week. You can put your goals here, your content ideas. I also, which I love, have what I call a content creation idea vault if I can find there it is. So this is my content creation idea vault where any idea I get, even if I'm on the go because I have the Trello app, I can pop it right in here. So I have everything from how to content ideas, personal experiences, and you don't see anything because these are my templates actually that I sell. But, you know, I have freebie ideas, newsletter ideas, products and surveys, quick tip, seasonal, all of this. It goes on and on and on So that when I'm thinking of something, I'll be like, oh, yeah. I really wanna do a roundup post on these 25 best websites to find freelance jobs.

Heather Ritchie [00:23:40]:
That makes sense. So this is something that really helps me stay on track and then I have a a solid content creation system. Let's see if I can. I do not like when that pops up. Okay. We'll go back in. So I also wanna briefly mention the content the compass content life cycle. So this is basically a cycle that's like never ending.

Heather Ritchie [00:24:09]:
You gather insights by deep diving into your audience's challenge and needs and goals and all of that, And that's gonna inform how you create content and your strategy. Then you're gonna plan and execute that strategically. You're gonna match your business goals with your content goals and bill it really be strategic with the content you create. Map out your channels, your format, your topics. If you haven't done this yet, a lot of us have like our basic content pillars that we talk about. You know, align, think of what you want to launch, think of what you want to promote, and then align all of that. Like you may quarter 4 is a big time for people buying. So affiliate stuff, your own products, and you know, it's a big time to make money.

Heather Ritchie [00:24:55]:
So this is what I'm focusing on in this quarter. And then of course, track and adjust. So pay attention to those metrics, what's working, what's not, and then adjust it in real time. And then, of course, you always wanna be making better content and improving it. So with the Compass framework, each content cycle builds on the previous one. So it is a continuous loop, but you're adding in data so that you can make better decisions and then really get into the mind of your people so that you can create content they love and that they buy from you. So I did wanna say I have actually created a PDF for you that walks you through. It's a guide of the Compass framework.

Heather Ritchie [00:25:36]:
So I'm so excited for you to have this. I created specifically because this framework is one that I talk about some of my other courses. So do not forget to sign up for this. It should be below the bottom. Again, it's going to walk you through everything that we talked about basically in this presentation. And I really hope that you've picked up some gold nuggets and that you are gonna feel so much more confident about the content that you create. So thank you for being here. It's been amazing.

Heather Ritchie [00:26:07]:
And, yeah, I'll see you next time.
