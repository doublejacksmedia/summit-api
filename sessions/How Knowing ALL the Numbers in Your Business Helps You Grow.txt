Hello and welcome to this session on how knowing all of the numbers in your business can actually help you grow your business. We're going to dive into what these numbers mean and how it's would actually helps you continue to grow your business. So, let's get started with who am I? I am an accountant. I started studying accounting when I was in 10th grade in high school.

[00:00:39.440] - Clarissa
I just fell in love with accounting. I've always been a numbers person. I mean I say the spreadsheets are one of my love languages. I just love spreadsheets. I have spreadsheets for everything.

[00:00:53.730] - Clarissa
I also spent six years as a government tax auditor. While I was in college, I really thought that being a government auditor was something I really wanted to do. Then I got the job. I ended up hating the job because I hate how the government treats small businesses.

[00:01:11.370] - Clarissa
I was tasked with having to go into a small business, audit this business, and purposely find the mistakes that these business owners were making in their business. And then I had to assess fines and fees to all of these business owners that I was auditing for all these mistakes that I was finding. And I didn't exactly enjoy it because I would much rather be teaching small business owners how to do it correctly, which is what I do now in my business, nerdy number lovers. I teach you guys how to do it correctly, and I also help you do it correctly.

[00:01:50.190] - Clarissa
So, like I said, spreadsheets are one of my love languages. I have spreadsheets for everything and I even have a spreadsheet for you guys today.

[00:01:59.070] - Clarissa
So, let's talk a little bit about who you are. So, I know that you are a passionate business owner and you absolutely love what you do in your business. But you are not a fan of doing the accounting, the bookkeeping or the taxes. Little hint, almost nobody likes the taxes, even I don't. So, you're not alone in that part. But the accounting and the bookkeeping.

[00:02:25.540] - Clarissa
It's part of being a business owner. And when you have to think about dealing with the numbers in your business, it just gives you a headache and you avoid it and you procrastinate and you put it off until as long as you possibly can. Now, maybe you've worked with other accounting professionals in your business, but you've been judged for what you do in your business. You talk to accountants and other financial professionals. The discussions that you have with these people are just over your head.

[00:02:55.870] - Clarissa
You have no idea what they're saying. You don't understand what they're saying, and you might even feel like you have to go get an accounting degree. Just to be able to understand the accounting in your business. Well, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to. You can understand the accounting in your business and you really don't need to be a numbers person. Like I said, spreadsheets are my favorite thing.

[00:03:27.750] - Clarissa
I love being able to create a spreadsheet where you can literally just plug in a number and it'll give you the answer that you're looking for, and that's along the lines of what I have for you today with the spreadsheet that I'm giving you.

[00:03:44.710] - Clarissa
So, what is the most important number that you need to know in your business? Is it your total revenue, your total sales that you bring in your business? Is it your expenses, your profit, your return on investment, the number of customers you have, the number of followers that you have on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, on any of those? Is that how much tax you owe or how much you don't owe? Your email list size, the bank account balance that you have? So, what do you think is the most important number out of this list?

[00:04:19.810] - Clarissa
And in my personal opinion, the most important number that you need to know in your business is your profit, which is your revenue minus your expenses.

[00:04:33.050] - Clarissa
When you have a profit in your business, it means that your business is actually making more money than you're spending.

[00:04:48.090] - Clarissa
So, is your business actually healthy? Like I said, profit is the main indicator here, not the balance in your bank account. So many of the entrepreneurs that I have personally worked with, they go by the balance in their bank account. Is there enough money in my bank account to buy this course? Is there enough money in my bank account to join this mastermind or hire this coach or hire this assistant?

[00:05:16.110] - Clarissa
They go by the bank balance. That bank balance is not your profit. And it doesn't tell you whether you have enough money in your business to pay all of the bills that you have coming in. That's where a budget comes in is planning for those bills that are coming in on a regular basis. And like I said, the profit is your revenue, which is the total sales minus your expenses, which is the money that you pay out to run your business gives you the profit. And that profit is what tells you whether you have a healthy business or not.

[00:05:56.130] - Clarissa
Now, some of you are going to say, but I don't really want to profit because I pay taxes on the profit. If you have a $20,000 profit in your business, you're paying taxes on the $20,000. Little side note here, that profit in your business that you pay tax on is one of the biggest differences of working for yourself versus working a W two job. When you work a W two job, you're paying taxes on the total amount of money that you are paid. Whereas in your business, you get to take the total amount of money you're paid and subtract your expenses.

[00:06:35.150] - Clarissa
That's why you're only taxed on your profit, which is the revenue minus your expenses.

[00:06:43.270] - Clarissa
So, knowing if your business is actually healthy or not and having a profit will help you to figure out more ways that you can continue to bring more money in. It'll help you have more money in your business to be able to continue to grow your business because there are things that you're going to have to buy to continue to grow your business. Maybe you're going to have to hire a coach. Maybe you're going to have to buy another course that teaches you specifically what you're looking for.

[00:07:15.890] - Clarissa
Or maybe you're going to have to pay by advertising.

[00:07:20.830] - Clarissa
So you need that extra profit to be able to continue to grow. That's part of why you need a profit. But the other thing is you have to have a profit in your business to prove that you are a legitimate business. When you start your business, you have five years for your business. This is according to the IRS, for your business to be considered a business.

[00:07:52.630] - Clarissa
Three of those five years, you should have a profit in your business. If you continue to have a loss after a loss, after a loss that will usually flag an audit. And you may have expenses that are going to get denied, and then you will have to pay tax on what is being denied. Yes, I have been an auditor where I denied expenses that they were trying to claim.

[00:08:25.690] - Clarissa
Now it wasn't exactly my choice. It was what I had to do. So, it really depends like you need to have that profit in your business to continue to grow your business, to prove to the IRS that you are an actual business and you're not just bringing in some money and then spending even more money than what you're bringing in. Because that's the other thing. You don't want to be spending more money than what you are bringing in.

[00:08:53.230] - Clarissa
So, how do you find these important numbers? Like I said, it's your revenue minus your profit. So, when you do your bookkeeping. But again, this is something where most people hate doing this. They hate doing their bookkeeping.

[00:09:08.770] - Clarissa
It's something you're going to ignore and you're going to procrastinate and you're going to just put it off and put it off and put it off because it's not something you enjoy. I get that. You don't have to enjoy it. But you are a business owner, and it is one of the most important things that you need to do in your business to continue to grow your business. Because if you're not doing your bookkeeping, then you're not going to be able to find out what your actual profit is. Because your bookkeeping is taking all of the transactions that happened in your business.

[00:09:45.710] - Clarissa
So, whether it's on your credit card, whether it's on your bank account, it's taking all of those transactions, and it is categorizing them into what we call a chart of accounts, which is literally just the accounts where you have names for what they are.

[00:10:03.780] - Clarissa
So, your revenue, your specific expenses, things like office expenses, advertising, payroll, virtual assistance, accounting, legal. All of those things are just accounts that are in your chart of accounts in your bookkeeping, and you sort all of your transactions into the account for what they are. And that tells you what you are spending in each one of these accounts. And it's something that you can continue to look at and analyze. Again, a word that most people don't like.

[00:10:41.940] - Clarissa
They don't like that word analyzed, but it's part of being a business owner. And that's how you continue to grow your business because you can't just fly by the seat of your pants. You can't just go with the balance in your bank account to say, oh, I have enough money. I can invest in that course when, so you invest in a course that costs $1,000.

[00:11:05.920] - Clarissa
And then two days later you get an invoice because you completely forgot about this invoice that's for $1,500. And now you only have $200 sitting in your bank account because you just bought this $1,000 course. So, It's things to think about. It's, things that need to be done in your business, whether you like it or not. And the other thing is, if you really, really don't like it, you cannot stand doing it.

[00:11:34.390] - Clarissa
You can hire a bookkeeper. You can hire an accountant to help you do all of this analysis to help you do the bookkeeping and provide you with this analysis once they do your bookkeeping. Because this analysis is what tells you what your percentages are. Are you spending more money in certain accounts? Are you spending more money on courses and continuing education versus buying books and books and books or buying software? Are you buying all kinds of different software because you're like, oh, that person is using Click funnels.

[00:12:18.130] - Clarissa
I think I like Click funnels. I'm going to try Click Funnels. That person is using Deadline funnel. I'm going to try Deadline Funnel, or that person is using QuickBooks, but that person is using Zero. I'm going to try both.

[00:12:32.890] - Clarissa
So, just trying out all of these things, it adds up, especially when you try it on a trial, and then you completely forget that you have this trial and then you get billed for the full amount. But you're looking at the total balance in your bank account. You're not looking at your actual bookkeeping and seeing where you're spending your money. So, you're missing all of these transactions where money is just going out the door. And you're not even noticing that because you're not paying attention because you're ignoring the bookkeeping.

[00:13:07.270] - Clarissa
Believe me, I have seen so many people where this happens to. I have had a client who was paying for three different email providers, MailChimp, Active Campaign and A Weber. They were paying for all three of them. They weren't even using a single one of them.

[00:13:27.710] - Clarissa
It all just depends on how much you're paying attention because again, this is where analysis comes in. This is where the bookkeeping comes in. Seeing what's going in and out of your business instead of just looking at the bank account.

[00:13:51.750] - Clarissa
So, when we do our bookkeeping and we actually begin to know these numbers, how does that actually help you grow your business? So, we're going back to the analysis here. It starts with doing this analysis. So, you can create your own spreadsheet. You can find spreadsheets out there.

[00:14:10.730] - Clarissa
Some of the bookkeeping software will give you some of this information as well, where you can plug in your numbers. Look at percentages. So, a couple of percentages are going to want to look at. Are you making more money this month compared to last month?

[00:14:29.680] - Clarissa
Are you making more money this month compared to the same month last year? Are you making more money from January to June of this year as compared to January to June of last year? Or what about the full year of this year compared to the full year of last year? Did you make more money? Did you spend more money?

[00:14:54.020] - Clarissa
Did you spend more money in certain categories? Are you buying more courses, more continuing education? Are you buying things that you're not even using again, this is where getting those trials and then ending up not even using it. But completely forgetting about it and then being billed month after month for it.

[00:15:20.890] - Clarissa
Are you buying software that you're really not even using? I know most of us are guilty of this. Like you get that FOMO, and you're like, I want to try that software out, so you try it out. You're like, I'm only going to try it for a month. You end up trying it for three days, then you completely forget about it because you get so busy doing something else in your business.

[00:15:43.400] - Clarissa
So, you completely forget about that software. And then four months down the road, you've paid for the software for every single month. But you haven't used it at once. Or what about all the books that you're buying? Buying all these books, whether they're Kindle books, they're physical books, they're audible books.

[00:16:02.290] - Clarissa
You're buying all of these books. Are you actually reading them? And if you are reading them, are they actually helping you in your business? These are all things that you need to think about and look at when you are doing your bookkeeping, when you are going through your expenses. These are all things that you can think about.

[00:16:26.080] - Clarissa
So, here's the thing, bookkeeping helps you see the past, so you can see what has happened in the past. But you take those numbers from the past for what you have done, and it helps you to plan the future. So, what I mean by this? So, on a regular basis, you bring in $1,000 a month in your business.

[00:16:52.120] - Clarissa
Okay. You already know that you are regularly bringing in $1,000 in your business, and then you are spending $250 in your business and this $250 goes to your email provider. It goes to your website hosting and it goes to let's go with Canva. So, you pay for Canva to put things out to create your images for your business. Everything else that you use in your business currently is free. But you're paying for your email provider.

[00:17:30.910] - Clarissa
You're paying for website hosting and you're paying for Canva. That total is about $250 a month. You're bringing in $1,000. So, you have $750 in profit right there. That's what you did last month.

[00:17:48.500] - Clarissa
So, you can take those numbers and you can start to plan for the future. So, you know that you have that $250 that you're paying every month for your email provider, for your website hosting, and for Canva. Okay, now maybe you need to start paying yourself a salary. How much do you need to pay yourself? You can add that in to those expenses.

[00:18:15.910] - Clarissa
Is it going to be more than $750? So, you have to start bringing in more than $1,000. You have to start putting more things out there to sell to bring more money in.

[00:18:29.810] - Clarissa
What about when you put more stuff out there? Is your email that's going to grow so that now you have to pay more money for your email list provider.

[00:18:40.590] - Clarissa
Or maybe you're going to there's this course that's coming out that will help you grow your email list. And you really, really want this course. Put that in your plans for expenses. So, you have the money to buy this course. Same thing with planning for taxes.

[00:19:04.650] - Clarissa
Like I said, you pay tax on the profit. So, in this case, our profit is $750. That is what you will be paying tax on. When it comes to filing your tax return, yes, there's other things that go into that. We are not going to talk about that to help you lower that profit.

[00:19:23.850] - Clarissa
But when you don't want to calculate those in when you are calculating your savings for taxes. So that way you have extra money saved for tax purposes before you even have to pay the tax bill. It helps reduce that stress.

[00:19:45.810] - Clarissa
So, knowing these numbers helps you plan out what you can do in the future. You can run all kinds of different scenarios to plan these numbers out. And like I said, I have a free gift for you today, and it actually helps you plan all of this stuff. The gift I have for you is the CFO starter kit. So, what is included in the starter kit is a budget calculator.

[00:20:14.830] - Clarissa
Paying yourself calculator, a revenue goal calculator, simple service pricing calculator, a cash flow forecast planner, a compliance checklist. And there's probably a few other things that are in there that will really help you with your business. These things help you continue to grow your business. So, this budget calculator, that's what I'm explaining for. It's going to help you figure out how much money you're spending in your business, how much money you need to put aside to plan your business.

[00:20:55.110] - Clarissa
The revenue goal calculator will help you figure out how much revenue you need to bring in. Same with paying yourself. How much money do you need to pay yourself in order to meet your own personal goals? And then take that money that you're paying yourself and add that into your revenue goal as well as the expenses that you're paying in your business. And this all runs together, and you guys can get the spreadsheet for free.

[00:21:27.570] - Clarissa
It's called the CFO Starter Kit. I have created all of these spreadsheets for you. Most of them are literally just plug and play. You plug in your information where you need to, and it will spit out the numbers that you may or may not want to see. So, it all depends whether you want to see this number or not, but it helps you make sure that you're on the right track in your business and so that you're really doing what you should be doing in your business and looking at the right numbers.

[00:22:07.150] - Clarissa
So, my question for you today, what number are you going to make? It your mission to start knowing regularly in your business? Because right now, if I'm guessing correctly and I know you just like most of the other entrepreneurs that I have worked with that I have talked to, the number that you already know, even without having to do any type of calculation. You already know how much money you made in your business this month. You know how many sales you made this month.

[00:22:43.620] - Clarissa
You already know that. So, what number are you going to start knowing on a regular basis? Are you going to start paying more attention to that profit like you really should be having a healthy profit in your business? Are you going to start paying more attention to the expenses in your business? I wanna know what number are you going to make?

[00:23:11.280] - Clarissa
It your mission to start knowing regularly.
