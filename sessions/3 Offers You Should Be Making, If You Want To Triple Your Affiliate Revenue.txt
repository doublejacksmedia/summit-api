Hey, how is it going, everybody? I'm Chelsea, and I'm so happy to get to be at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit again because I got to be here last year and it was so much fun.

[00:00:23.430] - Chelsea
So, thank you, Elizabeth, for welcoming me back. I'm very honored to get to be here. And I'm really excited to get to chat about affiliate marketing because I am obsessed with it and I am really, really stoked to get to talk to you guys about affiliate marketing, why it matters, why you should do it and how it can really boost your blog income. So, that's what we're going to be talking about in this session.

[00:00:49.230] - Chelsea
And if we haven't met before, my name is Chelsea Clarke. I am a content monetization strategist, a digital investor and a business broker. I help creators learn how to monetize their content and increase their profits with affiliate marketing, digital products and funnels. I'm also a mom and a solopreneur who has scaled my blog to half a million dollars in 2020. I founded the entrepreneurship and Affiliate Marketing Blog, Herpaperroute.com, which has now grown to a school, a Podcast and a community of over thirty thousand entrepreneurs who are there to learn about how you can make more money with your content. And I also founded a boutique brokerage called Blogs for Sale.co. And that's where I help people buy and sell niche online businesses like blogs, websites, e-commerce sites, apps, Amazon, FVA businesses and more. So, if you are in the market to buy a niche website or an established online business, do come and chat with me over at Blogs for sale.co. We have a ton of really cool listings right now that you can take over.

[00:02:01.920] - Chelsea
So, before we get started, you guys have heard this before, turn off your phone, close your other tabs, go to a quiet place and get rid of any distractions, which I'm sure you already are because you are here watching this Summit already. But it is worth mentioning because we are going to cover a lot and I don't want you to miss anything. So, let's talk about what you will learn today in this session with me. So, first, we are going to talk about what is affiliate marketing and why you should make it a focus in your blogging business. We're going to talk about why your authority in your niche matters so much when it comes to making affiliate sales and what you can do to grow your authority. And, of course, we are going to talk about the three types of offers that you should make, that you should be putting your focus in so that you can get the maximum benefit from your affiliate promotions, because I want you to work smarter, not harder. And we want those passive revenue streams.

[00:03:06.090] - Chelsea
So we're going to talk about what you can do to work less and earn more. Okay, so let's get started. First up, what is affiliate marketing? So affiliate marketing in a nutshell is when you partner with a brand, they give you an affiliate link, which is a tracking link or a tracking code. You go and you share that link around. And when someone uses that link like they click it and then they go on to the partner's website and make a purchase, you get a commission for referring that sale.

[00:03:40.860] - Chelsea
So, you would spend your time going out, creating content, promoting the content, making sales, and then you get paid. Usually it's just right to your PayPal address, plain and simple.

[00:03:52.560] - Chelsea
So, once you set up your affiliate marketing business and you start promoting a proven product to the right niche, you can build a thriving, repeatable and scalable income. So, now that you know why you should start affiliate marketing and the benefits that you can get from this type of business model, let's take a quick look at some of the steps that you need to take to get started.

[00:04:14.430] - Chelsea
So the first thing I would want to mention is that you should always invest in your knowledge. While it's entirely possible to find free information on the Internet, I cannot stress enough just how much a difference it makes when you actually invest money into a mentor or a course. The learning curve can be long and steep when starting an affiliate marketing business. But learning from a mentor who has made all those mistakes and got the exact blueprint to where you want to be will shorten the time it takes you to get to success. And also free information can often be outdated and made by someone who hasn't actually had the success that they make out. So, when you invest your money into a quality affiliate marketing course or you hire a coach, it will drive you to take action, to not give up and not get set, not get upset by the setbacks that everyone may experience from time and time again.

[00:04:14.430] - Chelsea
And there are a lot of quality affiliate marketing courses out there. I have one myself. It's called the Blog Monetization Course. If you're interested in that, you can come check that out. But I'm just going to keep on rolling along.

[00:05:20.050] - Chelsea
So, now let's talk about how to make more affiliate sales. The first thing I want to mention is that if you can niche down, you will be way, way ahead, because when you reach down. You have a focus niche on your website. You talk about products that make sense with each other or a overhanging topic. You're just going to have a way easier time finding the ideal customers that are interested in those types of products that you want to promote if you can keep everything into one niche.

[00:05:53.950] - Chelsea
And before you even choose a product, I would say start thinking about what your niche is. Think about a niche that you are passionate about. You have used or at least you have some skill in that certain area because affiliate marketing works best when you choose one area to work in and you position yourself as an expert. If you try to sell anything and everything, this will not make people trust you and buy from you.

[00:06:18.580] - Chelsea
So, another thing to consider is, is there money to be made in that niche? Well, I'm an advocate for following your passions. If you're never going to make any money, you may need to think out of the box slightly. And an idea is to look into sub niches. So if your passion is sharks, for example, there might not be a lot of money to make around that topic with affiliate marketing. But maybe you could look into promoting a digital marine biology course online or some tools that marine biologists might need. This is an extreme example, but hopefully you can see what I mean. But if you want to get into the most profitable niches, these are health, wealth and relationships because everybody wants to be healthy, everybody wants to be wealthy, and everyone wants that great relationship. So, you don't have to worry about these niches being saturated as there is always going to be demand for products in these areas.

[00:07:16.750] - Chelsea
Also, even as a beginner, you can make money up against marketers with big social media followings. You just need to create an irresistible offer. My next point is to promote what you know. So, on that same note, with niching down and deciding about a niche that you want to work in, you should promote products that you really understand you've used, you know, or you have done solid research on so that you can talk about from a honest perspective.

[00:07:48.790] - Chelsea
When you talk about products that you really do know, it's a lot easier to write about and a lot easier to make sales with. And next, you should really get personal and showcase your authority, because authority is the thing that will really, really guide you and make your readers feel confident in you and trust you and trust your opinion, so that they feel confident to open up their wallets to the brands that you are recommending.

[00:08:18.340] - Chelsea
So, some ways that you can boost your authority would be, first of all, make sure that you have a professional headshot of yourself on your website. Do not put a selfie up on your sidebar where you took it yourself and it's all pixilated and like, just bad. Go do yourself a favor. Go and hire a photographer and get those professional headshots. And I don't mean the type where you're like super formal and, you know, like with a backdrop. I mean, like a life style photo shoot where you're either outside or you're at your home office or at a coffee shop- somewhere that just gives some personality to show what it is that you do and who you are. And you can, you know, showcase your style and all that good stuff. And of course, in your photos, smile, show that you're friendly and approachable and, you know, a cool, happy person. And then, of course, always include your name and talk about a little bit of personal background. And explain in anything that you're talking about. Remind people why your tips matter, why your expertise should come into play and why they should listen to you. So, that may be mentioning education that you have. You have a certain degree that makes sense for the niche that you're working in or you have some sort of awards. Or you've been able to grow tons of traffic or a huge email list or community. Or you're making six figures. Or whatever it is that shows that you are the authority in this niche. Just don't be shy, put yourself out there and show that. People want to see that and they want to be able to relate and understand where you're coming from.

[00:10:00.910] - Chelsea
And next, of course, you don't want to waste your time promoting products that pay a low commission. So make sure that whatever you're promoting, you're focusing on high paying commission affiliate programs or even better recurring commission, where you get that sale one time and then you earn a commission for every month, that that customer stays a customer of the brand.

[00:10:23.740] - Chelsea
And if you stick around until the end, I have a free gift for you to share with you that will help you with your recurring commission affiliate program. So, I will get to that in just a moment.

[00:10:34.690] - Chelsea
But first, when we're talking about what type of products you're going to want to promote, like I said, think of products that you use and love already. Those companies could be ideal for you to promote as an affiliate because you already know and believe in them. And again, look for products that have a high average sale price so that you make a good amount per sale. So, that's in addition to making sure that the brand pays you a high commission. The actual price of the product should be high, too. And you're going to want to make sure that that product has a professional sales page, because this is what the customer will see initially and you want it to be good. And now remember, whatever you decide to sell will be a reflection of you. So, make sure that you're promoting things that you really do believe in.

[00:11:19.480] - Chelsea
Okay, so let me know in the comments how do you show your authority right now? What are some things that you are already doing that help to show your audience why you know your stuff and why you are the person to listen to?

[00:11:36.760] - Chelsea
So, I think we covered the authority offer pretty well, and now I want to talk about the supporting offer. So, this is something that you would create like a digital product. You would create a passive product that educates your ideal customer about the affiliate products that you promote. This could be an online course, a membership or a resource library, something that gives your customers more information and educates them on why this product is awesome. But not just that. You're also going to use this passive product, the supporting offer, because you want to get people into it who will be interested in buying the product later.

[00:12:20.680] - Chelsea
So, you are going to use this product to show a pain point or a problem that people are having that the product will then solve. So, you want to use this as a way to educate people, but also really illustrate the pain points and the problems of what life is like without that product. So, that then once they've realized that you can explain all the benefits and reasons why the product really could solve those problems and this supporting offer, I like to do this with a webinar or a mini course.

[00:12:59.710] - Chelsea
You can even set up a course and make it free so that it's used as a lead magnet. You're just getting all of these people in and then once they're in, you can really hone in on the reasons for why the product will be really helpful. And if you have it for free, it's a lot easier to get people in. Right, because they don't have to commit to buying anything. Everybody loves free stuff.

[00:13:21.250] - Chelsea
So, using your supporting offer is a great way to make affiliate sales after.

[00:13:27.490] - Chelsea
And my third tip that I want to talk about is the monthly lunch offer. Now, this is when you set up a promotion plan system. So, you create some sort of blueprint or system for how you would promote a product, how you would have a launch as if it was your own product. But you're going to be talking about the affiliate product.

[00:13:52.450] - Chelsea
So, let's say that you're starting in January. So, on January, you are going to set up a sales page. Maybe you're going to do a webinar, you're going to have that supporting offer. You may create some lead magnets and up sells. You're going to write your sales emails, your nurture sequence. You could think up some bonuses that you may have to go with this offer. You're going to set up your checkout, your car. You might use Thrive Card or Send Owl. And you're going to set up your ads. And what you are going to do is in January, you'll have this set up, you'll have this system, and in January you are going to have a "launch" for one of your affiliate products. And you're going to use all of these things, a sales page webinar, the lead magnets, the bonuses. And for 30 days, this is what you're focusing on; this affiliate product launch.

[00:14:43.210] - Chelsea
And then maybe in February, you're going to do another launch of a different product, but you already have all of your launch items ready to go. So, you can just use the same sales page; just change the content around. It's really great. Also, if you use Elementor because you can just export the templates and then import it into another page. And that's really helpful. It's a free plugin- Elementor. And you might do another webinar. You've already got your webinar worked out what worked for the first one. So, you just recreate it and you do it again for a different product. And you literally just go through that list and every month you launch a new affiliate product. And when I say "launch", of course, you are not the owner of the product. You're an affiliate, but you are promoting it as if you would when you were launching your own products. And this is a really great way that you can create consistent income in your business because you just have that monthly launch plan. Nothing really needs to change. You just change a bit of the information in the product name. So, every month you have a different affiliate promotion to focus on and then you don't have to think about everything all at once.

[00:15:51.070] - Chelsea
But then, of course, you have done all of this work for each one. You don't want it just to go away. So, then you can repackage these launches into a mini training or a digital product that can be bought on demand afterwards.

[00:16:03.670] - Chelsea
So, after you've done that whole January launch, everything that you did, that webinar, the sales page, all that stuff, turn that into a mini course and put it up for sale in February. February, you're thinking about the next launch, so you don't have to think about what you did in January. It's just up and it's selling now for you as you're focusing on the next affiliate product.

[00:16:23.680] - Chelsea
And by the end of the year, you will have 12 really great affiliate promotions, all set up, running, working as you sleep. You are making commissions.

[00:16:36.110] - Chelsea
Now, I want to go over some action steps with you, but first I want to see if you have any questions. I will be in the chat. Well, we're live, so feel free to jump in and ask me some questions. And also, I have a Facebook group for bloggers. So come on over. It's Facebook.com/groups/herpaperroute and I'm always around there. I can answer your questions there, too.

[00:16:59.990] - Chelsea
And before we jump into our action steps, I mentioned that I want to give you a free gift. And I think that this is a great time to do it. So, I have created a really simple cheat sheet of recurring affiliate programs. It's my little black book of recurring affiliate programs that you can check out and join the ones that you like right away. They pay a recurring commission. So, you can get a copy of my list of the best recurring commission affiliate programs that you should be earning from by going to Herpaperroute.com/black and you can get that for free.

[00:17:33.980] - Chelsea
And I also want to mention that for everyone who has upgraded to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit Pro Pass, you get my premium affiliate marketing strategy eBook included with the Summit upgrade. And so, definitely go and upgrade to your Summit propolis if you haven't already.

[00:17:54.410] - Chelsea
And now lastly, let's just quickly go down a couple action steps so that you can take away what you should work on today right away.

[00:18:03.740] - Chelsea
Okay. So first, you should be joining lots of high paying affiliate programs and focusing your efforts on those programs that pay a high commission and also that the products themselves are a high enough price, that it just makes sense for you to be focusing your efforts on.

[00:18:21.620] - Chelsea
The next step is you're going to want to download my recurring affiliate programs, Freebie, and you're going to want to start thinking about your digital product that can be your supporting offer to sell your affiliate products.

[00:18:34.130] - Chelsea
And next, you're going to want to plan a launch that you can rinse and repeat to promote a different affiliate product each month.

[00:18:43.670] - Chelsea
And lastly, I just want to add this in. You should be making more offers. You can't expect to make any sales if you don't get out there and make more offers. So, don't be shy. Get out and show the world what you are promoting or why you love it, why it really has helped you and excites you and why you think it'll help someone else. Because remember, if you were coming from a place of helping and educating and not from a place of just trying to get sales, in turn, you will actually make more sales because you are actually helping people. And that should be your focus above all.

[00:19:22.040] - Chelsea
