**Transcript:**\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys, I'm really excited for this next session with Alison from Inspired Budget. I know next to nothing about Instagram. I feel like a very old millennial. So Alison, thank you so much.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:00:10]:\
Yes, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here with everyone.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:\
Yeah, I mean, you have an incredible Instagram. So can you tell us just kind of an overview of what we're gonna what we're gonna learn today?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:00:21]:\
Awesome. So what we're gonna learn today is I'm gonna give you four strategies that you can implement, hopefully starting today, so that way you can grow your following. And these are strategies that I have implemented myself. They are tested, they are proven. I've even had other people implement them. And they have seen wonderful growth in their following.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:\
Yeah, because she has just how many followers do you have?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:00:46]:\
95,000 in 2 and a half years.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:49]:\
Yeah. That's huge, guys. More than 95,000. I just like pulled her. She has a gorgeous instagram. Yeah, it's really impressive and inspiring. Okay, so let's go ahead and dig in. I'm going to let you kind of kick it off and I'll questions.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:01:05]:\
Okay. So the first thing that people always ask me is, do I really need to be posting consistently? Like, do I have to post every day? Do I have to be in my stories every day? And the answer is, I think you should be consistently posting. Just like you're going to be consistently creating content for your blog, you need to be consistently posting to your Instagram. So I post every single day and I'm in my stories every single day. And the way I do that is I batch all of my posts. I batch everything. I even sometimes will batch my stories out.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:38]:\
Okay, how do you mean you batch out? So obviously I understand batching and creating images right, for Instagram, and you can even their schedulers for that if you want. But batching stories because I don't think.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:01:51]:\
I've ever even done a story.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:54]:\
Those tend to be more videos and kind of live. Can you explain how you batch those?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:01:59]:\
Okay, so when it comes to batching my stories, what I actually do is I plan everything out. So I'll brainstorm what I'm going to talk about. Because if you've ever tried to jump into your stories, especially if it's after a long day, if you're still working regular nine to five, then you sometimes get home and you're just like, I don't even know what I want to talk about. You have nothing to talk about, then you put it off and then you start to resent and dislike Instagram. And so what I actually do, and I'll show you is I plan out things I can talk about. So I have a calendar and I literally write down like, my post ideas, my Instagram stories ideas. So I have an idea of something I can always talk about. That way if I want to talk about it. I can. And the way I sometimes batch my stories, I don't do it all the.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:02:45]:\
Time is I will actually do a.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:02:48]:\
Story, change my shirt, do another story, change my shirt, and I just save them. I download them to my phone, and then on that day, I upload them. Okay. There are places where you can pay, like, I know later, if you pay for the platform, that you can schedule your stories out. I personally don't do that because I'm cheap, so I don't want to pay for something. But it's definitely a really great way to say, like, okay, I know I'm going to have a really busy Sunday, but I want to at least show my face a couple of times. Let me record something on Friday or Saturday.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:23]:\
Can I ask a super novice question?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:03:25]:\
Sure.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:25]:\
Really got to show how little I know about Instagram.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:03:27]:\
No, it's okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:28]:\
You record your story. So you record them in the Instagram app, and you don't post them and you download them. Is that what you're saying?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:03:33]:\
Yes. So what you do is you pull up just like you're going to record a normal story, and then there's a little arrow button, and you save it. So what I actually do is because I work from home full time, but I like posting my stories in the evenings. So what I actually do is I will record my stories, caption them, download them to my phone, and later on that night, I will actually just upload them super quickly whenever people are more likely to be on the app.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:00]:\
Okay.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:04:01]:\
Got you.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:04:01]:\
Yeah. So just a little stories hack, if you will.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:05]:\
Yeah.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:04:06]:\
Okay. All right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:07]:\
So you batch your content, or you very least kind of have an editorial calendar for it, which I love the use of editorial calendar because it always gives you something. Even if something comes up that day that's more inspiring that you're going to talk about, you just then have that idea of pushed another day. You don't have to stick hardcore to your editorial calendar for anything blogging.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:04:27]:\
Exactly. And I personally batch my Instagram post seven days in advance, and I brainstorm all the content. Then I take all the pictures and do all the images at once, upload it all at once, caption it all at once. So that's what I've been doing since the beginning because I now work at home full time on my business. But I was a teacher for two years of it. And so I would do that every single Saturday during nap time. And I think that that's something that most people, it throws them off is the time that Instagram can suck out of you. But if you batch it and if you batch and you can still be consistent and it doesn't take as much time as everyone thinks it does.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:05:11]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:12]:\
So a couple of follow up questions to that a, what tool are you using batch?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:17]:\
And then B, how many posts are.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:20]:\
You doing per day?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:05:21]:\
Okay, great question. So I use later.com to batch. It was the first one I ever used, and you can schedule 30 posts for free. And I like that now. I do set it to notify me. I don't have the one where it automatically posts because I get a notification for the time I want to do it. I do one last read over for spell check because there's always something you miss, right? I do one more read over, make sure if I have a link in my bio, it's there, and then I hit publish. So I do that, and then what was the other question you asked me?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:52]:\
How many times a day you post?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:05:53]:\
Oh, I only post one time a day.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:05:55]:\
Okay.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:05:55]:\
The only time I'll post more than once a day is if I'm going through a big launch and I feel like my feed is too heavy on me talking about something I'm promoting.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:06]:\
Okay, got you.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:07]:\
Okay. But one time a day is enough. But I'm in my stories every day, and I do anywhere between ten to 15 stories a day. I think stories are honestly becoming more important because people are seeing those probably more than they're seeing the always at.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:21]:\
The top of the feed.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:22]:\
Yes. And if posting every day is overwhelming to you, then what I say is just start out with three times a.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:29]:\
Week and then move it up to.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:30]:\
Five times a week. Because I think so many people say I have to post every day. They get overwhelmed, and then they just want to quit Instagram. But the whole purpose is to build that relationship with your followers so that way you can drive them back to your blog, you can drive them back to your products, and you can ultimately, hopefully, get them off of the Instagram app and to where you want them to go.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:51]:\
Okay, so you say you do ten to 15 stories a day.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:06:56]:\
What does that look like?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:57]:\
How long are they? What like yeah.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:07:00]:\
So every story is 15 seconds. Can't be longer than 15 seconds. A lot of times I'll talk about what my post is that day. Sometimes I'll share, like, okay, so true story. Two days ago, I was just, like, in a weird mood. I just felt really gross. No. Part of me really wanted to get into my stories and interact. It wasn't what I wanted to do. And so I thought, Well, I still want to put something out there. So I linked because I do have swipe up. I linked to three of my blog posts to send them to my blog. I even just showed what I was cooking for dinner, but I didn't show my face. It just showed really quickly what I was cooking for dinner. And then I said, hey, if you're looking for new followers, here are ten people that I love, and I screenshotted I took a screenshot of ten people that I follow inside my niche that I personally enjoy their Instagram. I tagged those people, and it was great because I was offering good information to my followers, and it allowed me to be a little bit hands off that day.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:03]:\
Okay. No, I like that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:04]:\
As a good tip.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:07]:\
Swipe up. I think that's something that's available once you reach a certain number of followers.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:08:11]:\
Yes. You either have to be verified or have 10,000 followers.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:08:15]:\
Okay, got you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:17]:\
So I feel like we've covered batching. What was your second tip for growing?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:08:22]:\
So my second tip was to solve a problem for them. Like, whenever you're posting, always think about how can you solve a problem for your followers? And that might look like actually solving a problem. That's difficult for them, giving them information. It might look like inspiring them with some sort of quote and inspiration. Or it might even look like just making them smile, because people want to smile whenever they're on Instagram. They want to feel happy. They want to have a laugh. And so solving a problem and really thinking about it in that way whenever you're deciding on a caption, can be really helpful to help. It causes people to say, oh, my goodness, I want to start seeking out posts from this person. I really want to start going to their profile to see if they have anything for me. I want yes, they're helping me because I'm pretty sure most people get the blogging is they want to help. They want to help people solve people's problems. And so your Instagram can be the exact same way.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:23]:\
Okay, yeah, no, I think that's a great point, and that's true of your content, right? So maybe it's one tip on your Instagram, and then go to my blog to read more and really get this problem solved.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:09:34]:\
Yes. I personally share two blog posts a week in my Instagram. So out of seven days so it's easy sometimes when you think, okay, oh, my gosh, I have seven days of something to Batch. Well, two of the seven could be sending them back about a post or about something you want them to check out. And I'll sometimes just copy and paste the opening paragraph, and that's my caption, right? Like, if I wrote it once, it's got to be good, and then I have them go to the link in my bio, and so it helps it seem less overwhelming, and you could break.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:10]:\
It out so that it's like, okay, two days is a blog post. One day is like, a quote that I like. One day is something I'm watching this week that can tie back to my content in some way. And what I do absolutely kind of have categories that you're like, okay, this is kind of how I feel in that content. Rather than being like, what do I do.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:10:31]:\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:33]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:35]:\
I did want to just quickly ask, so what sort of link in bio do you update your link daily? Are you using, like, a link tree or something along those lines?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:10:44]:\
I do use link tree. It's what I've used from the beginning, and it works. I only update it whenever I let me see if I have an Instagram post that is leading to a blog post. I don't keep all my blog posts on there. If I mention a blog post, I'll keep, like, two or three at a time, because after a while, people don't scroll down and read anything. But I have all of my free opt Ins on there. I mentioned those. That's another thing. If you have some sort of an opt in, that could be an Instagram post that you're talking about. You talk about that in your sorts.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:19]:\
Of ideas for Instagram.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:11:21]:\
Good.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:11:23]:\
It makes me happy.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:26]:\
Okay, so moving on.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:31]:\
So we want to make sure we get to all of them, get questions answered. So what's next on the list?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:11:36]:\
So next on the list is to let them know the real you. And this is where it can be a little bit scary, because what I want to challenge you to do is to actually be vulnerable. So I have a little story that goes along with this. Whenever I first started, I was terrified of even getting in my stories. I really was. The idea of people seeing me stumble over my words was nerve wracking to me. I didn't want to appear. I wanted to appear, like, perfect in these people's eyes, which is silly. And I went outside in my backyard. I told my husband it was the weekend. I said, hey, look, I need to just go jump in my stories real quick. I'm going to talk about X, Y, and Z. I'll be gone ten minutes. I'm going to come back inside. 45 minutes later, he comes out, and he's like, what are you doing? And I was like, I can't get this right. The light's not good. This filter looks terrible. I'm stumbling over my words, and he was like, Stop. And I said, excuse me. And he was like, Stop. Just stop. Just let them know the real you. Like, if you let them know the real Allison, they'll like you, and they'll keep following along. They don't want this fake version of you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:39]:\
And I was like, there's already a lot of that.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:12:41]:\
Yeah. And I was like, oh, my gosh, she's right. And so whenever I was willing to open up and let them see the quirky bubbly side and then also see the vulnerable side, where I have talked about anxiety and depression that I've struggled with, I've talked about marriage, I've talked a little bit about kids. And I tie it all back into overcoming your goals, overcoming your trials, and dealing with your finances. It turns people into I've had people that message me that say, I feel like you're my best friend, because they feel like they really know you if you give them the opportunity. And those are the loyal people that are going to then go read your blog. Those are the loyal people that are going to sign up for your email list. They're going to be the ones that buy the course that you make. They're going to be the ones that watch the videos on the YouTube channel that you'll create one day. So I think that there's just so much people are scared to do it, but I think if you're willing to take the risk, then yeah, you might look silly every now and then, but it's so wonderful whenever you can just show up and be you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:45]:\
Okay. No, I like that, being yourself. And I think those are the like, when you hear like an Instagram story or I say story, but anything like posts, like, go viral or something, it's because someone's being so vulnerable and so open about that. Yes, I did, because you mentioned it in this one. Filters, do you tend to stick with a certain filter every time to kind of give a branded look or what?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:14:14]:\
I don't use filters at all. I don't use filters at all. Some people do. Filters don't bother me as much as they used to. I think whenever I was first starting out, I used the filter that makes your skin look really smooth and everything. And then I was like, I'm lying to my people. My skin isn't always smooth. Why am I doing this? I don't personally use filters. I don't think there's anything against them. I think, though, that when you can show up without a filter that people feel like it's more real.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:14:45]:\
Yeah.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:14:46]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:48]:\
Do you ever do any kind of certain lighting to make sure photos and they're all bright and light and beautiful?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:14:55]:\
Oh, so in my Instagram post yes, I have a set of presets for lightroom. So I do have the lightroom app I use because mine are always, like, very bright. So I want the brights to be bright, but I want the real color to come through. So for my photos inside my feed, I do use certain presets through the lightroom app and ones that I've purchased as well. And so that has made my life so much easier and I wish I had bought those years ago. They were a wonderful investment.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:28]:\
Okay, great to know.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:15:31]:\
All right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:33]:\
We talked about batching, we talked about solving a problem. We talked about being yourself and being yourself vulnerable.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:15:39]:\
Yes.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:15:40]:\
Is your fourth tip?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:15:42]:\
My fourth tip is to encourage engagement because ultimately they're on the Internet. Everyone has an opinion. Right. And I know it can be so frustrating when you have this post and you put all this time captioning it, you put all this work into it, and then you're like, no one's commenting. Like, what's going on. You think people are constantly talking on the Internet a lot of times about things that it's like people have that what is it? Whenever it's like, I'm sorry, now I'm losing my train of thought. People will say things on the Internet that they want to say to you in front of your face. Right. And so then you go on Instagram and you create this post, and you're waiting for someone to say something, and no one's saying anything. So you're like, what is going on? So my way of encouraging engagement is to always ask a question at the end of the post, because sometimes people need to be told, I want to hear from you. So if you tell a short story or you have a post and then you have a question, you can even say, let me know your answer in the comments. Like, I'll actually write that. Raise your hand in the comments if you can relate. Because people need to be told to engage. Another way that you can engage with your followers that will work tremendously, and you do not need swipe up to do it is when you're in your stories, you actually tell them, hey, you're talking about something, and you say, hey, I want your opinion. I want to know how you feel about blank. Send me a DM. The button's right down here. Send me a DM right now and let me know how you feel about blank. And what's happening is that person immediately sends you a DM. They're in your inbox. You can engage with them. You have built that relationship with them. If they have a question, you can send them a link back to your blog post where you answer something. And so you're still getting that same type of engagement. And it's honestly deeper because I truly believe that DMs are gold. Like, they are gold mine. Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:38]:\
Yeah. So it brings me to some additional questions.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:17:43]:\
Okay, sure, no problem.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:44]:\
Because DMs, I feel like, well, A, you're limited in how many DMs you can get is my understanding. But also, how do you manage that?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:17:52]:\
Wait, what do you mean you're limited?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:54]:\
And again, I could be 100% wrong because my knowledge of Instagram is like, whatever, but I think you're limited to something like 200 DMs a day, which yeah, is a lot. And that's different. Right. So how often are you checking your DMs? How often are you that do that? How do you manage your inbox?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:18:15]:\
I guess I think it depends on how many followers you have and how often you encourage engagement. So my point right now is it's a lot of work. Like, I'm not going to lie. When you have thousands upon thousands of followers and you're also encouraging engagement, you get a lot of messages. I just posted a story right now about my dog losing his leg, and I know I'm going to get lots of people's opinions and lots of people's messages. So I'm going to make sure that after I post that, that I have time to actually respond. And I even have an app. You can download an app for Mac where it goes up on your desktop so I can type and respond faster.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:18:54]:\
What app is that?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:18:55]:\
Oh, I think it's just called, like, instagram message. It's like $5, but I downloaded it and I can sit there and actually type back and respond. It's hard. I try to take 30 minutes at a time and then move on and come back to it because there are times whenever I can't possibly get to every single message, but I try my hardest. I can't possibly get to every single comment, but I try my hardest. And so it gets harder as your audience grows. But I see it as like an honor that someone's willing to reach out and take time out of their day.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:\
Yeah, to message problem, for sure.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:19:36]:\
Exactly. And so a lot of times people will message me with these super complicated questions that they're stories, and I just can't get back to them and spend all my time writing a super long response. So I'll try to send them to a blog post. So it takes commitment. I would say have some sort of a schedule set out where, okay, three nights a week for 30 minutes, I'm going to work on direct messages.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:20:01]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:02]:\
And then I also wanted to ask, how long are your captions typically?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:20:08]:\
So on my stories, stories and posts. Okay. So in my stories, I always paraphrase what I'm saying in my stories, and that takes time. There are apps where it can auto caption what you say. I personally don't like those. I did purchase one, I tried it, I didn't like it. So I personally caption my stories. It takes time. However, there are so many people that are watching their stories with their phone on silence because they're laying in bed next to a kid. They're at work and procrastinating, and there's all these people. And so I do that. In terms of my Instagram posts, I try to keep them a little bit longer. I try to have some sort of a story in there, some sort of a connection, but not all the time, but those connections, whenever you're able to really offer some sort solve a problem or make some sort of connection, it's going to be better in the long run. And when you're showing your real self and you're being vulnerable, it's not limited to just your stories. Like you can do that in your Instagram post as well.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:21:11]:\
Yeah. Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:12]:\
And then kind of the other question I wanted to ask, because I feel like it's where a lot of people get hung up and it's always hashtag.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:21:20]:\
Hashtags? Yes. Okay. So hashtags can be amazing if you can land on an Explore page. So that's the ultimate goal is you want people to find you that are not following you through hashtags. So just as like, whoever's watching this, open up your phone, go to your Explore page and type in a hashtag, right? So for instance, my niche let me do this too. If I open up Instagram and I type in, I click on tags and I just type in Budget because I talk about personal finances. Budget, it has 1.4 million posts at the time we are recording this. Okay. My chances for showing up in the Explore page for Budget, not likely, right? Because there's so many people using that hashtag. But if I type in, let's see, just Budgeting. Budgeting hashtag budgeting only has 487,000 posts. So you see, you want hashtags. You want to search for hashtags that aren't going to have millions, but are only going to have in the hundred thousand or even lower because it's going to give you a higher possibility of showing up in the Explore page for people.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:37]:\
Okay, good to know.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:22:39]:\
And so I like to look at some that are like anywhere under 500,000, maybe even like 100,000, 200,000. Another thing I recommend doing is go to someone that you admire that's in your same niche, look at their posts and see what their hashtags are. And you always want your hashtags to be relevant to what you're posting about. So I wouldn't post a picture of my kids and then write hashtag dogs, hashtag, budgeting, hashtag dogs of Instagram. I wouldn't do that. You want it to be related. So for instance, because I talk about budgeting, I use a lot of times I use the hashtag, hashtag cash envelopes. But if my picture is not about cash envelopes, and I'm not talking about cash envelopes, I will not use that.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:23:24]:\
Okay, got you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:26]:\
And how many hashtags do you typically do then? Do you max it out?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:23:31]:\
I don't usually max it out, but as many as you can think of for that post that are relevant to that post.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:23:37]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:38]:\
And when you're batching right, I assume you're coming up with your hashtag spin as well.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:23:44]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:45]:\
Do you have kind of like a running list of ones that you'll go.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:23:47]:\
Look at or what? So I have some that I use over and over and over again. I highly recommend. Okay. At one point, I copied them into a Google doc and I would just copy and paste. But the Instagram will mark that as spammy. If you're using the same hashtags just in a row, one after another, that's going to come off as spammy. So you don't want to do that. So I always do hashtag inspired budget, which is my business. And then I do some of the same ones because they are more broad. But then I really try to think, okay, what can I narrow down to? You can even start searching hashtags. If you're batching your content, then it's not that hard to search for hashtags because that's just part of your step.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:28]:\
Yeah. Okay, got you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:30]:\
No, I think that's a great point. So I think we've covered your four tips. I feel like we've covered a lot of just the release because I don't know anything, any additional kind of tips or things in terms of setting up your Bio business account versus personal account, like anything like that, that people should maybe be aware of when they're trying to get going and get more followers following your tips.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:24:54]:\
So I personally, and I don't know if there's any science or studies or anything like this, I personally like it whenever people's profile picture is their face because it allows me to directly connect with that person and I know what they look like. I prefer that over a logo. I did have a logo at a time, but I felt like when I'm scrolling through, if I see someone's face, I don't know, I'm just more likely to click on it. Also be in your pictures sometimes because people like to see who you are. They like to make that personal connection. Pictures of people's faces in them do so much better than just like stock photos. And you can make your pictures look really nice if you download some of those. If you start using the Lightroom app on your phone, I mean, you can make it look so great. In terms of your Bio, make sure you have a link in your Bio. Make sure you have your email set up in your Bio so that way that people can click on their email and email you. Because as you grow, you might even get opportunities from brands. So that way you can be a brand ambassador and get actually paid to do some work as long as it follows in with your niche and you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:06]:\
Don'T ever want to sell out because then you're going to lose those loyal people.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:09]:\
Exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:10]:\
Really solid fit exactly for you and will be helpful to your people.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:16]:\
Yes.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:17]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:18]:\
Any final words before we tell them about sort of often freebie you have for them?\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:24]:\
No. Feel free to follow me on Instagram and send me a DM if you have a question or if you need support in any way.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:34]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:35]:\
And then your Freebie is all about learning to grow your Instagram following and you're sharing how you grew Instagram from zero to 40,000 in a year.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:42]:\
Wow.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:43]:\
Do you want to tell them any more about that? Obviously the link is going to be below, but additional information they should know.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:26:50]:\
Yes. So basically every single month I'm going to send you a whole calendar with an idea for what you can post for every single day of the month. So basically before the month begins, you'll get a calendar and it'll just be filled up with post ideas and so you can take what you like and leave the rest. It's a really good way for you to kind of have someone. Else just hand over some ideas for you, and then every single week, I send helpful information, other tips and tricks, things that I've learned along the way just to help you grow your Instagram following.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:23]:\
Okay, well, I'm going to go sign up for that right now.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:27:25]:\
Yeah, that'd be great.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:27]:\
Like I said, I know nothing, and I've already learned so much to thank you so much. I really appreciate all your help. I hope everyone got a lot out of this session.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:27:34]:\
Well, thank you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:36]:\
They may be novices like me, or they're laughing at me. Either way, so much. I think this is really great information. You guys should definitely follow her on Instagram, and we'll catch you on the next session. Thank you so much.\
\
Allison Baggerly [00:27:48]:\
Okay. Thank you so much for having me. Bye.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:03]:\
You.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:05]:\
All right, guys, I'm super excited to have Anca from Social Bee joining me today. Thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:00:12]:\
Sure. Hi.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:\
Yeah, because I've been a longtime fan of Social Bee. I've been using them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:18]:\
For years, I think.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:20]:\
I honestly don't remember when I started using them, but I haven't had any cause to worry or think about that. So it's been great.\
\
Anca Pop [00:00:27]:\
Important.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:28]:\
Yeah. And so I'm really excited for you guys this session. Can you tell me a little bit about your background and just what we're.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:34]:\
Going to learn today?\
\
Anca Pop [00:00:35]:\
Sure.\
\
Anca Pop [00:00:36]:\
Well, I have a background in journalism and marketing, but here at Social Bee, I'm the customer success specialist and we try to focus all our efforts into educating the users as well as helping them along with the platform and also with some concierge services where we do the work for them if they don't have the time.\
\
Anca Pop [00:00:57]:\
And basically that's about it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:01]:\
Okay, so can you just give us some of the highlights of what we're going to learn?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:04]:\
Because I am excited for it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:06]:\
We're going to learn about repurposing content. First of all, we're going to go through what repurposing content is, how you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:14]:\
Can do it, and more specifically, how.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:16]:\
You can do that for social media. And then we're going to go into.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:20]:\
A few tips and tricks.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:21]:\
Yeah, I know you're going to be using SocialBee to show us how to do these things, so let's go ahead and dive in. But even though we're using Social, like, just the content, I'm excited for it because it's a struggle to come up with all the social media posts because they require variations and everything now.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:39]:\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:41]:\
So let's go ahead and get to it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:44]:\
Hi, everyone. I'm Anca from Social Bee and today I'm here to talk to you about how you can repurpose your content, save time, and win readers all in one go. Before I do that, though, I'd like to tell you a little bit more.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:58]:\
About SocialBee and who we are as a company.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:01]:\
We offer DOITYOURSELF social media management tools.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:05]:\
As well as done for you concierge services, which means that we can handle your social media so that you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:13]:\
Handle other aspects of your online presence. Now back to today's topic. We're going to talk about how you can extend the value of your blog posts and get more traffic to your website by doing one simple action repurposing your blog posts more in depth. We're going to go through what repurposing is, why you should repurpose your content, and more specifically, how you can do.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:40]:\
It, or rather, how you can do it for social media.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:44]:\
And then at the end, I'm also going to offer a few tips and tricks on how you can stay organized.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:50]:\
As well as how you can save.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:53]:\
Time when repurposing your content.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:55]:\
Now, before we jump in, we've all.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:59]:\
Been there where we think that we need to create new content all the time in order to get traffic to our website, right? Well, that's not necessarily the case. Creating new content all the time can be exhausting because, one, it's not easy to get fresh ideas all the time, and two, it takes a lot of time to write good content. So that's where repurposing comes in handy when you repurpose your content.\
\
Anca Pop [00:03:32]:\
So the content that you already have.\
\
Anca Pop [00:03:34]:\
You get more time to spend on articles that you want to write on, those that you need to nurture a little bit more so that you can get them just right. Basically, repurposing is a way in which you can recycle your existing blog posts into new formats, or just a way to produce more content in less time. Now, all of this gives you a lot of benefits, and that brings me to my next point why you should repurpose your content. We've chosen here a few main benefits for repurposing, but obviously these are not all of the benefits out there, so there may be others which we haven't mentioned. I'll start with telling you why repurposing helps your Return on Investment or ROI. It's because it maximizes your content or your content's value. In a way. It gets new audiences to view that content, to read it, and to engage with it. Think of it this way if you spend an amount of time and resources creating content, you want to make sure the majority of your audience, if not all of it, sees it right. That's why repurposing helps with ROI. It also helps with SEO because it helps drive more traffic to your website.\
\
Anca Pop [00:05:11]:\
Another benefit is what we call TAC.\
\
Anca Pop [00:05:15]:\
Which stands for Trust, Authority, and Consistency. Trust, because repurposing your content can offer a sense of trust from your audience, so that they trust what you're saying, which means that they're more likely to share your content more, and that also gives you more authority, which is the second point here. Authority is something that makes you more believable, and also consistency, which is very easy to do when you repurpose content. You can be consistent without having to worry that you need to write a new article right now. Now, we've also added a few other benefits, which are not acronyms fun and new. Fun, because it's fun to not be.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:11]:\
Stressed about having to create content all.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:15]:\
The time, because you know you have a backlog of content that you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:20]:\
Repurpose and reuse so that you have.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:25]:\
Consistent presence on your social media. And new, because, well, A, you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:31]:\
Find new ways to talk about topics that you've already written about, and B.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:38]:\
You can find new audiences to reach with those topics. Okay, so now that we know the benefits of repurposing content, let's go in deeper and see how you can repurpose your content.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:54]:\
Before we go into the specifics, I.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:57]:\
Want to tell you about the two.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:59]:\
Main category every blog has.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:02]:\
Category one is Evergreen content, or content that can be used throughout the year.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:08]:\
No matter the day of the week or the date or anything like that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:13]:\
It's content that is not time sensitive. It's content that is not affected by.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:19]:\
Any season or by any event.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:21]:\
It's always good to go. Such examples can be articles with lists.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:28]:\
Like Five benefits of doing a podcast, or five benefits of repurposing blog posts, for that matter.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:37]:\
And the second category is content that is time sensitive or time bound. That's also a type of content that you should work with.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:49]:\
But this is bound to an event or a time or date, so you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:07:56]:\
Shouldn't or it wouldn't make sense to share it past that date. Now, in today's webinar, we are going.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:04]:\
To focus more on Evergreen content, but anything that we say here can also apply to time sensitive content. By the way, an example of time sensitive content are news articles which are time bound and usually lose their.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:23]:\
Newsworthiness within a few days or weeks. Okay, so when you repurpose content, what.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:33]:\
You need to do is first you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:35]:\
Need to look at your existing content, separate your content into these two categories.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:41]:\
Work with the evergreen content into one category and the time sensitive content into a different category.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:49]:\
Why this is important because there are different types of content.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:53]:\
With Evergreen, you can just create an.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:57]:\
Indefinite number of ways in which you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:59]:\
Can repurpose it and you can share it again and again without worrying about anything.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:04]:\
With time sensitive content, you can repurpose it, but with one condition it has.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:10]:\
To be before the end date or.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:14]:\
The time when the content expires. Which means either the event that you're.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:19]:\
Talking about or that actual date mentioned.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:23]:\
In the article passes.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:24]:\
So if you have an event within a month from now, you do have that full month where you can repurpose your content from when you first published.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:34]:\
It, but you wouldn't want to publish.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:37]:\
That article after the event, as it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:40]:\
Wouldn't be necessarily interesting to your audience once the event has passed and they can no longer attend it. That's why we focus more on Evergreen. Now, step two once you have your.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:53]:\
Articles into these two categories, find the.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:58]:\
Best and worst performing blog posts.\
\
Anca Pop [00:10:01]:\
You can do this with tools such as Google Analytics or Facebook Insights or anything that can provide some analytics on how your blog posts are performing. You can look at traffic, you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:10:17]:\
Look at engagement, you can look at.\
\
Anca Pop [00:10:19]:\
Anything that can give relevant metrics in this sense.\
\
Anca Pop [00:10:24]:\
And what I want you to do is to first start with a top five of each. So find the top five best performing blog posts and find the top five that are worst performing for whatever reason. It does not matter at this point. What you want to do is you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:10:42]:\
Want to work with repurposing those first. And then you can go in and add more articles from your blog post as you work through them. Step three is to identify the types of content that you'll create. And here there's actually quite a few.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:00]:\
Content types that you can create.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:02]:\
You can go for podcasts, you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:04]:\
Go for white papers, infographics, videos. You can answer questions on the web.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:10]:\
On forums or quora. You can make audio versions, or you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:15]:\
Can just create newsletters.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:18]:\
Or you can create social media posts, which is the type of content that we will be focusing on today.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:27]:\
More specifically, let's see how you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:32]:\
Repurpose for social media.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:35]:\
Well, first of all, you need to look for the hooks. A hook is an actionable point in your article that can catch the interest of your audience.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:49]:\
To exemplify this, sorry, I stumbled a bit. So to showcase this, we've chosen an.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:58]:\
Article from BBC about Friends because we here at SocialBee love Friends very much and I'm sure you're familiar with this TV show already. So we have this article that we've.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:11]:\
Already downloaded into a PDF and we've.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:15]:\
Highlighted a few hooks that we can then later work with in our example.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:25]:\
First of all, we've highlighted the title of the article, which in itself is always a hook.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:33]:\
It's something that grabs the attention of.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:35]:\
Your audience and makes them want to read more about that topic. Then we also highlighted.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:46]:\
A lot more sentences or a lot more points from here from this article. But I'm not going to go through.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:52]:\
All of them because it's quite an extensive article. I'm just going to show you, for instance, this quote that Monica says to Rachel in the first episode.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:06]:\
Welcome to the real world.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:07]:\
It sucks. You're going to love it. So we have all our hooks selected. We highlighted them. So the second step into repurposing your content for social media is to transform your hooks into posts. And then obviously, the third step is to publish them.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:28]:\
Now, to transform your hooks into posts, there's quite a few ways you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:34]:\
Do that and I'm here with a few content ideas on how you can actually do that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:39]:\
The first one on my list here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:42]:\
Is pulling a meaningful quote, which is exactly what I did with the Monica quote. So I highlighted the most famous quote Monica says to Rachel in the first episode.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:55]:\
And then that's something that most Friends.\
\
Anca Pop [00:13:59]:\
Fans know and will identify very quickly. So.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:05]:\
It definitely catches the attention of your audience like that. A few other content ideas are bold statements, key takeaways, or you can just.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:17]:\
Use self explanatory images or gifs videos, anything like that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:22]:\
Or also use posts that can generate engagement, like polls or this or that, or questions.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:31]:\
But finally, you can also add, in.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:35]:\
Case you missed it, statements which basically summarize your post without giving away the full story. That means that your audience still gets.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:45]:\
Interested in the topic and wants to read more. So they do go to your website and read the full blog post to.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:53]:\
Find out the entire story there. Okay, so we have all the content.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:00]:\
Ideas, we have the hooks, we have.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:03]:\
What we want to do with the hooks to transform them into posts. So how exactly are we going to do that? Well, for each idea we need to first write captions that contain the hooks.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:16]:\
That you previously identified, use relevant visuals.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:20]:\
Around the captions, and then third, last but not least, add a clear call to action and a link back to the original post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:29]:\
This is always needed because this is.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:32]:\
The way you're going to get traffic brought back to the post from your social media. Okay, so how do you stay organized with all of that? Well, our suggestion is an editorial calendar and I have one prepared right here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:49]:\
With the Friends article that I first showed you. This is a one month editorial calendar which has a few key points.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:00]:\
Here we have the blog post title and the link for ease of access.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:05]:\
And then we have a few columns here like the text which tackles the.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:10]:\
Copy or the caption of your post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:13]:\
For instance, in the first post here, we have Joey's famous phrase, how are you doing? Which we follow up with a question.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:23]:\
Have you read our latest blog post about Friends?\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:27]:\
Then we include the call to action.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:31]:\
That is clear, find out how the series got to change so many generations all here, and then include the link so that they can actually find out.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:42]:\
What we want them to find out.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:44]:\
The second column tackles the visuals.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:47]:\
This can either be an image, a GIF, a video, or even just a link preview, which is what usually social media platforms generate when you add a link to your post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:02]:\
Basically, it's a featured image from your post as well as a small description.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:07]:\
Of what your post is about.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:09]:\
Then you also have one that's very important, the publish date.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:14]:\
This will help you keep everything organized because it spreads everything out in our.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:21]:\
Example, throughout a full month, but you can go even further if needed. And also we have a fourth column.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:29]:\
Added, which is a status so that you can have a better idea of what stage every post is at. So if you've already scheduled this post, you can just choose to set it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:45]:\
As scheduled, or if you've published it already, you can go ahead and set it to posted. And also this way you know exactly.\
\
Anca Pop [00:17:54]:\
How many posts are left to be scheduled or to be published in the future before you need to do this again.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:01]:\
Now, I'm not going to go through.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:03]:\
All of these examples because that would.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:06]:\
Take a lot of time, but let's just dissect one or two more.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:10]:\
For instance, the post number nine here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:14]:\
TV series Riddle Time, who are the six slightly clueless 20 somethings. Not sure where they were heading, but.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:23]:\
Not too worried about it either. Tap to see.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:27]:\
This is usually meant for something like.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:32]:\
Instagram, for instance, where you get to tap on the story or swipe up.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:37]:\
And go to the actual link.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:38]:\
But it can also work for Facebook.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:41]:\
Or any other platform. It basically creates engagement with the riddle, the fact that you obviously know the answer to this if you're a Friends.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:50]:\
Fan, but it's also quite fun to.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:53]:\
Answer and show everybody else that you know the answer. So that's what your audience will feel.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:00]:\
When they see a post like this. We also have a little hint for the riddle, which is the beginning of their theme song, created on a black.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:13]:\
Background, and that's about it on how.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:18]:\
You can organize your posts.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:20]:\
But this can take a lot of time.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:23]:\
So how exactly can you save even more time when doing all of this prep, especially if you're doing this for.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:33]:\
A bigger number of articles? Well, that's where Social Bee comes in handy.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:40]:\
This is because the Social Bee app.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:42]:\
Can offer evergreen categories, which helps with recycling and reusing your articles again and again. And we also offer variation features, which.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:53]:\
Means that you can set different variations to your post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:59]:\
So basically what we did here in.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:01]:\
The editorial calendar, these are variations of.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:05]:\
The same blog post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:06]:\
We created separate posts for a longer.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:10]:\
Period of time to promote the same blog post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:14]:\
Those are variations that Social Bee can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:16]:\
Handle as well as planning or customizing.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:19]:\
Your posts for each platform.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:21]:\
But don't take my word for it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:23]:\
Let's go into Social Bee and show you exactly how we can help with all of this.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:29]:\
What you're seeing right now are categories from Social Bee. We have two types of categories, just like the two types of content that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:38]:\
You can have on your website. Evergreen content, which is the one that gets recycled and share once content, which is the one that can be time sensitive, or content that you only want to share once.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:51]:\
Now, going into the category, you'll see.\
\
Anca Pop [00:20:55]:\
The posts that are included in that category and how they have variations. As you can see here, we have each one of the posts from the editorial calendar added as a variation to this post. We have created two specific posts, but.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:15]:\
That's just because we want to spread this out over a longer period of time. You also have previews on how the.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:22]:\
Post will look like on each selected social media platform. And also it's very easy to see.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:28]:\
That when you add a post as well.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:30]:\
So let's just do that for the sake of showing you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:35]:\
I'll just click add a post here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:37]:\
I'll select Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and then I'll just paste the first post from our editorial calendar. As you can see, it immediately generated a link preview, which is a visual that I was talking about earlier. And we also have everything ready here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:55]:\
On the right side we have a.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:57]:\
Live preview on what your post will look like once published on each individual social platform. So we have it here for Facebook.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:06]:\
Then this is what it will look.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:07]:\
Like once published on Twitter and finally on LinkedIn as well.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:13]:\
Now, you can also customize this for each profile and that's actually something that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:18]:\
We advise that you do simply because each platform has a separate tone of voice.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:25]:\
Each platform has separate specifications when it.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:28]:\
Comes to visuals like images, best practices and such. And also because each platform has a.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:35]:\
Specific character limit that may not work for other platforms. For instance, on Facebook you can talk.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:43]:\
Quite a lot about your posts and.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:46]:\
Go more in depth. But on Twitter you need to limit yourself to 280 characters.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:53]:\
So that means you need to keep.\
\
Anca Pop [00:22:54]:\
It short and sweet so you can do that within the same post while keeping the main essence of the post.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:02]:\
The same for all of your platforms.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:06]:\
You can also change the image for.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:08]:\
Each one of them. So let's say we want to replace.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:12]:\
The link with an actual image.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:15]:\
We can also do that from here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:17]:\
Now, once you've customized it for each.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:20]:\
Profile, you can also add variations, which.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:23]:\
Are the ones that I showed you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:25]:\
A little earlier by clicking the Add variation button.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:29]:\
Now I'm not going to do that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:23:30]:\
Because I already have prepared them here. So you can see all of the variations added here, as well as a yellow ring around the social media profile that you're seeing the version of. So if you were to change to customize the content for Twitter to be shorter, for instance, when you clicked on Twitter, it would show a shorter text. When you clicked on Facebook, it would show the version that you created for your Facebook and so on.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:02]:\
Now, once you have all of this content created into your categories, the next.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:09]:\
Step would be to schedule them.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:11]:\
And you can do that directly from Social Bee. And I'm actually going to show you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:16]:\
A little on how our scheduling works. You're here in the schedule overview of Social Bee. This is where you can either generate a preset schedule that's based on Best Practices, it's something that we provide to help you get started, or you can create your own schedule starting from scratch. It's up to you fully.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:37]:\
And you can include your categories here.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:40]:\
So that you know exactly when each.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:43]:\
Type of content is going out.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:45]:\
For instance, we have our Friends category.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:48]:\
Going out every Friday. This means that one of those posts.\
\
Anca Pop [00:24:54]:\
That we have in the Evergreen category will go out every Friday and it goes out in a top to bottom order, which means that we will take the first post from the top first. The second Friday we will have the second post go out, and so on.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:11]:\
Until we reach the end of the list. And once that happens, if you don't.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:15]:\
Add any other posts in that category, it will start again. Back from the top. Now, what this means, especially if you have a lot of content, is that you can even create content for a.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:29]:\
Full year, which means that you really have saved a lot of time.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:35]:\
Now, this is what Social Bee looks like, and I really hope that this.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:40]:\
Catches your eye and you're curious more about it, because if you are, we have a special offer for you very soon. But first, let's look at what we've.\
\
Anca Pop [00:25:53]:\

\
Anca Pop [00:26:14]:\
Finding out some hooks that you can.\
\
Anca Pop [00:26:17]:\
Then transform into your social media posts. We talked about staying organized with an.\
\
Anca Pop [00:26:24]:\

\
Anca Pop [00:27:15]:\
Now, before I go, I wanted to launch a challenge, and that's the slide that I skipped there for a second. I want you to repurpose your content for ten days. That's all I want.\

\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:31]:\
All right, Anca, thank you so much for sharing all that information. I know I learned a lot. I really loved the Joey example with a friend, which is just fantastic. And so I know you mentioned it in your presentation, but you guys do have a really great offer for attendees, which I appreciate you guys putting together. So thank you for that. But can we dive a little bit deeper into what it would look like? I think if they go to the link, I think they sign up for a trial before they even have to pay with the discount.\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:00]:\
Is that right?\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:01]:\
They definitely can if they want to, but they also can go ahead and purchase the platform right ahead if they.\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:08]:\
Also want to do that.\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:09]:\
The trial is 14 days, so they can try it for free before deciding if they want to purchase Socialbee or not. And we have multiple plans available, so depending on the budget or the size of your business, you can go for one or another plan.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:26]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:27]:\
And then so the concierge onboarding you're offering, that's huge. What is that? What are you taking off their initial.\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:36]:\
Set up, first of all.\
\
Anca Pop [00:29:37]:\
And if they have content on other social media management tools, we can also migrate that content over so that they don't lose anything. Everything's right where it's supposed to be and ready to be published.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:51]:\
Yeah. Because bloggers are always struggling to find time. We have lots of sessions on that. So I think that's a huge value I had to get set up when I started with Social Bee. If you want to make sure it gets set up right and also just your stuff gets moved over without you having to sweat it, that's fantastic.\
\
Anca Pop [00:30:13]:\
Give you a few guidelines on how you can navigate the social media world within that onboarding. So we create the initial batch of content for you to base your strategy on further on.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:27]:\

[00:00:13.140] - Anca\
Hi everyone, and thank you for joining me. Today we're going to talk about how you can get maximum results from social media as a blogger. But before we dive in, let me first introduce myself. Hi. My name is Anca.\
\
[00:00:25.930] - Anca\
I'm a customer success specialist at Socialbee.io. If you don't know what SocialBee is, don't worry. We're a social media management tool that empowers businesses and entrepreneurs to be consistent in their social media presence. And we also help you save more time and be better at your social media journey with less effort. While at SocialBee, I've been guiding our users to start doing more on their social media and being more consistent in their scheduling.\
\
[00:01:00.060] - Anca\
And hopefully, I can do the same for you guys today. So, let's go into a little bit of what are we going to talk about today? By the end of this conference, you'll know a little bit on how you can choose the social media platforms that work for you, the role of social media plays in your strategy, how you can build your strategy, and so much more. If you're ready to dive in, let's go. First things first, let's talk about how you can choose the perfect platforms for your business and how you choose your audience as well.\
\
[00:01:37.390] - Anca\
The thing that needs to happen first is to select your audience or to make sure you define your audience, so to speak. So, depending on what platforms you want to use or what audience you have, you're going to have to use specific channels to reach that audience. And typically, based on age groups, you can kind of understand where your audience is at. So, think first, who am I talking about? Who needs to hear what I have to say?\
\
[00:02:08.650] - Anca\
And then we're going to go into where are they spending their time? If they're Gen Z, they might be spending their time on Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube, snapchat, whatever.\
\
[00:02:20.440] - Anca\
Older generations, millennials and older might be going to Facebook. There might be going to Twitter, YouTube as well, depending on what type of content you're sharing. But if you're also working more in a B to B niche, you're going to focus on LinkedIn as well. So, consider all of these aspects and see what platforms are best suited for your existing audience. When you're looking at the social media channels that you're going to use and how they work for the people that you want to reach, you're going to have to see what people look for in specific social media platforms.\
\
[00:03:00.460] - Anca\
For example, Instagram, people look to be educated. They look to be inspired or motivated or entertained in any way, so that they can spend their time in a good vibe, so to speak. On the other hand, if you look at Twitter, text dominates, whereas Instagram has more video and images you can look at. Depending on the type of content that you're sharing, where your audience might be going for that specific type of content. If you're looking at LinkedIn, on the other hand, you might have content going out for professionals, right?\
\
[00:03:43.260] - Anca\
So, you see case studies, you see infographics, you might see white papers, you might see thought leaders sharing their opinions with the professionals in that industry. So, focus on what each social media platform has to offer and think about the types of content that you can include in your strategy, so that you can reach your target audience on these social media channels. Once you have that down, the second step is to move your prospect into the next stage of the sales funnel. Why would you need a sales funnel? And what is that exactly?\
\
[00:04:22.920] - Anca\
First of all, let's define the sales funnel for a second. You can imagine it as an actual funnel where people go through different stages in their journey to get to where you want them to go. So, they start with the awareness where they become aware of your presence and they become aware of what you have to offer. They go through the interest phase, the desire, and then in the end, they take the actions that you want them to. Whether that's a sale, whether that's a newsletter subscription, whether that's whatever it is that you're offering.\
\
[00:04:59.590] - Anca\
Why are these important? Well, they can help you find prospects. They can help maximize the impact of your content and your message by matching your call to actions and your audience's level of interest. If someone's just learning about you, they will not sign up for the newsletter right away. They need to see that they're going to get value and that your content resonates with their values before they sign up for the newsletter, or even more before they purchase something.\
\
[00:05:33.260] - Anca\
So, you can focus your efforts into one of the stages or each of the stages, so that you can make sure that your audiences get the right message for the stage they're in. So, what's the role of social media in all of this, you ask? Well, you can think of it this way. It answers three major questions, the ones that you're seeing on your screen right now, and I think I'm going to make this smaller, so that you can actually see what's behind my image there. So, the questions are how do they find your social media accounts?\
\
[00:06:12.960] - Anca\
Well, they could do this by looking at hashtags. They could do this from listening to your podcast. They could do this from someone recommending your blog or your content or your social media. They can do this by finding your content in specific niche groups. On Facebook, for instance, there are several ways in which they can find out about you.\
\
[00:06:35.740] - Anca\
Then you can look at how you want them to think or feel about your business. Do you want them to view you as trendy? Do you want them to view you as lighthearted? Do you want them to see you as a professional. Placing yourself in the right aspect or the right state of mind for them is very important.\
\
[00:06:58.310] - Anca\
And then what action do you want them to take? Do you want them to sign up to your email list, buy an ebook, join a webinar, read the blog post, whatever it is, think about the actions that you want them to take and encourage those actions on your social media posts.\
\
[00:07:21.640] - Anca\
Sorry. So, let's talk about how we can approach social media strategically. And that's going to take about five steps, starting with number one, identifying your objectives. Here you can get as broad as you'd like. I want, as a blogger, I want 10,000 new blog visits in a year.\
\
[00:07:47.620] - Anca\
Right? I'm just throwing up a random number there. Okay, so I want to increase my blog traffic. I have my objective. Now let's go over to the second point, which is where I will pinpoint my goal.\
\
[00:08:03.840] - Anca\
And how do I do that? I get more specific with it. How do I measure increasing my blog traffic while looking at the analytics, looking at my social media, looking at everything, and seeing how I get from 1000 unique visitors per day to 10,000 unique visitors per day, let's say. The third step is to determine the key points or the KPIs that will help you in reaching that goal. So, now is where we get really specific and we say, okay, so if we're at 1000 and we want to get to 10,000, we're going to need 9000 unique visitors per day as an increase.\
\
[00:08:50.430] - Anca\
And how long would it take us to get there? Probably a year. Okay, so that way I know I need to gain 9000 unique visitors per day in a year's time and I can create work and I can create steps that can help me achieve that goal. Fourth and fifth steps are kind of interconnected because first you're going to look and lay out your content ideas and then you're going to plan that content ahead. So, let's see about laying out the content ideas.\
\
[00:09:30.520] - Anca\
First things first, let me introduce you to the concept of a content mix, which is where different types of content work for different areas of your business. So, you have educational content, you have motivational content, interactive content for engagement purposes, promotional content if you're selling things, curated content, so that you bring some authority from outside sources as well. Evergreen content, it's content that you can recycle and reuse every now and again.\
\
[00:10:02.320] - Anca\
And of course, because this is social media, you're also going to throw in some entertaining content, right? The purpose of having different types of content instead of just one is to avoid audience fatigue. Audience fatigue is when people see the same thing over and over again, they get bored. So, if they only see you promoting something, I don't know, let's say subscribe to my newsletter, subscribe to my newsletter, subscribe to my newsletter. On the fourth time, I'm going to ignore that noise or even unsubscribe.\
\
[00:10:37.060] - Anca\
Because I don't want to keep seeing the same thing over and over again on my feed. I've already seen that I need something new, I need something challenging, I need something entertaining, and so on. And so what you can do is mix and match with different types of content that you're using, so that you can create a balance with the types of content that you're using. And that way, prevent your audience from getting to that point, prevent them from reaching audience fatigue. And then once you have those categories laid out, the next step, and the final step also, is to plan your content.\
\
[00:11:17.380] - Anca\
This is where you will look at when your audience is online. Think about it this way, someone who's commuting to work back and forth and maybe has a nine to five job will be online typically during commute times because you know it's dead time. They might be online in the mornings, they might be online in the afternoons, but they will not most likely be online while they're at work. On the other hand, if you have a blog that's focused for stay-at-home mothers, you might have different patterns with the moms or the parents that stay at home and take care of their children because those audiences, they have a different routine. So, they might be online when the kid is at sleep or when they're at school, depending on how old they are, and so on.\
\
[00:12:12.710] - Anca\
So, really look at how and when your audience is online. On the second step is to look at the best time to publish for each platform and customizing your schedule based on that as well. So, you have some general best practices. You know, promotional content typically works best at around lunchtime, educational content in the morning, entertaining content in the evenings, and so on. But these are pretty general, so you can take the general things and combine them with the knowledge that you have about your specific audience and then reach the best times to post for that specific audience.\
\
[00:12:57.330] - Anca\
And of course, the third step here is to always test, adjust and repeat the process over and over again. Because consumer behaviors change, patterns change, people change, and so does your content. So, you have to constantly evolve with whatever else is going on, right? Good. So, when you're publishing content, it's always good to stay consistent. And how do you do that?\
\
[00:13:26.440] - Anca\
You plan ahead of course. But why is it important to stay consistent? Well, first of all, you avoid spamming. This is something that I see a lot and I'm sure you do too on Facebook and other platforms as well, where maybe it's a one person show and they don't really have the time to spend posting frequently on social media. So, whenever they do, they just dump 30 photos and 30 posts in there and you see them all and then they disappear for two months.\
\
[00:13:59.220] - Anca\
And that classifies as spamming content. Spamming your audience while still being active, because they will see a lot of content all of a sudden from you and then forget about you because you're not consistently there, top of mind. You can avoid this, of course, by staying consistent in your schedule, by creating a specific and consistent posting schedule, even if that only means posting once per week, but sticking to it. So, you can do this again by planning and scheduling your posts ahead.\
\
[00:14:37.160] - Anca\
One tip that I have for you is to use either the 80-20 rule or the 4-1-1 rule that I have laid out here. The 4-1-1 rule typically says that for every six posts you have, one should be a soft cell, one should be a hard sell, and the rest of four posts should either entertain, educate, or both. And you can take into account this specific rule regardless of how frequent you're posting. So, if you're posting once a day, that's six days worth of content. If you're posting once a week, that's six weeks worth of content.\
\
[00:15:16.350] - Anca\
If you're posting once per month, that's six months worth of content. So, you can really adjust it depending on how frequently you're posting. Now, let's look at how we can dive into these posts a little more in detail. First of all, the educational and entertaining posts, they can be a mix of different things. They can be a mix of your educating blog posts, YouTube, podcast.\
\
[00:15:46.480] - Anca\
They can be content that's curated from outside sources. They can be whatever it is that you need it to be. On the other hand, the soft sale might be a testimonial, it might be a review, it might be something like that. And the hard sell is promoting your actual business, so that it does stay top of mind to your audience.\
\
[00:16:10.010] - Anca\
Okay, we've gotten through quite a lot, but we still have some way to go. First of all, let's talk about how we can get the most out of the content that we've created. You typically work with a lot of blog content if you're a blogger, right? So, what you can do with that is to repurpose content that's not time sensitive, so that you can use it time and time again. This will maximize your traffic for that blog post.\
\
[00:16:37.900] - Anca\
It will help you save time because now you don't have to constantly think of new post ideas, but rather recycle the ones that you already have. And it will help bring your audiences more and more into your website.\
\
[00:16:55.010] - Anca\
You can repurpose your blog content in so many ways. So, let's start with one blog post as you can see here on the left. You'll see that one blog post is a source for some insights that can be turned into discussion points. And there can be several social media posts, by the way. It can be turned into quotes that again, you can spread in a lot of social media posts and use them as bite-sized, industry knowledge, or they can get used as thought leadership pieces, general info, personal opinions on a topic. So, depending on the blog post and what they're about, you can go for a lot of information there.\
\
[00:17:40.810] - Anca\
If it's a podcast, you can also turn that into a blog post first and then spread it out into multiple pieces or snippets of information. And with a podcast generally, if it also has a video as well. But even if it doesn't, you can get a lot more engagement by using it in reels and YouTube shorts and TikToks and encouraging people to listen to you, to look at you, to do all of that and make it more engaging that way. And then when you're posting on social media, you also have to follow the requirements for each platform, as I'm sure you know. Let's talk about the common structure of a post on any platform.\
\
[00:18:23.710] - Anca\
It typically includes a word count, sorry. An image size or a post format, which might be a feed post, story post, a reel, a tiktok, depending on the platform that you're on, and also the type of post that you're looking at, which, you know, some platforms, like TikTok, require videos, others might need carousels to work best, like Instagram, like LinkedIn, Facebook. They can go with linked previews and things like that.\
\
[00:18:55.710] - Anca\
Some of them work best with a lot of hashtags, others don't work with hashtags at all. So, take all of these elements into consideration when creating the structure of your posts. Now, if we're to compare a little bit, I just have two comparisons here. First one is Facebook versus Twitter, where the word count is extremely different. Facebook has a lot of characters.\
\
[00:19:19.450] - Anca\
You can really write novels. In the Facebook posts, you have 63,000 characters, whereas on Twitter, you only have 280 characters. So, you have to be really precise with your message. Even so, if you look at the ideal word count, you can see that Facebook ideally has 50 characters or less, which is content that you see above the fold, or content that is before the see more label comes in. On the other hand, because Twitter is so short, you can really maximize the use of your characters.\
\
[00:19:59.810] - Anca\
If we're looking at hashtags, you can see that Facebook doesn't really do hashtags. You can use them, but they don't make such a difference, at least not right now. Whereas on Twitter, around two hashtags per post really, really work. You can also look at the differences between the best times to post and the frequency as well, which is very different. On Facebook, it's ideal that you post at least once a day.\
\
[00:20:26.220] - Anca\
On Twitter, it's ideal that you post at least 15 times a day, and that's because tweets being so short and so many, you really have to retweet it and be there in the moment in order to see it properly. On a different note, we can see two seemingly very different platforms, LinkedIn and Instagram, which work in very similar ways. Right now, you can look at character limits which are pretty similar as well as the ideal character limits as well. You can see that both platforms use hashtags, even though the number of hashtags are different. And you can also see similarities in the posting frequencies as well as the best posting times.\
\
[00:21:13.090] - Anca\
So, don't think that just because the platforms are different or similar that they have the same best practices. As you can see in these two examples, LinkedIn and Instagram could not be further away from each other and yet the best practices are so close together, whereas Twitter and Facebook, they are the same idea, but they're very different in structure and how you can use your posts to maximize the views. Let's summarize a little bit on all of the things that we went through in today's session and see where we're at right now. So, my advice would be to concentrate on the platforms that are relevant to your audience and to your business. Use the social media channels that are available to you to move your prospects through your sales funnel that you first build.\
\
[00:22:09.860] - Anca\
Have a strategic approach to your social media posting, repurpose content that you have that is not time-sensitive, and create content that respects the requirements and best practices. Now, we've created all of this content. We've established a consistency, frequency to our content, and then we just drop it because sometimes it happens that we don't have the time to publish the content properly. So, what are we going to do in those situations? Well, here's a bonus tip.\
\
[00:22:42.040] - Anca\
You can use a social media management tool just like Social Bees, where you can actively include your content and share it across all of your platforms and make sure that your content is scheduled, that it's up to date, that it's ready to be seen by your audiences. If you're looking at my screen right now, you'll see our scheduling, our scheduling tool, I guess. This is where you schedule your content. And a little thing that sets socially apart is the fact that we do have a category-based system. So, if you're going back to the categories of content and the content type that I talked about a few slides ago, you can think of how you can create the different pillars of content in your strategy and include them in your SocialBee account.\
\
[00:23:40.860] - Anca\
And that way you don't have to constantly keep a calendar in front of your eyes just to see what the date for the third Monday of February is, so that you can schedule your content. You can just schedule your Motivation Monday category on Mondays, your Throwback Thursday on Thursdays, and then content in those categories will just get queued up and published at the right time whenever it is that they need to be published.\
\
[00:24:10.990] - Anca\
When we're talking about how you can create content in SocialBee, you can take advantage of so many tools, like the ability to customize your content for each profile, adding variations to your evergreen content, or content that's not time sensitive, and even to content that is time sensitive. For instance, I can create a countdown to a webinar or to an event by using the variations feature. I can also post my content at specific times or by just including it into the category of choice.\
\
[00:24:41.190] - Anca\
And I also have the ability to expire my content, so if it is time sensitive, I can make sure I don't have a Happy New Year post mid July. This is how the posts look in your categories in SocialBee, and they will go out as you schedule them, only if the content is set to approve. As you can see here, I have two posts in my screenshot, one that is approved, meaning it's ready to go out, and one that is set to draft mode, meaning I still have some work to do with that one before I send it out to my audience. If you stuck with me for this long and you are curious about SocialBee, we do have a special offer for you. So, thank you for sticking around so long.\
\
[00:25:28.460] - Anca\
If you want to take advantage of SocialBee, you can get 50% off for three months on any of the monthly plans by using the discount code on the screen that's bloggers50x3. So, you can always get started by accessing app.socialbee.io. And if you have any questions on SocialBee or any curiosities, you can always reach out to either me or my colleagues on hello@socialbee.io or find out more about us on our website at SocialBee.io. Thank you all for joining me today and I do really hope I was able to shed some light on how you can maximize your social media strategy for your blog and get more out of your social media channels.\

**Transcript:**\
Anca Pop [00:00:12]:\
Hi everyone. Welcome to today's session. My name is Anca and I'm a social media strategist here at SocialBee. Over the past 10 years, I've had the pleasure of working with businesses to help them maximize their online presence and stay ahead of social media trends. Today, I'm excited to have to be here and discuss with you some of the potential 2025 social media trends that you won't be able to ignore. So let's dive right in. These are a few of the trends that we're going to go over in today's talk, but before we do that, let me know which trends do you think will move on into 2025. So I'm gonna go ahead and start with the first trend that we have on our roster today, and that is the rise of niche social media networks.\
\
Anca Pop [00:01:10]:\
We're actually seeing a significant shift towards niche networks, and you can think of these as communities built around specific interests or specific demographics. For instance, you can look at Cara. That is a social media platform that caters to artists. This shift is driven by the growing desire for more more of a personalized experience, and it looks for data transparency as well. So unlike mainstream platforms which are more general looking, these niche networks will offer tighter knit communities and more relevant content for that targeted audience. So this trend presents a unique opportunity for brands and if you're targeting a specific, a specific industry, a specific audience, things like that, it's worth exploring, these smaller, more targeted platforms, where users might be more highly engaged. You can look at platforms, as I mentioned, like Cara who's, a catering to artists. You can look at platforms like, Caffeine, which is a similar one, but for gaming and gamers or even Goodreads, which is a platform that is dedicated to readers, to book readers.\
\
Anca Pop [00:02:35]:\
And you can connect with authors and leave reviews on the books and things like that. So these are very, niched, very industry forward platforms that will be, generating more interest and more authenticity from your followers as well. The second trend that we're looking at is social media acting as a search engine. Over the past few years, we've already seen this happen with platforms like Instagram, like TikTok, like Pinterest, platforms that have been evolving into search engines. You heard that right. As a matter of fact, over 40% of Gen Zers are reportedly using TikTok instead of Google when it comes to their searches. So they are TikToking more than they are Googling. This will be the new verb, I tell you.\
\
Anca Pop [00:03:31]:\
A significant number of these users now rely on platforms that are social to find relevant products that they might need to solve issues, to explore trends, or to discover new ideas. So to capitalize on this shift, you as a brand must strategically think about the search visibility of your content. So, essentially, what I'm trying to say is that incorporating natural keywords into your social media posts, into your captions, hashtags, alt text, and everything included, will help you make your content more findable or more searchable or more SEO friendly, if you will. Additionally, it will help you leverage, features like the alt text that I just mentioned or TikTok's SEO options and help you with optimizing your content in that direction. So in here, I guess there's there's a shift that's happening from traditional SEO into, into the social media world and how content now is becoming very SEO friendly in a more natural way than traditional SEO would, would make it. The 3rd big trend that we have over here is the decline of intrusive advertising. So in the recent years, we've seen users become increasingly wary of ads that are intrusive or disruptive in nature. We've noticed that people tend to prefer ads that are relevant, ads that are contextual, that are personalized to their experience, and to the platform that they are currently using.\
\
Anca Pop [00:05:25]:\
This is why you'll find that TikTok, will have more natively integrated ads than other platforms that you might be seeing. With TikTok, it's a whole experience that can be very easily disruptive and distraught if you are just scrolling and you just find a different ad that takes you out of that scrolling phase. So, users tend to prefer ads that are seamlessly integrated in their in their social media experience, in their feed. As a matter of fact, there's a recent survey that showed that around, 70% ish of users skip the ads if they find them disruptive or if they find them irrelevant. So it's very important to target the right audience and to make sure that you're integrating the ad as natively as possible. What does this mean for a brand? Well, you'll need to get creative, first of all. You'll need to make sure that you collaborate with influencers, with content creators, that you're leveraging native ad trends and that you're blending this within your content strategy. So instead of using traditional ads, you might want to consider sponsored posts or, telling stories or, video ads that just provide the value upfront.\
\
Anca Pop [00:06:56]:\
So these are the types of of ads that we're seeing might work better moving forward as opposed to more intrusive advertising tactics. We're moving on to the 4th, trend and that is the best social media strategies are just that, they are social. This is one of the most fundamental principles of social media and it's something that's not necessarily a trend more so than a reminder. So, if you're only broadcasting messages without engaging with your audience, without making sure that you, create a community and and an an an a a level of interaction with your socials and your audience, you might be missing the point. It's crucial, as a brand on social media, to actively comment on posts, to reply to any mentions, to any comments, to any DMs, to participate in conversations that are relevant to your brand. So one tip that I have in this sense is to create a community building strategy. This will have, will involve, you interacting with your audience on a more deeper level so that you create that sense of community. So my advice to you would be to maybe start discussions, to conduct polls, to encourage user generated content, to encourage your audience to talk to you as much as possible.\
\
Anca Pop [00:08:33]:\
So what you'll see is that, the more you do it, the more of a success you you get. And there's different ways to do this as well. So you can go the helpful approach or you can do a more funny, and humorous approach like Wendy's does for for instance, which is an excellent way to engage with your community by responding with humor instead of of helpfulness, so to speak, and making making sure that followers are part of a community in this sense. The 5th trend is talking a little more about a shift from viral content into more of a quality content. So the days of prioritizing viral content for the sake of just fame that's fleeting away are gone. They're gone. Instead, we're seeing a shift towards more meaningful engagement as I was saying in the previous one and more audience connection, more of this instead of just virality. Not to say that virality is not important, but it's not important in every single post that you have.\
\
Anca Pop [00:09:57]:\
So it's no longer about creating the next viral meme or, about being overnight famous and getting a lot of followers and things like that. But rather, it's about reaching the right people with the content that they resonate with deeply. So you can look at this and figure out how you can avoid getting caught in maybe chasing viral success and just create the content that you feel is authentic to you and that you feel will be relevant and authentic to your particular audience. That's all that matters. The 6th trend that we're talking about is social media for customer service. So in this case, we're talking about how social media is not just for marketing these days, but actually, it's a powerful tool that you can use for customer service, for customer success, and so on. Actually, by engaging with your customers in real time and making sure that you address their concerns, publicly, you can make sure that you're giving transparency, that you're giving commitment to your audience. Brands like JetBlue, for instance, have turned social media into a customer service channel by making sure that they respond quickly and proactively to any particular problem that their audience might be having.\
\
Anca Pop [00:11:33]:\
So in this case, it's important to monitor brand mentions to make sure that you always do, kind of a sentiment analysis on your social media and make sure that you stay ahead of potential problems. It's also important to resolve any issues that come up in a prompt manner as well as professional manner so that, the overall sentiment is a happy one, a positive note for your brand. And this will help with make sure with making sure that your content and your your presence online, stays top of mind to your audience whenever they need you. It's as simple as that. I'm gonna drink some water and then we continue with the 7th, trend. Okay. So trend number 7. This is the rise of de influencing.\
\
Anca Pop [00:12:38]:\
Influencing. If you're familiar with influencing, and influencers in general, it's, a a type of content creator that will, cause users to maybe purchase more of specific products, in, in favor of of specific brands. So with de influencing, This trend is the exact opposite of that. So it's it's actually a fascinating trend where you see influencers and users of all kind, content creators, actively discourage people from purchasing overhyped or ineffective products. This is a trend that kind of is needed, because there has always been and and I think in most recent years more so than in the past, there's been a desire for authenticity and accountability that brands seem to have a lower concern for in the previous years. So to align with this shift, you must focus on transparency, on honest marketing, making sure that you say when things are great and when things are not as great. It's also important to say and be honest about things that maybe are not as great as anyone would think. So you can look about de influencing, products that might no longer be helpful to you or your community and replacing them with something else that, will build your consumer trust.\
\
Anca Pop [00:14:29]:\
So so, yeah, build genuine relationships with brands, with bloggers, with communities, and make sure that you work towards building that trust that will allow you to influence and deinfluence at the same time. That's, my prediction for this particular, trend. Now we're moving into the 8th and final trend, which is integrating multiple marketing channels. So in 2025, we're seeing more brands move towards more integrated marketing campaigns. Social media is no longer a standalone channel, but a vital piece in a broader spectrum puzzle. You can look at brands to ensure consistency across all of these touchpoints, whether it's email marketing, websites, in store experiences, online with social media, and so much more. These are more integrated and unified in what brands have as a marketing strategy and not different strategies for different purposes. So, in this case, you can think of it, the social media channels.\
\
Anca Pop [00:15:41]:\
You can think of them as kind of like the glue that, binds all of these efforts together And you can think of examples, like the one on the screen. Instead of simply directing users to an article, engage with them through interactive content and conversations that lead to deeper engagement. This is one simple way to take a blog article, which is a separate type of marketing, introduce it into your social media scene, and work with it together to create conversation within your social media channels while also driving traffic to your blog so that people can read, that article in more depth. So that's just one option. These are all of the trends that I have for 2025. I'm curious to see how many of these, you had on your list. So let me know, if you had them or not. I do have some additional help and additional tips and tricks that I wanna share with you next.\
\
Anca Pop [00:16:53]:\
So just kind of to wrap it up, I wanna leave you with this particular thought. Social media management is a battle, that's fought on multiple fields. It is constantly evolving and it it's and it's very important for you to stay ahead of trends in order to remain relevant. By making sure that you embrace these trends, so niche networks, search engine optimization, centric approach, by making sure your ads are contextual, by making sure that you're prioritizing genuine connections, by making sure that you're aligning yourself with the right people online, I think that you'll be ready to thrive in 2025 when it comes to social media marketing. And the best part is that you can do all of this a lot easier by having a tool, in your toolkit. A tool like SocialBee, for instance, which can take you through the entire flow starting with connecting your profiles. In SocialBee, you can connect all of the profiles that you, need starting from the entire meta suite. So Facebook, Instagram, threads, going further into X, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and all of these other good platforms that will allow you to stay relevant on social media.\
\
Anca Pop [00:18:20]:\
These are the general ones, but if you're interested in using the niche platforms, you can also connect those to SocialBee with something called universal posting, which is a little more of a semi automated way of posting. So it actually gives you a mobile notification when it's time to post on platforms that don't currently have any scheduling options that are direct. Once you have your profiles connected in SocialBee, you can move on to the second step, which is creating content categories or content pillars or types of content or buckets of content or however you wanna call them. Essentially, this is a way for you to organize your content so that you are always aware of the types of content that you need to create content for in order to stay on top of your social media strategy. So if you have content that's promotional, content that's educational, content that's entertaining, content that's curated from other sources. Now you have a place to organize these into pillars and make it a lot easier for you to balance out that content mix. Speaking about balancing out a content mix, the third thing that you can do in SocialBee is create that content schedule based on your categories. So instead of having to go in and add a specific posting date to every blog post that you wanna schedule on Wednesday, you can just go ahead and schedule the blog post category for Wednesdays at 9.\
\
Anca Pop [00:19:51]:\
And that will help you make sure that you're being consistent, that you're not missing a date, that you are saving time and not doing the tedious and repetitive task of having to schedule each individual post because it is a lot easier to just schedule the category and queue up that post in the category itself. But adding the post is not enough, so the next thing that you need to do is publish the post. Right? Once they're published, you'll be able to do 2 different things. 1, reply to comments, to mentions, to DMs, which is something that you should do on a daily basis. And you can do that even, in SocialBee, by using the engage feature, which will allow you to monitor and reply to these comments, mentions, DMs directly in the platform across all of your channels, making it easier for you to to interact with your audience. But, also, you'll be able to track your analytics and export the necessary data in order to make sure that you're working your best content out there, that you are changing and evolving your content according to what your audience needs. You can try SocialBee for a 14 day free trial and once you're happy with it, because I'm sure you will be, you can get 50% off the 1st 3 months of your subscription by using the code blogger50x3 at checkout. So thanks for for joining us today.\
\
Anca Pop [00:21:19]:\
I'm happy I could be here with you. If there are any questions at a later time, you can always reach out to us, myself personally at Anca@socialbee.com or the team at hello@socialbee.com. That's it from me. Have a great rest of your day and I'll see you guys next time.\

[00:00:14.390] - Speaker 1\
Hey there. My name is Angie Gensler, and I am so excited you are here for this free training. So today we're going to talk about how to stop hustling on social media and you're going to learn my secrets to stress-free social media marketing. So within the training today, you are going to learn my nine myths about social media marketing, and I'll reveal the nine truths for you. And then we're going to talk about engagement, specifically how to increase engagement. And that's because engagement is the key on social media. So I'm going to share five tips with you today on how to increase engagement. And then finally, you're going to learn a really incredible content creation hack that's going to help you create engaging content in record time.\
\
[00:01:04.550] \
Now I'm going to go fairly fast through this training and I'm going to share a lot of actionable tips. So, you may want to get a pen and paper out to take notes and make sure that you eliminate all distractions. So, shut everything down on your computer, close your door, silence your phone. Let everyone in your home know that you are taking some time out to learn some new strategies to grow your business and to not distract you.\
\
[00:01:30.620] \
Now, I also want to make sure that you're in the right place and you're not about to waste 30 minutes of your precious precious time. So let's talk about who this training is for. I have designed this specifically for busy online entrepreneurs and bloggers, team of one marketers, and traditional small business owners. So essentially, the training is geared toward people who fulfill almost every role within their businesses, so they wear all the hats. If that's you, this is the perfect training for you.\
\
[00:02:05.110] \
Now, this training is not designed to be for aspiring influencers. If your goal with social media marketing is to become Insta famous and sell your image and your opinions, instead of selling a product or service, this is not the right training for you. Now, this training is also not geared towards B2B marketers or companies with a really large social media team or a large budget. Again, this training is designed specifically for anyone trying to market their business with a small or no team and little to no budget. Okay, so if that fits you, let's keep going. Let's dive right in.\
\
[00:02:41.490] - Speaker 1\
First, I want to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Angie Gensler, and I am the creator of angiegensler.com, where I teach social media and digital marketing strategies. Now, I am very passionate about teaching small business owners how to grow without the hustle or the headache. So that's kind of my thing. But it's not just me in this business. This is my husband, Trevor, and he is my partner, and he really takes more of a behind-the-scenes role. So he handles all the technical aspects in the day-to-day operations and management of our business.\
\
[00:03:21.870] \
Now because you are building a business and you're not just dabbling in a hobby. I think that it's really important that you rely on trusted experts to guide you along the way. So I want to share what makes me qualified to teach you this and why you can trust me as your guide. So first, I have over 15 years of experience running my own successful businesses and I have over twelve years of experience as a professional marketer. \
\
[00:03:48.090] - Speaker 1\
I also have a bachelor's degree in marketing and a master's in Business Administration and Marketing. And I have been a professional social media marketer since 2010. On top of that, my work has been featured in Social Media Examiner, Social Media Today, and many other credible sites, and my website, angiegensler.com gets over 1 million visitors a year. And since starting my business in 2016, I've built it into a seven-figure online business. On top of all that, I'm also the creator of the Social Content App and the Social Content System, which are tools used by more than 50K small business owners and marketers around the world. \
\
[00:04:32.430] - Speaker 1\
Okay, so now you know what makes me qualified to teach social media marketing? I want to share what makes me different from other social media marketing experts. Now, most experts will teach Hustle methods and they require you to be attached to social media. And these Hustle methods, yeah, they may work to grow your following. They really apply, though, more to aspiring influencers, not real-life everyday business owners, bloggers, and marketers. So instead, I teach methods that eliminate the hustle and headache. And they are actually doable for a small business owner who has no desire to spend all day on social media. You need to be running your business, not your Instagram account. \
\
[00:05:17.370] - Speaker 1\
Okay, so to get started, I want to talk about nine social media myths and these nine myths play into the Hustle culture. And to be quite honest, many of them scare small business owners completely away from social media. I have seen so many people avoid social media because they believed one of these myths.\
\
[00:05:40.470] \
Okay, so are you ready to bust some myths that could be hurting your business? Let's jump in. So myth number one is that social media is free. Well, yes, you can create a free profile and you can start promoting your business on any platform for free. You don't have to invest money.\
\
[00:05:59.380] \
The truth is, social media costs a lot of time, and when you're filling every role in your business, you're ahead of finance, HR marketing, product development, customer service, you name it. Your time is precious and time is money. On top of that, you may have to pay for additional tools in order to help you create a schedule and promote your content on social media. So social media is not "free" and what you need to know is what your time is worth so that you can spend it wisely. \
\
[00:06:33.810] - Speaker 1\
So if you spend 2 hours creating an Instagram reel, that's 2 hours that you're not making cold calls or you're not writing a new blog post to attract new customers to your site, to your business. So really think about your time as money so that you can spend it accordingly.\
\
[00:06:51.570] \
Okay, myth number two is that you have to be on every single social network. Now, this is absolutely not true. The truth is you just need to be where your ideal customer is. Your ideal customer isn't on every single channel. \
\
[00:07:08.100] - Speaker 1\
They are likely spending time more time on one channel versus the others. So, for example, a family photographer could focus on Instagram and totally ignore Twitter, LinkedIn, and possibly even Facebook, but an A-B architectural photographer would want to focus on LinkedIn, and they could possibly ignore Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.\
\
[00:07:32.650] \
So to help you determine which channel you should focus your time on, I recommend you create a buyer persona and get really crystal clear about who your ideal customer is and where they hang out. That will help you narrow down which channel to focus on. \
\
[00:07:49.130] - Speaker 1\
Okay, myth number three is that you have to post different content to every single channel. Now, this myth goes hand in hand with the previous one. Many people think that they need to be on every channel and posting unique content to every channel. But the truth is cross-posting your content is just smart marketing. Now, if you remember, your ideal customer isn't going to be on every single channel, nor will they see your content on every single channel. So cross-post your content to maximize your reach. \
\
[00:08:25.050] - Speaker 1\
Now, you may think that this is contradicting what I said in Myth two about only being where your ideal customers are. That's true. But you can still have a presence on the other channels. So what you're going to do is create content for one channel that you've decided is your focus channel. And then you can use social media scheduling tools to cross-post that content to all your other channels. So it's really about working smarter, not harder, and leveraging tools to help you do that. And I'll share some tools with you later in the presentation to help you do just that. \
\
[00:09:00.370] - Speaker 1\
Okay, myth number four is that social media networks are broadcast channels and social media is really a place to share all about you and all about your business. But the truth is that social networks are interactive channels. They're social. Your content should be less about you and more about your audience.\
\
[00:09:24.450] \
Now, to help you create content that people will engage with. Think about questions. Questions are really the best way to engage your audience, ask questions that encourage them to respond and comment and engage with your content. \
\
[00:09:43.240] - Speaker 1\
Okay, myth number five is that you have to post three to five times a day in order to get results. Now the truth is consistency is more important than frequency. Thank goodness. Right for us busy small business owners. So I want you to find a frequency that works for you and your business and stick with that. Don't commit to posting two times a day if you can't maintain it over the long run. So to help you create content consistently, I recommend you use content creation tools. So I'm going to share a content creation tool with you at the end of the presentation. That's going to help you create content much faster, much easier.\
\
[00:10:29.490] \
Okay, let's move on to Myth number six, and that is that your images and videos have to be perfect. Many people think everything has to be flawless and be professional quality. If you're really going to grow a big following and do great on social media. But the truth is, your images and videos have to be authentic, not perfect. The days of perfect social media feeds are long gone. So, unless you are trying to get work as a model, you want to keep your images and your videos real and raw because people really aren't interested in seeing the perfect, polished version of you and your business. They want authenticity.\
\
[00:11:10.300] \
Now, this doesn't mean that you produce complete crap either, so it is worth investing a little time to learn about good lighting and good audio. But luckily your phone and good daylight is really all you need to create great images. And if you want to take it to the next level, cheap ring light, and a microphone is all you need to create good quality videos.\
\
[00:11:32.520] \
Okay, myth number seven is your feed must have a cohesive aesthetic. This one drives me crazy. You see this one more on Instagram, and it is just totally bananas. So many people are teaching that your images must have a similar look and feel to them. And it is exhausting as a small business owner and almost impossible to create this perfect cohesive aesthetic.\
\
[00:11:58.050] \
The truth is. And this is my response to that is what the heck? No true business owner has time for that. If you're an influencer, a magazine, a model, maybe you have a large team. Fine, go ahead, create a cohesive aesthetic. But for the rest of us, it's completely ridiculous.\
\
[00:12:21.100] \
So please stop worrying about your aesthetic instead, I want you to worry about honoring your brand standards. So, if you create a custom graphic that you want to share on social media, create it in your brand colors and put your logo on it. So honor your brand standards in your imagery. But don't worry about all your images having a similar look and feel and all matching and being perfect and beautiful. That is so not necessary.\
\
[00:12:48.910] \
Okay, let's move on to Myth Eight. We are almost through all the myths. Myth number eight is that you have to share lots of portraits and selfies. So if you're like me, this one really makes you cringe. \
\
[00:13:00.270] - Speaker 1\
I came of age before social media. So taking a selfie feels kind of dirty. It feels like I'm getting naked in public and I'm doing something wrong. I still struggle to come to terms with taking selfies. So luckily, if you are like me, the truth is that posts without people still get results. You don't have to have your feed filled with selfies.\
\
[00:13:24.700] \
And these images that you see here, these are taken from Simple Green Smoothies, and that's a business with nearly 4000 Instagram followers and they have very few photos of the founders within their feeds. It's really mostly pictures of fresh food, nature, and products they promote. Sometimes they have an interesting graphic that they created. So you do not have to have your feed filled with selfies to get results. So instead of sharing a bunch of selfies or a bunch of images that you think are going to get results instead, I want you to share what feels authentic and comfortable to you and your brand. Photos of food quotes, landscapes, different graphics that you create, architecture, nature photos of your products. Those will all work just great. You don't have to have your feed filled with pictures of yourself.\
\
[00:14:17.630] \
Okay, let's move on to the final myth. Myth number nine is that scheduling your posts using third-party tools will hurt your reach and your post-performance. Now, thank goodness this one is a myth.\
\
[00:14:31.870] \
The truth is scheduling tools will save you time and sanity and they don't hurt your performance. Now. Brian Peters from Buffer recently did an in-depth experiment to determine whether using social media marketing tools hurt organic reach. So he compared the reach and the impressions of posts published from third-party social media tools, and he used three different tools to test this versus posts he published natively, and thank goodness his results showed no discernible difference. And in fact, on Facebook and LinkedIn, the third-party posts actually got a slightly higher reach.\
\
[00:15:12.370] \
So to save you even more time and sanity, I recommend that you use social scheduling tools a tool like Social Bee or the PromoRepublic are really fantastic, and use those to schedule your posts and streamline your content process. At the end of the webinar, I will share some links for you where you can get a special discount through Social Bee or through the Promo Republic if you want to start using one of those tools.\
\
[00:15:40.030] \
Okay, let's move on to talk about engagement and how to get more of it on social media. So first, in case you're not sure, engagement involves actions that people take on your content. So actions such as likes and comments, shares, and retweets, save, clicks, and views, and new followers. Now, why is engagement so important?\
\
[00:16:03.770] \
Earlier, I said it is the key to social media and that's because social platforms push content that gets engagement. In fact, Facebook uses meaningful engagement, that's a term they use, as an important signal that a post should be prioritized. So that means the more engagement your posts get, the better your results. So how do you get more engagement on your post? I have five tips to share with you.\
\
[00:16:33.830] \
So the first tip is to always include an image or video in every post you make, even on Twitter. And that's because research shows that posts with an image get 2.3 times more engagement than posts without an image. So including an image or a video in your post is the easiest way to double your engagement.\
\
[00:16:57.430] \
Now, second, ask questions! Remember earlier I said to ask questions. That's a great way to get people to comment on your posts. And I have run so many experiments and tests on all the different social media channels I've managed throughout the years. And of all the different types of posts I make, questions will generate, by far, the most comments.\
\
[00:17:19.870] \
In fact, I recently just shared a post on my Instagram feed and it was a simple picture of my kids holding the neighbor's dog. And I just said, "Should we get a dog?" That's it easiest post to make ever. And it got the most comments of any post I shared all month. \
\
[00:17:36.260] - Speaker 1\
So ask questions and similar to that, should we get a dog post? They don't have to be related to your business. It just has to be something that would be engaging and would inspire people to want to comment.\
\
[00:17:50.050] \
Okay, the next tip is to use hashtags in your posts. Now, if you're not familiar with hashtags, they are a pound symbol, and when you place them before a word or a string of words inside a social media post, they will allow that post to be indexed and searched. So it's a great way to increase the reach of your content. Now, as long as you're using the right hashtags, more people are going to find your content, engage with it and follow you.\
\
[00:18:19.930] \
Okay, the next tip is to share inspiring content. So with so much negativity in our world, people really want to see positive, inspiring uplifting content on social media. On top of that, there are so many businesses that only share self-promotional content. Their feeds are just me, me, me, me, me. So your followers are going to find it really refreshing to see a post that's meant to brighten their day. It's not meant to sell them something. And when you're sharing inspirational content, it could be anything from a heartwarming story that you tell in a video. Or it could be as simple as a quote. In fact, graphics with quotes on them perform really well on social media.\
\
[00:19:01.600] \
Okay, now my fifth engagement tip for you is to celebrate holidays. Now, back in my corporate marketing days, when I managed the social media channels for $150,000,000 business, I loved it when a holiday came around, and that's because holiday posts are super easy to create and they always receive more likes than any other post. \
\
[00:19:22.670] - Speaker 1\
When you're thinking about holidays, I want you to think beyond traditional holidays like Christmas and Mother's Day. Definitely recognize those, but you can also recognize special observances like Black History Month or fun days like National Dog Day, or random days like National Hot Sauce Day. So there's a lot of different holidays that you can celebrate on social media. \
\
[00:19:44.220] - Speaker 2\
So to save you, even more time, and sanity, I recommend that you use a social scheduling tool. So the Promo Republic and Social Bee are two of my favorite scheduling tools because they're both really robust and have some great features, but they're also very affordable and to make them even more affordable for you, I've included two links below this video that will give you a special discount on both of those scheduling services, so you can go check them out and see which one fits your needs best and get a great discount on them. \
\
[00:20:17.320] - Speaker 1\
Now, I shared a lot of tips with you, but there is still the issue of the time that it takes you to create content. So, I want to share a pretty incredible content creation hack with you. It's actually a mobile app that I created for small business owners. So let me switch over to the app and I want to show you how it works.\
\
[00:20:37.750] \
Okay, so I'm inside the social content app and I want to show you my favorite part of it, and that is the Copy and Post Content. \
\
[00:20:46.290] - Speaker 1\
So let's go into November and let's click on November 4. So you can see here there is a status update for the day along with three hashtags. All you need to do is copy that status update to the clipboard, and then you can choose the image size that you want to share. So there is a post size or square image and then a story size image that you can share if you want. You can even edit these images within Canva if you want to brand them for your business, maybe add your logo or switch out colors. \
\
[00:21:22.450] - Speaker 1\
Now, this is just a photograph. So I'll show you a different image later that you can edit for your brand if you'd like. But for this example, let me just go ahead and share this to social media. So, I'm going to touch on Share Image and then I'm going to share this to my Instagram feed and we'll click through and I'm just going to hold and paste that status update. Now if I want, I can edit this if I'd like or I can just go ahead and click post and that's it. It's posted to Instagram.\
\
[00:21:54.560] \
Now if I wanted, I could also share this with a social scheduler. So let's do this again. I'm going to click Share image and instead of sharing it to my Instagram, I could choose my social scheduler app. So you see, I've got Buffer on here or Later. As long as you have your social scheduling app on your phone, you can then schedule this content through that app, instead of sending it directly to social media. It's totally up to you. Within the app, there is a copy and post piece of content for every single day of the year. \
\
[00:22:30.180] - Speaker 1\
Let's go into another one, this inspiring quote. This is where you might want to edit the images. So every element within these images is completely editable. You can change the background image, the font, the sizing, the styling, everything. And all you need to do is open up the images in Canva and then you can edit them from there. And if you don't have a Canva account already, you can create a free account and everything within these images is accessible with a free account, which is fantastic. \
\
[00:23:02.780] - Speaker 1\
Now let me show you a few other features in the app. So you see here we have quotes, questions, and brain teasers. These are all libraries of content, so I have quotes from 2022 and 2021 loaded within here already for you and within each one, if you touch on it, you will have a custom image for that quote. `So if you want, you can copy the quote to your clipboard and you can either share this image and I've got a bunch of different ones for you to choose from and different sizes. \
\
[00:23:36.730] - Speaker 1\
Or if you want again, you can go into Canva and you can edit the image, customize it to fit your brand style. It is totally up to you. So this library of content exists for quotes, questions, brain teasers so, as you can see within the Social Content app, there are so many different features, so much content to really make your life so much easier.\
\
[00:24:03.320] \
So I want to thank you guys so much for spending your time with me on this training. I really hope that you learn something valuable today and that will help you grow your business. \
\
[00:24:13.940] - Speaker 1\
And obviously, I'd love to have you give the social content app a try. So if you want to check it out, just head over to angiegensler.com social content. And if you have any questions for me or want to connect with me, reach out to me by heading over to my website at angiegensler.com.

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.540] - Liz\
Alright, guys. I'm really excited for this next session because we're going to be talking about marketing as a whole, which is something that I struggle with myself. So, our speaker is the founder of Dash of Social, it's a content marketing firm specializing in social media marketing strategy, blogging and email marketing. Working closely with their clients, our wonderful speaker Ashley and her team help small business owners and entrepreneurs craft and execute value-driven marketing strategies designed to establish thought leadership, grow online communities, and build connections and leads. So, Ashley, thank you so much for coming on here. I can't wait to ask you all the questions.\
\
[00:00:45.010] - Ashley\
Yeah, thank you for having me, Liz.\
\
[00:00:47.810] - Liz\
Yeah, so kind of the topic you propose was you know value-driven marketing, and so I think there you have to then start with values. Because I know when you start blogging, you may not realize that you have certain values associated with your blog, you haven't put them to word. How do you suggest people kind of think on that and figure out exactly what their values are to be able to then work on marketing?\
\
[00:01:14.980] - Ashley\
Yes, that's a great idea. So, I always encourage clients to think of their overall content pillars which do align with their values. So, really being able to think of about three to five main topic categories that they would be incorporating into their overall marketing. So ,whether it's personal content, whether it's tips, whether it's videos, really being able to outline the methods and content umbrella ultimately that they'll be using to really plan out their content marketing plan. So, one thing that I always say to clients specifically is that your marketing content in general, regardless of what method you use to deliver it, should always focus on providing value. You should provide value and you should serve your audience in some way. So, whether that's being able to educate them on something, whether that's being able to just get them to know a little bit about who you are and building that, you know like and trust factor, you always want to make sure that you're delivering something to them so that they get something out of it.\
\
[00:02:16.460] - Liz\
Okay, so we knew, because I think a lot of people struggle with that of like, well, if I'm giving everything away, how can I make this a business? So, can you provide me some examples of value without you know kind of, you know, harming the business side of things?\
\
[00:02:35.110] - Ashley\
That's a great question and something that I've also gotten asked as well. And what I say is that you can give people all of the information in the world, but whether or not they implement it is a whole other thing. So, what often happens is that you might give people a bunch of awesome tips on how to do something that relates to your business, but they'll end up following those tips, trying to get through it and then realize, oh shoot, this takes way too much time than I thought. And I also don't know how to do this, but now I'm going to hire such person to do this for me. And so, having that mindset is huge because it really helps to portray you as the expert and they're going to really appreciate the fact that you gave them all of this free information. And then when they realize that they can't do it themselves, you're going to be the first person they think of to outsource it to.\
\
[00:03:24.060] - Liz\
Yeah, and I will say because I know with the summit, a lot of information, like, you guys are going to end up with so many ideas. I see it happen every year. Make sure you attend the implementation workshop on Friday to come up with a plan to tackle it. And then you might realize when you're tackling it, you need to hire out, in which case go look at our speakers. But definitely, that will help you guys to take action because you're right, you can attend every single session, get all the information, and then do nothing. And that's the worst.\
\
[00:03:49.590] - Ashley\
Exactly.\
\
[00:03:51.340] - Liz\
Okay. So, when you're coming up with a marketing ecosystem, because it is a lot moving parts, and I've got to say I'm totally guilty of like, not doing social media, like bare minimum, if not less than that in reality. Like I've always focused on email marketing and creating blog content. I'm trying to slowly build up my YouTube. But like, how do you create like, just something that kind of sustains itself, right? Like, that's kind of what an ecosystem is.\
\
[00:04:21.610] - Ashley\
Yeah, great question. So, I think there's a few parts to it. So one, making sure that you're using more than one marketing initiative or method, so not just focusing on only social media, but making sure you're using all of the components that go into that ecosystem. Such as social media, email marketing, having a website, being able to, like you said, create videos, whatever it may be. But then also I say it's really best to be able to batch plan your content. If you just spend a few hours at the start of each month, whether it's on a Friday if that tends to be a slower day of the week for you. Or even if you just spend a Saturday just knocking it all out at once. Being able to just kind of take a few hours to plan everything, whether it's writing your social media posts, writing blog posts and scheduling them, or writing out a newsletter. Then it's kind of like a "set it and forget it" type of deal where you can just do it all at once, schedule it, and then you know it's done. That kind of really helps to take the pressure off because what I often see with business owners or bloggers is they might say, I'll just write the post tomorrow, and they try to do it day by day.\
\
[00:05:27.370] - Ashley\
But then what happens is they end up going months without anything getting posted because they just truly get busy. And so it's best to make sure that you are setting that time to be able to plan things out. So that way you know that your content is created, it's scheduled and it's getting published, and people aren't going to your profile, to your website and seeing tumbleweeds rolling by because it's been so long since you last shared an update.\
\
[00:05:50.290] - Liz\
Yes. So, I do batch. I've gotten into a bit of trouble myself lately because I like to batch excessive amounts, which I'm going to have to adjust that because now I'm a little bit troubled. But part of the reason I struggle too is, life happened.\
\
[00:06:08.400] - Ashley\
right.\
\
[00:06:08.860] - Liz\
And like really threw me off everything. So, I mean even if you're doing just a month at a time, which I think is totally doable, and I think it's a great approach and it might be one I have to go back to. Do you have any tips for you know if something happens, life happens and you're not able to get that batching day at the beginning of the month or the end of the month or whatever, of managing that and keeping things going at least for that month?\
\
[00:06:34.460] - Ashley\
Yes. So, a lot of social media schedulers, like the social media scheduler I use, which is smarter queue, with social media specifically, they have like an evergreen option, which is amazing. So, basically what you can do is you can write a bunch of social media posts but add them into this evergreen queue. You can set up a certain cycle so that way the post ultimately gets recycled and republished for whatever timeframe you want, whether it's once every three weeks or once every week, whatever you'd like to set it as, it's an amazing feature to take advantage of. So that way when things like that happen, when life gets crazy, you know that you have a content bank built up and you're not going to have to go and create new posts all the time. You can just have your scheduler pull from things that you've already planned.\
\
[00:07:19.260] - Liz\
And then that could actually probably apply to older blog content to just republish it.\
\
[00:07:24.720] - Ashley\
Yeah, exactly. That's one thing that I always recommend people do is update at least one blog post per month. Usually, I start with the oldest blog post so that way, you can update any old stats. If you have a fresh perspective on the topic, you can include that, it kind of prevents you from having to reinvent the wheel, so to say, and just be able to take something you've already written and maybe spend 20-30 minutes tops, going through and updating it as you see fit.\
\
[00:07:50.590] - Liz\
Okay. The next thing I want to kind of ask you about because I feel like it's becoming more and more prevalent in the online space is the use of AI because it can really speed things up to a certain extent. What is kind of your view on, is it useful tool? How should people be using it, so it's useful or not? You know because it can be really unuseful too but you know wjust kind of your thoughts on that?\
\
[00:08:14.190] - Ashley\
I think it can be helpful with automating but what I will say is that you have to definitely pay really close attention to what it produces. Especially with, I can't remember the name of it but I've used like an AI copywriting type of software before and the type of text that it created just didn't really seem very English, so to say, it was kind of like taking things very literally, and especially if you're writing in a more personal voice, I think that stuff gets lost in translation. And so even though it can totally help you with speeding up the content creation process, you definitely need to make sure you're keeping a close eye on it to make sure that nothing's slipping through the cracks. So, I think it's really helpful to be able to do that. One other software that I use that I guess I would consider it to be AI is Descript which is amazing. I use it for a podcast that I'm going to be launching but it's really helpful for being able to transcribe the episodes. And so again, one thing that I have to do with that is go through and double-check all of the transcription that it's pulled together because sometimes the words are just completely off based on the way that it picks up the audio.\
\
[00:09:20.920] - Ashley\
So, it is helpful in that case because otherwise, I'd be spending hours listening to the episode and typing it. But that in that sense is huge of being able to use it.\
\
[00:09:31.690] - Liz\
Okay, so I was wondering if you could maybe give an example of like value-driven marketing ecosystem of like, if this is your post and this is how you kind of pull all the pieces in.\
\
[00:09:44.470] - Ashley\
Yes. So, I like to start at the higher level or the bigger piece of content which is a blog post, typically anywhere from 750 to maybe 1500 words, give or take. With that, you have your long-form piece of content but then you want to find ways that you can repurpose it across all of the other channels. So, from that one blog post, you can pull up multiple bitesized, social media posts from it. From that one blog post you can perhaps film a short video about the topic that might be three to five minutes long, just kind of verbally sharing what it is and explaining the topic further. From that, you can also leave a link to the blog post and the newsletter that you send out and promote it that way. I mean there's so many different options that you can include. Really all that entails is making sure that you're educating your audience in some way or serving them in some way through a piece of content and making sure that you're ultimately promoting it, sharing it, and repurposing it throughout all the other channels that you have in your hands.\
\
[00:10:43.840] - Liz\
Okay. So, if you've got a blog post that you've just finished writing, do you then work on pulling out all the other pieces, or do you come back to it later?\
\
[00:10:51.790] - Ashley\
I usually pull all the other pieces out at once while it's still fresh in my head, and then I kind of just make sure that I have all of the pieces completed and done, so that way it's something I don't have to go back to.\
\
[00:11:02.610] - Liz\
Okay, what are some mistakes you see people making when it comes to trying to repurpose that content or to you know create an ecosystem?\
\
[00:11:12.110] - Ashley\
I think people tend to focus a little bit more on one medium over another. Specifically, like, we're talking about social media, generally, everyone's honing in on Instagram, and they tend to kind of forget about or discount the other platforms that are available, such as Facebook. Everyone is always so quick to kind of knock on Facebook, which I can totally understand, but for someone like me, where most of my clients come from Facebook, you really need to not discount something just because of what you're hearing other people say about it. You need to make sure that it really works for your audience, whether it's readers that you want to drive to your blog, or if you own a business, whether it's clients or customers that you want to get, make sure that you're prioritizing and researching that. And then I think also too, being able to kind of give a fresh perspective when repurposing. So, even though it is good to be able to reshare stuff you've already created, I think if there's a way to spin the post in a way where it can seem like something brand new, that might help to make your audience realize or think that it's something that they haven't seen before.\
\
[00:12:15.340] - Liz\
Yeah, because even if they've seen it, they may not have read the whole thing because people's attention spans are pretty short these days.\
\
[00:12:21.820] - Ashley\
Exactly.\
\
[00:12:22.720] - Liz\
Heck, the first year of the summit sessions were like an hour long, and now they're like ten minutes, so. Anyway, so, okay, we talked about kind of you know the value you're providing in terms of your content pillars and your topic categories. When you say provide value deliver, is that just like, hey, give them an action step? Is that, you know how clear are you in the like, here's this thing?\
\
[00:12:50.770] - Ashley\
So, I think it can depend on the content and the topic, but ultimately, you want someone to read whatever you're creating and have some type of takeaway. Whether it's a tip that they try to implement, whether you share a blog post that they want to go and read, whether you share a lead magnet or a free resource that they download and they're able to use to kind of guide them through something. You want to give them some type of clear action or step that they are able to take that will ultimately improve their life, their blog, or their business. That's ultimately the goal with the content that you create is you want to inspire someone and you want to encourage them to take action.\
\
[00:13:25.610] - Liz\
Okay. Follow up to that question, because basically what you're talking about is having a clear call to action, which is shorthand CTA often referred to that way. How do you decide what the CTA should be?\
\
[00:13:37.990] - Ashley\
I would say depend on what your goals are. So, if you want to get people to sign up for your email list, that call to action should be to download your free resource and sign up to receive it. If you want to drive website traffic, the goal should be to send people to a blog post or to another page on your website. If you want people to leave a comment, you can literally say that leave a comment in the comment section below with your thoughts. I think it just all depends on what you hope to get out of it and then making sure you continue to ask people for it. And speaking of that, it's one thing I always say to my clients, is that being able to get people to take action on it is like the same thing as being a parent. So, I say, how many times do you have to ask your kid to do something before they actually do it? And I always say to people, you have to continuously ask before someone actually does that thing. And so even though it may feel to you annoying or tedious to constantly be including the same call to action, you have to do it because the chance of the person actually doing it the first time is super slim.\
\
[00:14:40.080] - Liz\
Oh, my gosh. Like, yes. I've never thought about it that way, but I'm like, yeah, as like, you know, now I was arguing with my niece. You have to eat lunch. Why do we eat?\
\
[00:14:51.720] - Ashley\
Right?\
\
[00:14:53.290] - Liz\
And I was like because you need energy for practice. I'm not hungry, I don't. The only thing I want to eat, you won't make me.\
\
[00:14:59.960] - Ashley\
Oh, my gosh. I know.\
\
[00:15:04.760] - Liz\
Exactly [crosstalk 00:15:05].\
\
[00:15:05.300] - Ashley\
And like the first time I said that to a client, he was like, oh my God, you're right. And I'm like, exactly.\
\
[00:15:11.890] - Liz\
Oh, that is just like perfect. Okay. So, obviously, so, your call to action is going to depend on your goals. How do you balance when you have multiple goals? Right? Like, how often are you switching between different calls to action to, A, keep it fresh but also reach different goals? Like how does that balance work?\
\
[00:15:31.090] - Ashley\
I think it would depend on the season of your business or blog. So, say if you're in the season of launching something, your goal might be at that time to build your email list. So that way you have more subscribers on your list when it comes time to announce the launch of whatever it is to your audience. If things tend to be a little bit slower in the season, and maybe you just want to focus on building up some followers. That goal, you'd be creating content that helps you to reach that ultimately, but I think it kind of depends on what you're looking to do at that time and it can change over time, which is okay. As you start to reach new goals, you might set bigger ones or maybe you are a little bit ambitious and are going to end up falling short in the goal that you originally set. It's absolutely okay to be able to change that as you go through and then think about ultimately reverse engineering it, thinking about what you need to do in order to reach those goals and the calls to action that will accommodate them.\
\
[00:16:24.640] - Liz\
Okay, so it's all well and good to have call to action to be, you know, marketing all the places. How do you see what's working? What are your tips for actually checking the data and having a way to easily see what's working and you know getting you towards your goals?\
\
[00:16:43.390] - Ashley\
Google analytics is huge. So making sure you set that up and see what your bounce rate is, how many clicks people had, how many subscribers came from that one landing page. It's helpful to kind of give you a good understanding. It's especially helpful too if you're promoting a certain lead magnet on social media and you can see that social media is doing its job of constantly driving people to the website, but they're not opting in. And so that's an indication to you that something needs to be fixed on that website in order to be able to capture the people who have shown interest in downloading the resource and convert them. So that's really helpful with kind of being able to identify problems that might be happening within your marketing and really being able to give you an inside look into what you need to adjust in order to help you reach those goals that you've set.\
\
[00:17:36.110] - Liz\
Okay. Just couple of follow ups to that because Google Analytics is insanely powerful if you can figure out how to use it.\
\
[00:17:42.930] - Ashley\
Right.\
\
[00:17:43.440] - Liz\
Beyond just installing it, right, because you can do goals, you can do. I'm just curious if you know of any good resources, you know, that can help people to better use Google Analytics or if you have any of those. I don't know, but just because it can be a beast, especially when you're trying to figure it out with the social media and you could do utms and is it converting, and yeah.\
\
[00:18:05.020] - Ashley\
Yeah. So I took it like a million years ago. But Google does have like some type of certification and courses and things like that that they share. But honestly, I say for me, what works well with getting to know any type of new platform is honestly just trying it. Like, I like to try things out and kind of get a feel for it because I feel like I could watch a video or read an article, but actually going ahead and trying it, I end up understanding it a little bit more. It's also helpful to perhaps hire a consultant. If you want to hire someone to set it up for you and then maybe do a session with them one on one to walk you through the process, that will definitely help to take some time off your hands.\
\
[00:18:43.290] - Liz\
Yes. Especially, they can just set it up so that you can just see the result, like the data.\
\
[00:18:48.410] - Ashley\
Exactly. Like I don't care how this is working. I just want to know what this stuff means.\
\
[00:18:53.810] - Liz\
Yes. Yes. Okay. Any final tips for someone who's struggling to kind of create a cohesive marketing plan?\
\
[00:19:00.790] - Ashley\
I say to start small, because that is a really big struggle that bloggers and business owners have is, they try to do all the things everywhere, all at once, and it gets really overwhelming, and depending on your schedule, might even seem impossible to do. So, people think that they need to be on every single social media platform that exists and be posting every single day. But with that, I say really understand who your target market is and what platforms they're using, and then hone in on those platforms. You can also start small with the amount of content that you create. So, even if you're just publishing one social media post per week, one newsletter per quarter, one blog post per month, that's okay, because you're still being consistent in showing up. And I always say that consistency is much more important and means more than frequency. So, once you really start to kind of get comfortable with all of these different moving parts and you feel good about it, then you can increase the frequency and start to post more often, or perhaps try a new marketing method or whatever it may be. But you definitely want to start small, because doing everything all at once, right off the bat is what will cause you to burn out and just drop it completely.\
\
[00:20:11.210] - Liz\
Awesome. Okay. Where can people learn more about you? Is there somewhere specific you want to send them?\
\
[00:20:18.190] - Ashley\
Yeah, absolutely. So, you can go to my website, which is Dashofsocial.com. On that website, you'll find a resource you can download, which is called Build Your Content Marketing Bank, which is super helpful to download and covers pretty much everything Liz and I just chatted about. You can also follow me along on social media at Dash of Social on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\
\
[00:20:42.410] - Liz\
Alright. Awesome. Guys, definitely, go check her out. I actually probably need to download that because, as I said, I am only doing small parts of marketing when I really should be doing more. So, Ashley, thank you so much. Appreciate you being here. And if people have questions, you know they can always find you, like you said, on social media or ask away in the comments, and we'll be sure to get you guys some answers.\
\
[00:21:03.330] - Ashley\
Awesome. Thank you, Liz.\

[00:00:11.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host\

\
[00:00:43.240] - Ashley Mason\
Liz, thank you for having me.\
\
[00:00:45.540] - Liz\
Okay, so let's dive into first, what elements are necessary when you want to create a well-rounded social media strategy.\
\
[00:00:56.070] - Ashley\
Yes, great thinking. So in terms of social media, people often think that all that they have to do is write a post, publish it, and that's it. But it really goes into so much more. So, with having a well-rounded social media strategy, it comes into doing a competitor analysis to see what others online are doing in the space that's working well for them, that might not be working well for them, and knowing where you stand and benchmark yourselves against them. It also comes down to really understanding which platforms you're using. So, just because a social media platform exists doesn't mean that you need to be on every single one. But it also doesn't mean that you should only focus on just one, i.e. Instagram. Many people are inclined to look just at Instagram and nowhere else. Having a well-rounded strategy comes down to having probably at least 2-3 platforms that you can start to build an audience on. It also involves looking at your analytics to see what's working well, and being able to use that information to imitate that success moving forward, based on what you know your audience likes to see. And then lastly, it really comes down to thinking about content that will engage, educate, inspire, and cause someone to take action through whatever you'd like them to do with your business or with your blog.\
\
[00:02:11.440] - Liz\
Alright. So, really you're looking at four different kinds of content or four different aims with whatever content you're creating. As you said, engage, educate, inspire, and take action.\
\
[00:02:22.450] - Ashley\
Yes.\
\
[00:02:23.500] - Liz\
And you mentioned try to just stick with 2-3 platforms. I mean, because it's constantly changing. There's Threads. I don't know anything about Threads, I haven't gotten on there yet. I don't know if you know anything. There's the video-based TikTok. Where do you see social media in 2024 going as it's evolving and changing, and Twitter is now X? And there was a lot that happened this last year.\
\
[00:02:48.900] - Ashley\
Yes, there definitely has been. I feel like this has been a trend for the past few years, but really it all comes down to video. I mean, people want to see the person that they'd be doing business with or getting to know face to face. Really it comes down to that human interaction. So whether that's allowing someone to hear your voice and see your facial expressions, or whether that's showing photos of yourself and being able to resonate with your audience that way. I think for a long time there was this stigma ultimately, or this preconceived notion that business had to be strictly business and you couldn't have any personal integration into that. But things have totally shifted and now people really resonate with and interact with brands that are more humanized. And so being able to incorporate more of that content into your overall presence can do a lot. I mean, an example of how that happens for me is that every time I read a book, and I'm a very big reader, every time I read a book, I post an Instagram story of the book that I'm currently reading. And that content gets the most engagement out of anything else that I post, whether it's about social media or what have you. It's like people just love to see your interests and see your passions and know who you are as a human. And that's what helps to build those close relationships that can convert down the line.\
\
[00:04:06.880] - Liz\
Well, now I have to ask, what book are you reading?\
\
[00:04:08.830] - Ashley\
So I am currently finishing up Rouge, I think it's called. I'm a very big thriller reader, so I tend to gravitate towards that.\
\
[00:04:19.040] - Liz\
Nice. Okay, back to social media and marketing and value-driven, well-rounded strategies. So, video is where it's at. I have not mastered video, especially for reels and stuff like that. Do you have any tips on how to get started with that? Any tools that make it simpler? I'm a millennial, don't blame everything on me, and Instagram is like a struggle. I feel like kids [crosstalk 00:04:47] definitely can figure out Instagram better than I can. And by kids, I mean my eight-year-old nephew probably could. So, any advice there or tips or tools, or things to get going in that way for social media?\
\
[00:05:00.760] - Ashley\
Yeah. So, I would say to think about what content you're planning can be video. So, for me, I do a lot of brain dumps for both myself and my clients, where I'll just think of a bunch of different post topics, and then I'll go through those topics and I'll identify which ones could be good video content. So first, you have to get into the habit of making to-do videos in the first place. But it really all comes down to the preparation I think. If you're not used to recording videos or not comfortable with recording videos, having a list of talking points is key. Because a lot of times when people start hitting the record button, they're just like, 'Uh', and they just don't know what to say. So, I would say having a list of talking points is crucial. But I would also say to not necessarily write up a script because it is very obvious when someone is reading word for word. And so, if you can come up with a few bullet points just to keep yourself on track, that's awesome. I also say that with video, aim towards having a shorter length compared to longer. I mean, attention spans are so short nowadays that you want to make things concise. And so, it, of course, depends on the content, that will determine the length. But I say really anywhere from maybe one to two minutes is the sweet spot, just to make sure that you're captivating your audience and ensuring that they're watching the whole thing. I would also say to use a tool like Descript, which I love. It's great for video editing, and it's also great for transcriptions and captions. Captions are a must because so many people watch videos with the sound off because videos often play with the sound off. And so, you want to make sure that people who are watching your video, who may not have their volume on, are still being able to understand the content and read along with you and you're not losing out on opportunities that way.\
\
[00:06:49.360] - Liz\
Okay, I like that. So, you said one to two minutes. I feel like stuff is going more toward a portrait rather than a landscape video, unless you're doing YouTube or something.\
\
[00:07:00.310] - Ashley\
Yeah.\
\
[00:07:02.730] - Liz\
It sounds like you're saying go ahead and just start with face to camera, chat it out content. Are there any other tools or tips you would have for other types of video content just to have that variety?\
\
[00:07:16.020] - Ashley\
Yeah, I would say definitely tips. So, one of my favorite, I guess, processes for being able to come up with post topics, whether it's video or not, is to actually think about questions and problems that your ideal audience is asking you or facing, because that can easily turn into video content, so truly answering that question. I also love to use video content to promote stuff. So, I've been hosting monthly webinars on a variety of topics, and each month I'll create just a short promo or trailer to talk about the upcoming webinar and just share more information about what's happening within it. I also think if you're someone who might be in a service-based business, if you are working with clients and are looking to have testimonials, getting them to go on camera and say their testimonials is huge and it holds a lot of weight. I think also being able to incorporate other experts or other people within your video content can go a long way as well.\
\
[00:08:10.040] - Liz\
Awesome. No, I like that. Let's walk through what the process would be. You brain dump, you come up with ideas, some that can be video. I'm assuming you batch, and this isn't a batching session, so we won't dig into that super heavily. How often are you posting? That depends on how much content you're creating, I'm sure, but what sort of consistency? And does it matter by platform? Does it matter if, 'Oh, I need to do a video one day, I post the next'? What variation do you recommend or see works well?\
\
[00:08:48.660] - Ashley\
Great question. So, I always say that consistency is so much more important than frequency. And really, that depends on the person who's creating the content. So, if you can only commit to one post per week because that's all that your schedule or your time allows, then that's fine. Because what matters is that you're showing up consistently one time per week. I think oftentimes business owners or bloggers tend to just dive right in full force and try to create all this content for every single day, and they very quickly burn out and then ditch everything altogether. So it's much better to take things slow and start off with that one to two posts per week. And then, once you get comfortable with creating more content and you are in a good groove and you have the capacity to create more content, then you can increase that cadence. So, it comes down to that, and it also comes down to what your analytics are saying. You definitely want to make sure that you're creating your content and posting your content on the days where your audience is most engaged, which every social media platform has that information for you, which is great. So, you're able to see the most popular days and the most popular times. And so, of course, you want to take advantage of that popularity and ensure that you're captivating people when they're hot ultimately. And so being able to cater your schedule to that, I think can make a really big impact.\
\
[00:10:06.240] - Liz\
Let's pause. Show me where I would find that information in a platform if you don't mind. And I'll share my screen if you want to walk me through it. We'll do Instagram, I guess, because I'm terrible at it.\
\
[00:10:20.560] - Ashley\
So, Instagram, unfortunately, it's only on mobile, so you might need to do Facebook. [crosstalk 00:10:24] \
\
[00:10:26.650] - Liz\
Oh. Okay. So should I go to the Meta business suite?\
\
[00:10:29.900] - Ashley\
Yeah, you could. \
\
[00:10:32.260] - Liz\
Okay, let's do that. Let me pull it up and then I'll share my screen.\
\
[00:10:34.930] - Ashley\
Actually, Meta business suite will show Instagram, but Instagram itself doesn't have that on it.\
\
[00:10:40.080] - Liz\
Sure. Okay. [crosstalk 00:10:43] I always love a real-time this is where you find it kind of a thing. Okay.\
\
[00:10:48.640] - Ashley\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:49.650] - Liz\
[inaudible 00:10:52] What is it? It's being weird. There we go. Okay. It's because I've got multiple screens going. Alrighty. So, you can see I don't do much at all with Facebook or Instagram. But that's okay, guys. I'm consistent with my Summit every year. Okay. So, we're looking at Insights would be my best guess?\
\
[00:11:12.780] - Ashley\
Yes. So this is perfect. So, at the top, where you'll see the last 28 days, you can actually get granular and specific about the time frame that you want to look at, which is nice. With a client yesterday, we went through the five months that I've been managing their social media, which is cool. So, if you want to look at a certain time of year, you can also compare it to a previous time of year to see how things have changed and whatnot. But if your Instagram account and Facebook page are connected to this, then you'll be able to see reach, which is the number of people who saw your posts, Facebook page likes, or Facebook followers, as well as Instagram followers and the growth there. Messaging is if people message your page. And then they also have video summary at the bottom, which is perfect because we were just talking about video, but it'll show zero \
\
[00:12:00.250] - Liz\
Well, this is for my page, though. Okay.\
\
[00:12:03.480] - Ashley\
Yeah, it'll show interactions on video content.\
\
[00:12:06.590] - Liz\
Okay, for my Facebook page. I don't think I posted any videos. But for anyone who's not familiar, this is totally free. You can just connect yourself to it. So, is there a way to know when my audience is most active? Where would I look for that?\
\
[00:12:23.790] - Ashley\
I'm honestly not sure where it is on Meta itself.\
\
[00:12:31.300] - Liz\
Sure\
\
[00:12:31.400] - Ashley\
But I mean with Instagram.\
\
[00:12:31.730] - Liz\
I'm putting you on the spot.\
\
[00:12:33.360] - Ashley\
It's all good. Usually, I do it through Instagram, with being able to look at the times. And usually, Facebook and Instagram are pretty aligned with that. So, with Instagram, let me walk through it on my app and I can verbally talk about it.\
\
[00:12:51.340] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:12:52.420] - Ashley\
So, with Instagram, you'd want to click on the Insights under your profile.\
\
[00:12:58.302] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:12:58.590] - Ashley\
Then you'd want to scroll down and you'd actually want to change to the content that you shared, and then you'd be able to see the different days and times. So, it's really helpful for being able to understand when people are looking at your stuff, which is nice.\
\
[00:13:17.290] - Liz\
Okay. Yeah. So, make a habit of digging into your data, guys. I do for other parts of my business, I don't for social media, which could be part of why I don't do well on social media. Okay. So yeah. Do you have a list of data points you recommend people keep track of when it comes to their social media and figuring out the best strategy and what's working for them?\
\
[00:13:44.380] - Ashley\
Yes. So, people are always caught up in the number of followers and the number of likes, which I say both are vanity metrics. Because just anyone can follow you, but it doesn't mean that they're engaging with your content or that they're actually the right fit for your audience. Same with likes. I mean, everyone mindlessly scrolls through their feed and double taps. So, it doesn't actually mean that they're particularly interested in the content. I'd say what holds the most weight is really those more action-triggered responses. So, whether it's someone commenting on a post, whether it's someone sharing your post, whether it's someone clicking a link from your post, which you can see; perhaps someone looking at your post and then following you, that means something more. Because the fact is that your content inspired them to now stay in the loop with you. But I'd say looking at anything that inspires people or encourages people to take that next step is huge.\
\
[00:14:37.510] - Liz\
Okay. And that's going to obviously what specific analytic data point is going to vary by platform.\
\
[00:14:45.000] - Ashley\
Yes\
\
[00:14:45.230] - Liz\
So, dig into your analytics, figure out what those engagement metrics look like in the platform that you're focused on, and then have a, I like to call them data dates. And dig into that set of recurring calendar notices for yourself or something like that or your task management.\
\
[00:15:03.310] - Ashley\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:15:04.950] - Liz\
Okay. So, let me go back to questions I had. Okay. So, we talked about digging into the data, using video, engage, educate, inspire, and take action. It's really what you're trying to do. How do you reflect your business values and stuff as you do that? I don't know if you have any tips on that, because obviously if you're trying to get them to engage, educate, inspire, and take action, you want to be on the same level as them. I mean, yes, you're teaching them something, but you don't want to be hoity-toity - 'I believe this'.\
\
[00:15:42.300] - Ashley\
Yeah\
\
[00:15:42.100] - Liz\
I don't know if you have any tips for blending all those things together.\
\
[00:15:46.670] - Ashley\
Yeah. I think what really helps is sharing a client success story or something along those lines, because ultimately you want people to read content and envision themselves actually having that content apply to them. So, you want people to read your posts and be like, 'Wow, this is me', or 'Wow, I totally resonate with that'. And I think being able to have those real-life examples of someone who's gone there before can help to paint the picture a little bit better. And I think it also comes back to humanizing your content, like I mentioned earlier, where if you keep things very strictly business and very professional, I think you have that hierarchy sense that's built. And you don't want to have this power over someone. You want to be at the same level with them. And so being able to incorporate more of that human aspect, I think, can really help people to feel like they know you, like you, and trust you, which is huge for getting them to take that next step.\
\
[00:16:41.200] - Liz\
Yes, I 100 % agree with that. Like I said, every year I say I'm going to do better at my social media, and every year I just get bogged down on other things. Do you have any advice on making it a priority and actually getting it done?\
\
[00:16:54.570] - Ashley\
Yes. So, what we mentioned earlier, what you alluded to earlier, batching is key. I mean, even if you can only set one hour a week, just as long as you get social media posts done for either that week or for the following week, can really set you up in the long run. Because I think what happens with a lot of business owners or bloggers is if they say, 'Oh, I'll write this today, I'll write this today', it just doesn't happen because, like you said, other things come up and priorities come up. And so, I think being able to have a dedicated time each week that you do that is huge. I mean, for me, I actually use Thursdays and Fridays as my admin days where I'll plan my own content for the upcoming week or even the upcoming month, and that's really helpful to see. And I also recommend being able to use some type of project management system or anything like that to help you plan everything out. I personally love using Asana for mapping out my entire marketing calendar. So, actually, I finished it for the year a few weeks ago, but I mapped out my social media post each week; what my blog post would be each month; what's going in my newsletters every other week, and just had that bird's eye view, which now allows me to be strategic and intentional about what I'm posting and when, and not just posting something just to post something. Because I think that's also another thing that people do is they're like, 'Well, I got to post something. Let me just post this'. They don't really think too much about it. But I think sitting and dedicating the time to actually think about your strategy moving forward can really do a lot for you.\
\
[00:18:20.700] - Liz\
Okay, so the elephant in the room is AI, which is automating social media. And I mean, there's been schedulers and things for ever since social media started being a thing, I guess.\
\
[00:18:34.570] - Ashley\
yeah\
\
[00:18:35.120] - Liz\
What is your thought on the way you could possibly use AI to help you and ways you shouldn't? Because I think that's just as important.\
\
[00:18:45.120] - Ashley\
Yes\
\
[00:18:45.220] - Liz\
And then just thoughts on Evergreen, because I use SocialBee and there's a lot of those out there where it just re-queues things. So, there's stuff going on and it's all good content. But what is your thought in that regard in terms of Evergreen, re-queuing things, and AI?\
\
[00:19:08.110] - Ashley\
Yeah, absolutely. So, with AI, in terms of what you should not do, as I say, not use AI to completely write a post for you. Because I think what ends up happening is that unless you give a very specific prompt, then you're going to end up with content that is very clearly written by AI and doesn't really sound like you at all. I think what you should use AI for is idea generation. It's really helpful for thinking of content topics or even bullet points to go within posts that you then expand upon and write about yourself. It's also helped me with research and ideas too. For example, I just used it last week for a client where I was pulling together a Facebook ad audience for them, and I was looking for, I want to say it was people who work in theater, and I just couldn't think of demographics or interests to get more targeted. So, I went into ChatGPT. I was like, build me a Facebook ad audience that targets theater directors, and it came up with really great and helpful starting points, ultimately. I didn't use that exactly, but it helped me to think about what I wanted to do moving forward. And so, I think oftentimes as business owners and bloggers, we get stuck sometimes. And so, I think if you need some inspiration or something to get you going, it's a good use in that sense. In terms of re-queuing or using Evergreen content, I think that's definitely great if you are strapped for time and don't have the time to be able to create new content. I will say just to go through, I'd say maybe once or twice a year, maybe at the beginning of the year, or in the middle of the year to refresh it. Make sure that none of that content is old or if it's stale, if you feel like it's been reshared a lot, you could possibly swap it out. But I would say to look at that aspect, and I'd also say to just check the number of times something is shared. When I reshare something through my Evergreen, I have it set up so that the same post is not posted twice within a six-week period or something like that. You don't want people to see the same post daily, but it's definitely great for ensuring that you're staying consistent and that something's there if people happen to pop across your profiles if you don't have the time.\
\
[00:21:15.300] - Liz\
Okay. I think, last question then we'll wrap it up. Most platforms allow you to pin something as the first posts of yours people will see, or there's some sort of story type of daily thing, content that expires. Do you have any tips on the best way to take advantage of those features that exist on various platforms?\
\
[00:21:40.900] - Ashley\
Yeah. I would say the pinpost is the content that's great for explaining who you are, what you do, and how you help. Because that's the first post that people will see, you want to make sure it's something that will instantly resonate with your audience right off the bat, and validate why they're there and why they're going to your profile. I think if you're also promoting something, having it as the pinpost is great because, of course, it's that highly sought-after first thought. And so, again, people will see that right away. In terms of stories, I think that's great for showing more so, I don't want to necessarily say messy, but that off-the-cuff, behind-the-scenes type of content that doesn't necessarily need to go in your feed and have a more permanent place, but still gives people the opportunity to learn more about who you are, what you do, and how you help, again. So, for me, I love to use stories about, again, the books that I'm reading. I run a lot, so I'll post the runs that I do on Peloton. I also showcase the food that I like to eat on weekends because I'm a foodie and I like to go out to eat a lot. I'll also showcase my process for working with clients. I might show what an inside look into a social media strategy is. And so, I think just using that feature to allow people to know you on a deeper, more intimate level can again help to build those relationships that lead to some type of conversion further down the line.\
\
[00:22:59.510] - Liz\
Okay. Fantastic. Well, I will stop myself from asking more questions just because we are short on time. Where should people find you? I think you've got something for our wonderful attendees. Please share.\
\
[00:23:12.790] - Ashley\
Yes, absolutely. So, you can find me at dashofsocial.com. You can also find me at Dash of Social on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. And the freebie that I have is a content marketing bank where basically if you download it, you'll get access to all of this helpful information on several different pieces of content that you can create for your business or blog.\
\
[00:23:33.020] - Liz\
Fantastic, I'm going to actually make sure I get that for myself. Alright, guys. So, if you haven't been to Ashley's site or her social media, go check it out. As you can tell, she knows her stuff. I just need to get better at actually implementing the things I learned from her. Ashley, again, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:23:55.290] - Ashley\
Thank you again for having me, Liz.\

[00:00:09.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host, elizabethstapleton.com\
All right, guys, I'm really excited with the session with Breonna Queen, who is a video strategist and YouTuber. Breonna, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate you taking the time.\
\
[00:00:20.740] - Breonna Queen, www.breonnaqueen.com\
Thank you for having me.\
\
[00:00:22.840] - Liz\
In case anyone doesn't know you, you want to give them just a little bit on your b background and how you got to where you are.\
\
[00:00:29.340] - Breonna\
Yes, again, my name is Breonna Queen, I am in video strategist as well as a YouTuber, content creator. I started off just helping other businesses grow their online presence and I had a business reach out to me and say, "Hey, you want to be on YouTube?" So I started a YouTube channel just to help my client and my YouTube channel actually end up like I guess booming. And today I have over 85,000 subscribers, over three million views. I've been featured in like Own as well as HBO and Bus, all those great things. So, I really focus on like DIY type of videos like YouTube so I can really help you grow your visibility as well as your impact.\
\
[00:01:08.730] - Liz\
Yeah, because I feel like a lot of people don't realize that YouTube is its own search engine.\
\
[00:01:12.890] - Breonna\
Yes.\
\
[00:01:13.470] - Liz\
So, there's a lot of opportunity for growth. So, if you're going to be creating content for our blog, why not use YouTube to help leverage your blog and everything? Okay, so when it comes to- how can YouTube really help your blog? I mean, we touched on it a little bit. It's a- it's a search engine. But how can you really kind of connect those two?\
\
[00:01:33.040] - Breonna\
So, I love adding YouTube videos to my blog post for Run, it's great for SEO. Now YouTube loves- not even YouTube Google because Google owns YouTube- Google loves, loves, loves videos and have a blog post and you have a video, you're more likely to rank higher than your competitor, who might also have a blog post the the same exact link as yours. Another great thing is it gives you double visibility because Google is the first biggest search engine and then YouTube second. So, if someone is typing out the best chicken noodle soup ever, they might discover your blog. They may discover your YouTube channel. When you combine those both together you get even more chance of somebody actually discovering you. So, I love adding my YouTube videos to my blog post. And then in the same breath, I love adding my blog post to my YouTube videos. So, I'll say on my YouTube video check out the blog post and I'll say in the blog post, check out the YouTube video, because people like to learn differently. So people like to learn like visual as in seeing and some like to learn visually as in reading. So, why not give the people both?\
\
[00:02:35.290] - Liz\
Yes, more opportunities. Okay, so what are- because YouTube is just like blogging is it's a learning curve. YouTube's kind of its own learning curve, too. What are some sort of like settings or things you can do to kind of set yourself up, right? I guess.\
\
[00:02:52.750] - Breonna\
So, when you're first starting your YouTube channel, I always tell people do not focus on subscribers like that is a vanity metric. Do not focus on that. Focus on really one becoming comfortable on camera. And just like you need a niche when you're blogging, you need a niche for your YouTube channel to. So, if you're really going to be leveraging YouTube for your blog, obviously you want to have the same exact niche. But really think about how can you put yourself out there in front of your audience so that you can really connect with them because blogging is all about building a community and so is having a YouTube channel.\
\
[00:03:23.440] - Breonna\
So I always tell people, think about how can impact people via video, like with your blog post and really just build a community.\
\
[00:03:33.040] - Liz\
OK, so when you're and I kind of want to talk about the technical aspect of YouTube a little bit, because I think if you don't know what you're doing is a little confusing. I know like the first time I started publishing YouTube videos, I didn't know I could schedule them, so... So what are some things you need to pay attention to when you're getting ready to publish a video sort of just on the back end to make sure it does? Well, what are some things you can do?\
\
[00:03:57.680] - Breonna\
So the most important thing is your thumbnail. Your thumbnail is that picture that shows up when someone is searching. Are they going through their YouTube homepage? The thumbnail is so important. I find the best thumbnails are ones that feature your face. So you really want to focus on really great attention grabbing thumbnails where people are going to, like, stop scroll and say, "Oh, I'm going to click on this video right here." That's the one thing you will do. Second thing that's really important is your title, just like a title is super important for your blog post. Same thing for your YouTube video. So you want to have a YouTube title that's one going to let Google and YouTube know what the video's about, as well as let people know what it's about if they want to click on it. So, for example, you can have a title tag and it's called a time tag, just like blogging and you can have a title tag in. It is How to Make Chicken Noodle Soup. But in the title tag is the best chicken soup in the world. That one makes you want to be like, "Oh, is the best chicken noodle soup in the world. Let me click it." And it also lets YouTube know this is about chicken noodle soup. So, really think about how can you create title tags that make you want to click on it as well as like Google AdWords like what know the video is about. And the third thing is your description. The same way with a blog post you can have that content. Same with the YouTube channel. That little description like your name and what the video is about, it's basically another way to optimize your videos. So, focus on that as well. So, focus on the thumbnail up the title as well as a description. Inside of description just you again want to again add what the video is about and how your audience can connect better with you because you create this amazing video. People like, "Oh my gosh, she's amazing." And they click on a description- give them something to do. Say, "Hey, follow my Instagram or follow my blog post." Give them a CTA in the video as well as inside a description.\
\
[00:05:45.850] - Liz\
And correct me if I'm wrong, but you can actually do like a default description, which you can use sort of as your outline to help make you remember all the things you need to include.\
\
[00:05:53.590] - Breonna\
Yes, you can.\
\
[00:05:55.460] - Liz\
Okay, I learned that last year from one of our YouTube sessions. Okay. So- and then the other thing I want to ask you about sort of on the back end, is there tags you can- how important are tags that you add or don't add or...?\
\
[00:06:09.100] - Breonna\
YouTube came out this year and they the tags are not that important. I think they still are. I'm currently testing it out; but this year YouTube said the tags are not as- they don't help with brand. That's what you need to know this year. So, that's why I really focusing on that title tag as well as that description if YouTube is prioritizing title tags- well tags this year.\
\
[00:06:30.030] - Liz\
Okay, got you. I just want to ask about that. Okay, and then once you've got the video, you've got your description, your awesome channel- the video art thumbnail. I can think of words I'm sure. What do you need to do after you hit publish to try to make it successful?\
\
[00:06:48.250] - Breonna\
So you want to promote your video on the platform as well as off the platform. So, the same with blogging, you tend to like- I know with me whenever I create a blog post, I always put on Pinterest like that is like you have to put a pin out. You don't need to. Create your YouTube video and and create pins on Pinterest for your YouTube video, post it on social media, like Facebook, like Instagram, like your blog. So, not an email. I think I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's like sixty percent like that's the- people are more likely to click on an email if video is in the title. So, how many email that says, you know, I have a new video, especially if you don't create videos. If you do not create videos, and you let your email list know like, "Hey, guys, I'm doing a video now." I guarantee you're going to get some new clicks. So, like, really just promoted the same with your blog post from on your social media. And then on the platform, you want to obviously do the title tag and description. And then if you know people who are on YouTube, send a message, or send them a comment saying, "Hey, I love this video." Don't spam." Actually watch the video, say, "Hey, I love your video." I also created a video similar to this. Let me know what you think. So, just really just promote it any way you can the same with the blog post, but don't spammy. I always want to say that, don't be spammy.\
\
[00:08:02.320] - Liz\
Always be authentic and genuine; like you're going to get so much further away. People can tell when you're spam. Okay, so YouTube, if you're just getting started, you can't monetize YouTube the way you can a blog. I mean, you're not going to get a lot of money because not a lot of traffic. Right. But so- do you have any tips on sort of getting to the point where you can monetize and is there any instance where you wouldn't want to kind of turn on that monetization channel on YouTube?\
\
[00:08:32.380] - Breonna\
Right. So, I actually have like a program that's called, like YouTube coins. And it's literally how to make money on YouTube if you have a small channel, if you're not monetized. Because as someone who is monetized, I honestly do not make majority of my money with that. Majority of my money comes from digital products and digital services. So, you can have a brand-new spanking channel. If you have 10 subscribers, on a YouTube channel and you have a course that's a thousand dollars. In fact, people buy that that's $5000 dollars from 10 people on your list. So, I would say the best way to make money with YouTube, if you have a new channel, or a small channel is really just selling your services or products. If you want to be monetized. I know it was like a thousand people and 4000 watch time; they always change it. But you can't- you can't make that a goal. But I want to say, as someone who has ad revenue, it's not that much. You make a lot more money promoting your service or product...\
\
[00:09:31.590] - Liz\
It's like a bonus.\
\
[00:09:33.420] - Breonna\
Yes, and the thing is, you can't really control how much money you make with ads, because when covid hit a lot of- a lot of super CPMs, you drop. So you may have made $20 CPM. And then when that happened, you're now making like $5 CPM. So, also take effect that you don't have any control over that but your digital products and services. You don't have to drop the amount of money that you charge for that. So, I do want to also throw it out there that yes, you can make money with AdSense, if that's something you want to do. But again, maybe as a bonus focus on selling your products or services.\
\
[00:10:05.910] - Liz\
Okay, what about affiliate marketing with YouTube?\
\
[00:10:10.310] - Breonna\
Amazing, just like with the blogs. So, I think affiliate income is great if you are doing any type of educational or lifestyle. So, if you're doing cooking, then the best way to win money may be, oh, about this amazing- let's pretend this is a baking powder. Oh this baking powder is organic and then providing that down below and then also not interviews but reviews are a great way to make money with affiliate marketing as well. And that is where I find having a blog comes in handy, because if you're doing a blog post, that's all about reviewing a type of mascara, having a video where you go really in-depth and obviously, like, give people even more like initiatives to actually buy and click the link.\
\
[00:10:55.910] - Liz\
Yeah, no, because I know when I, when I search for like a review, I'll, I'll look at video and I'm like, yeah, let me see them actually walk through it. So, it's a matter of thinking about how you use YouTube as well. I think a lot of people lose sight of how. You know, just because as content creators, we use things differently, like we really do, we forget that people do things that we're like, "Why would they do that?" And they're like, "Oh, because they're not in this, you know? So, remembering that, Okay. Do you have any sort of like systems or sort of you always use a template? Do you have anything that helps kind of speed up the time YouTube can take because any type of content creation takes that quality takes time?\
\
[00:11:40.780] - Breonna\
Yeah. So, I only took a day and I record all of my content for the month. So, I take the day and I focus in my program. We record four videos in one day so we change our outfit for each video and that's it. And then I will edit the videos or have my editor edit the videos and then from there I'll have her take out little clips of the video and those are social media posts. Then also adding video to Ajay TV and adding that video to Facebook and add a little clip to Pinterest. So the great thing about YouTube is that you really can repurpose your content. And I also have a podcast, and my podcast is literally just the YouTube video and it's just the audio. So, you can take- and then you can also get it transcribed. So, you can pay rev.com and have them transcribe that YouTube video and then as a blog post. And, you know, just formatting it to where it reads like a blog post. Taking a video you can literally make it so many different pieces of content just from one video. So, it doesn't mean that- it does not take me that long to actually create content for my YouTube channel. In one day I throw out four videos, have those edited and then turn into a Podcast episode, turning to email, turn into Instagram post, Ajay TV post, and then make it into a blog post by transcribing it.\
\
[00:12:59.400] - Liz\
Okay. I do want to ask a different question. You said you pull out clips? Do you ever post the full video like on Instagram TV or Facebook or whatnot?\
\
[00:13:07.890] - Breonna\
Absolutely, because I don't focus on ad revenue and if you was trying to get paid through YouTube ads, then you probably would not vote for me. My main objective was making money through my services and products and affiliate marketing. So I absolutely add my entire video to Ajay TV and to Facebook. Because while I love YouTube it's not our responsibility to build up other platforms.\
\
[00:13:30.600] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:13:30.730] - Breonna\
If someone's on Ajay TV, they don't want to go to your- go to YouTube and watch the video. Just give it to them there. So, I definitely put my YouTube videos on all the other platforms and people actually watch it.\
\
[00:13:40.720] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay. I'm so terrible Instagram- it's really bad. So- so when you're uploading to Instagram TV, like, are you putting in like the YouTube link and it pulls from there or are you uploading the full video?\
\
[00:13:55.580] - Breonna\
I upload the full video. So, Facebook has Facebook creative space. You can Google that. I take thirty minutes and I take my YouTube videos, my schedule them for Ajay TV because the great- thank you. Instagram and Facebook- then you can actually schedule your videos. So, just like you can schedule your videos for YouTube. So, when I schedule my videos on YouTube, I'll schedule the same exact videos to my Ajay TV and then have a post on there as well as Facebook.\
\
[00:14:20.670] - Liz\
Okay, no, that makes sense. I was just curious because I know when you're doing like text content, you don't want to post the full thing because it messes with SEO. But video is different. And so I just want to clarify that. Okay, awesome. Make sure I've got sorry, I look at my notes, I take notes, I'm such a nerd. Okay, so you do schedule, do you as a one video a week, is it when you're growing, do you want to do more than that?\
\
[00:14:48.600] - Breonna\
Like, how do you decide what your publishing calendar is going to look like? I think it's your goal. If your goal is you're like, I want to have a 100,000 subscribers by the end of this year and I want to be a pro for you to do three videos and three videos a week like that's going to get you there faster. But for me, I do one a week, I don't have all this time dedicated to creating all these videos every single week.\
\
[00:15:13.340] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:15:13.720] - Breonna\
So, it all depends on your goals. If you just want to start a YouTube channel and you want to grow it into a community. You don't have to rush, especially if you're new. It's going to be really overwhelming. But I say at least do one a week. Try one a week, if not do twice, twice a month. I think that works when you're just getting started. Really Strafford one a week. And it has to be very high quality because when you're just creating videos, I got to do three videos out a week, you start to produce fluff and it doesn't really help. People are going to go "Ew! Yuk!" They're going to close out of it and they're not going to do anything with you. So, really, at least one week in it being high quality.\
\
[00:15:48.510] - Liz\
Does it need to be a certain length, like how long the video needs to be? Like you don't want fluff.\
\
[00:15:54.120] - Breonna\
Right. No. I think whatever- however long it takes you to to produce great- a great video, do it. If it takes you five minutes to talk about the benefit of this bottle, then, so be it. If it takes 20 minutes, then so be it. I always say it doesn't matter how long the video is, as long as you provide high quality content within the video.\
\
[00:16:18.870] - Liz\
Okay. Then when you're scheduling them out, is there a certain time of day that it's better to publish or does that matter?\
\
[00:16:26.440] - Breonna\
It depends on your audience, like if your audience is entrepreneurs then you probably want to post two o'clock in the afternoon when they have the time where our mothers. If your target market is work, mothers who work there they're probably not going to watch your video at one o'clock in the afternoon, they're probably working. So, I think it depends on your audience. Think about what time will my audience be able to watch this video. If my audience is business owners and they may have the 11:00 a.m. time to watch it? If my audience is work, know professional mothers who have a corporate job at 1:00 p.m., it's not going to work for them. So, it really depends on your audience.\
\
[00:17:02.260] - Liz\
Okay. All right. Let me see if I have any other questions I really want to dive into. Is there is there anything we haven't covered that you're like people need to know this?\
\
[00:17:14.800] - Breonna\
Two things I want to call out. You do not need a fancy camera at the start. Most of us have a camera- a phone that has great quality, audio as well as visual. Use your phone when you're starting off. When I first started my YouTube channel I use my cracked iPhone four and I got my first 10,000 followers from a cracked iPhone four. So, do not feel like you have to have the best equipment to start. You really don't. Focus more on the quality of the content that you're producing over the camera quality. That's the firs thing I want to call that. And the second thing I want to call out and this is my final day is progress beats perfection. You can always improve a bad video. You can always improve bad audio. You can always make a video more interesting. You can always make a video more appealing. What you cannot improve is a video that does not exist. So, I always aim for- it may not be perfect the second time, but you will get better. Progress beats perfection. Just do it. Do it anyway.\

[00:18:10.480] - Liz\
Yes, I'm always like, if you're not embarrassed by something you create a year ago, you're not growing.\
\
[00:18:14.650] - Breonna\
Right.\
\
[00:18:15.730] - Liz\
Done is better than perfect. Get it out there and that's how you're going to learn. I love that. Okay, so I know- I take notes, but then they're really messy. Okay, so I know you do have something for attendees. You can tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:18:34.150] - Breonna\
Yes. So, I have a resource gap and it is ten different documents. You get a YouTube and you get a little blocking check list. You get pretty much everything to like a beauty on camera guy. You get a decorative background guy. So, it's over ten different checklists, resources, printables to help you start your YouTube channel and grow your YouTube channel.\
\
[00:18:56.800] - Liz\
I'm going to need to go get that as well. So, the link to that is below to the right, if I'm setting us up correctly, is definitely on this page, Breonna. I mean, I know this was a super long, but I feel like I already learned so much. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you want to add or last minute tips or...?\
\
[00:18:56.800] - Breonna\
I think I hope that the session was helpful and you don't feel free to DM me on Instagram. I actually like Instagram DMs. You can find me on Breonna Queen. I like Instagram, YouTube. I am a friendly content creator. And most people you hit up and you never hear back, that's not me. So, feel free to write me on Instagram, YouTube, I'm on Facebook as well, or Pinterest. I like Pinterest too. And just say, "Hey, I discovered you from the Bloggers thing." You can say, "Hi, how are you doing." So yeah. Just say hi guys.\
\
[00:19:49.860] - Liz\
Yes. Thank you so much. Don't hesitate to reach out to her. She's awesome. She- I was so thankful she agreed to do Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Breonna again, thank you and I hope you have a good rest of your day. We'll catch you at the next session.\
\
[00:20:02.070] - Breonna\
Yes. Bye.\

[00:00:12.050] - Caroline Vencil\
Hi, guys. Welcome to Super Simple Short Form Video. I'm here to teach you all about how to take your short-form video content and make it super profitable for you, for your business, so that you're not wasting your time. We're not chasing vanity metrics and you're actually making money from what basically is the hot form of content right now. So just kind of like as a heads up, we will be talking about both TikToks, Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Any kind of those short form, vertical -- vertical? Vertical videos that's what we're going to be talking about today. You will hear me use the words TikToks, Reels, and Shorts kind of interchangeably. So, don't just assume that it's just for the one platform. This is kind of things that goes across all of the different platforms as we're going. So I did not update these numbers today, but I wanted to show this to you. So before we kind of go anywhere, why am I talking about this? Hi, I'm Caroline. I have on TikTok at this point, I have more than 118,000 followers on TikTok. On Instagram right now, I have over 32,000, but in January of this year I had barely 9,000. And so it's grown very rapidly on Instagram this year, and the only thing that I did differently was that I started uploading my Reels consistently.\
\
[00:01:32.840] - Caroline\
I stopped relying just on the static posts and started uploading my Reels which are just recycled TikToks, which we will talk about, so don't worry. But for my growth strategies, for both of them, it's posting every single day as often as humanly possible -- as often as humanly possible. If you skip a day, it's not the end of the world, but this is kind of the growth strategy that they want to be seeing on both of these platforms and on YouTube. If you want to be doing short-form video, you have to commit to it consistently. Instagram is a little bit more difficult because I do Reels every single day which are just repurposed TikToks. I'll do a static post every other day, usually, and I'll post to my stories daily. So we'll talk more about kind of those strategies as we go. But before we get into that, hi, if we haven't met yet, I'm Caroline of carolinevencil.com and the Creative Entrepreneur Society. I have four beautiful children. My oldest is 13 and my youngest is four. It's never quiet in my house and someone's always hungry. I have been a content creator since 2015. I like to call myself an Internet dinosaur since I have been in the blogging space since 2015.\
\
[00:02:43.610] - Caroline\
I have seen a lot of different things come and go. But these are the strategies that we're going to be talking about that will help you stop trying to be like a flash in the pan and will help you get long-term success. On the back story of this is, it's more than just blogging for me. I do only work about 25 hours a week. Just to get and see that there's four children in my house. It's very busy. And in my spare time, I am a CrossFitter. My family and I play Mario Cart. My husband and I play Destiny 2, and I love making money while I sleep. So let's get into kind of like the nitty-gritty of what are the actual tools that you need in order to make this, this whole like short-form video thing for yourself. There's a lot of things that people have said over the years, and ultimately, I disagree with a lot of it, if we're being completely honest. And really what you need is your phone and a light source. And your light source can be anything like a ring light or, right now, what I'm using because my ring light decided to die on me right before I filmed this video, if we're being completely honest,\
\
[00:03:47.780] - Caroline\
I've opened up all of the windows in my room. Now, is it perfect because my laptop is in like the corner? No, it's not. But having some kind of a good light source does add to, I guess, like the crispness of the video and makes it easier for people to want to stick around and watch it. So ultimately, that's it. You have your phone. You have a window. Congratulations, you can make an awesome short-form video. You don't need anything crazy. You don't need to buy an expensive DSLR camera. You don't need anything like that. If you want to, you can get cut, cut -- CapCut. That's what it is CapCut. It's an app. It's free. You can record things there. You can edit things there. It's again free, but you don't need to get it. So that's kind of one of the biggest things that I think a lot of people freak out about is, what kind of things do I need. You really don't. You don't even need a tripod if you don't want to. You can get one. Like I said, this little picture here has a ring light that has a tripod holder in the middle. I hold my phone. I have a pop socket and I hold my phone.\
\
[00:04:49.840] - Caroline\
So there's the tools that you need. We're not making things complicated here at all. What if you don't want to show your face in the videos? We're going to talk about this in just a second. But what do you need? Cool beans -- you can use Canva and you can make slides on Canva. I have seen a lot of those in a short-form video. You can also use them as carousels in Instagram if you wanted. TikTok also has like a Slideshow thing that's similar to a carousel or you can just have them play. So, if you had kind of something that was a carousel, you just set the slides up to be three seconds long each and save it as a video, ta-da. If you don't want to do that and you have things that are more -- if you have planners or something that you want to show -- planners -- this is a notepad that you want to show off, you can always get a tripod that has the ability to point over top. So you would have your camera pointing down at the desk to show your hands. If you're cooking something, you can do it that way. A tripod is like 15 bucks. Or you can -- I have done this before\
\
[00:05:49.930] - Caroline\
I have quite literally like leaned my phone on things and that has worked as well. But as far as like tech that you need, if you don't want to show your face, this is it. It doesn't have to be difficult. It's -- I skipped one. I don't want to show my face in videos. Let's talk about this for a hot second because this is the thing. You can be successful without showing your face. However, if you have a personal brand, if you are the brand, for example, my business is carolinevencil.com I have -- I'm the face of my brand, so I have a personal brand. I want to show my face because it builds that name brand recognition, builds connections. People think that you're a real person, and that helps to facilitate building trust as well. I get it. If you don't want to show your face, that's a big hang-up that a lot of people have. But just in case you needed to hear it, you are beautiful. No, you don't have a weird accent. No, your voice doesn't sound weird. We judge ourselves so much more harshly than anybody else would ever judge us. So don't feel like you are too much or too blank or not enough of blank.\
\
[00:06:53.440] - Caroline\
You absolutely are. Put your face on camera. There's nothing wrong with it. But if you don't feel confident in doing that just yet, you can always go back to starting out without showing your face in your videos. But I do recommend that you do. Trends: this is another one of those hangups that a lot of people have when they're first starting with this kind of short form video. Do you have to do the trends? Do you have to learn all the TikTok dances and dance like the little children? No, you don't. No, you don't. You don't have to kind of try to figure out how to fit the square peg in the round hole of all of these trends and figure out how can you make that work for your branding if it doesn't make sense. You don't have to. All of my TikToks that I have ever created, well, not ever -- when I first started, I tried to do trends and it was just -- it made me want to pull my hair out. I'm not going to lie, and it didn't go anywhere. It was only once I actually started doing the method that I'm going to teach you guys for your video timelines that I actually grew my audience.\
\
[00:07:50.020] - Caroline\
And that was because it was difficult. I hated trying to figure out the trends. I'm not a dancing person. I don't like to wear makeup all of the time. You get to choose whether or not you want to do them. Is it a make or break thing that if you do a trend, you will go viral? No. Is it a make or break thing that if you don't do a trend, you will never have a successful short-form video? No. You do you, and you can make those kinds of decisions. And here's kind of the other thing is that with TikTok and Instagram, I guess, but I really only know TikTok about these with these filters. You can use filters. Do you have to? No, but if you are like, I don't want to put on makeup today, cool beans. There's a filter for that. I love doing that when I just don't feel like putting on makeup, but you don't need to use them. The cool ones are like the green screen ones where it allows you to your background. You can change your background to kind of you've seen people who have -- I should have had more props available.\
\
[00:08:50.610] - Caroline\
Hold, please. We're going to use my calculator as my example. So, for example, if you're talking about a product and you want it to appear behind you, a green screen filter will allow you to do that. You don't need to figure out how to use them. You can, but it's not mandatory. The next thing is music. So let's talk about music really quick. Do you need to have trending sounds in the backgrounds of your videos? I am on team no. And here's why because in 2022, YouTube especially crackdown on any kind of usage of copywritten materials inside of videos. So we're talking like if you have more than two seconds of a song in a background and it's copywritten, YouTube was striking it down and saying like we have to -- you can't use this, this sound in the background because it's copywritten by Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson, whoever, Taylor Swift. Like, um, that was so kind of one of the problems is that if you used it -- if you made a TikTok and it was really fantastic, and even if it went viral or something, if Beyonce said like I never want any of my music in the background of TikToks or in the background of YouTube shorts, it's copyright infringement shut it down. Anybody who used any of Beyonce's music in the background of their videos will have their videos muted.\
\
[00:10:10.020] - Caroline\
Like the audio will be muted. At least that's what it is on TikTok. I think that it's the same way on Instagram, but sometimes they'll just take down the video completely. So sometimes they'll mute it. Sometimes they'll take it down. It depends, and because of that, I stopped using music in the backgrounds of my videos because when it mutes the background or when it mutes the audio, all of that work that I did inside of that TikTok or that short-form video of whatever kind is gone. If I can't play it without it getting muted entirely, it's gone. So, I've stopped using music in the backgrounds of videos. That's just me. If you want to do trends, obviously music and kind of sounds are going to be important for those. But I don't think that they have sticking power in the same way that just teaching does. So, do you have to figure out music? No. Do you have to use music in the backgrounds? No. Is using music in the backgrounds or trending audio in the background of your short-form video of any kind going to make or break your video's ability to do well on a platform? No. So, now that we've gotten all of those kinds of hangups out of the way let's talk about your video timeline.\
\
[00:11:18.580] - Caroline\
We're going to talk about these videos in the concept of a 60-second video timeline. Okay? This is for all platforms. This is the kind of, I guess, modeology [SIC] -- methodology. This is what I use for all of my videos, and you'll see it. So, we're breaking it up into four different parts. Do you have to use all of these parts exactly? No, but I'm going to show you how to use them strategically so that you can actually make your money from your videos. The first part that we're going to talk about in your 60-second timeline is a hook. So, let's talk about your hook. These are the first one to three seconds. Our attention spans are teensy, teensy, tiny. Our attention spans are teensy, teensy, tiny. If you don't have a hook that sells me in those first three seconds, I'm out. Think about scrolling. I'm so sorry, I'm just getting over a cold. Think about scrolling on TikTok or Instagram. If you stay and watch something, is it making a decision in your head in the first one to three seconds? Yes. That's how long that it takes for you to decide if you're going to watch something. That's how short our attention spans are.\
\
[00:12:31.960] - Caroline\
That's how short our ability to hook somebody into watching the rest of our video is. So, this is kind of like the most crucial moment in our entire video is that first one to three seconds. Why do they care? Why should they care? Why should they stick around? This is the time to work on editing, which is where I brought up CapCut in the very beginning. You can also do it on the platform. So, what you want to do inside of your hook is if you are, this is the part that I edit, if you start your video and you're kind of I'm going to hold up my phone, and you pause for a second to make sure that the video is starting and then you go, hey, everybody you want to cut out that pause because that break is enough for me to keep scrolling. And it's enough for a lot of people to keep scrolling as well. You want that hook to be instantaneous. So here are some of the things that you can use to make your hook. I, in almost all of my videos, I start my videos by saying Canva hack because I know that people who are interested in Canva want to hear about it.\
\
[00:13:36.660] - Caroline\
I know that that is a first second -- split second that I can use to make and it works. If you struggle with blank, then you need to watch this video. X number of things I didn't know about the topic that we're going to talk about and how to become an expert. If you are a blank, if you are a mom, if you are a gardener, if you are a crazy cat lady like me, here are X number of tools that you need. I wish that I knew blankety-blank as a brand new crazy cat lady when I brought my crazy cat home, whatever it is. And brand new tool, feature, hack, app, something like that is sure fire kind of like way to see what it is that you can use to hook people's attention. And if you're still trying to figure out what works inside of your niche, go and watch other people's videos. Watch theirs and see what their hooks are that get you to stick around to watch the rest of their video. Okay. So we've talked about the hook, and next we're kind of going to talk about this topic intro. Your topic intro is going to be like 10 seconds long.\
\
[00:14:46.090] - Caroline\
We don't want to take too much time but this is going to be your hook expanded upon. This is where you're going to elaborate on why they should care about it because your hook is that first little sentence that you're using to get people to stick around to hear what it is that your video is about. You're going to tell them what your video is going to be about inside of your topic intro. This is the next kind of drop-off point in video watching. So, you want to keep this short, but you also want to keep it entertaining and explain what it is that they're going to learn. We're not going to belabor this one because quite frankly we're going to go on to explain it a little bit more in just a second. This is another super crucial part in your video timeline, is the talking about you. This is the one where I see a lot of people overlook this, and I don't want you to do that at all. And there's a strategy as to why it comes third and it comes before the longer part at the end. But here's where you're going to talk about you.\
\
[00:15:41.080] - Caroline\
This is your business. We're not just here to say like look at this cool thing that I -- I'm going to use another prop on my desk -- look at this cool thing that I bought. It's a baseball. And that's it. That's not a reason for people to stick around. It's not a reason for people to follow you. They don't know what it is that you have to offer. They don't know what other benefits that you can offer them. This is where you're going to talk about yourself. Talk about your business and what they can do to get more of you in their life. So, here's what I say in almost every single one of my videos or some variation of it. If we haven't met yet, hi, I'm Caroline. My business makes more than six figures every year helping online business owners learn how to create, market and promote their own products using Canva. Let me show you something cool that you can do inside of Canva. So, here I've already listed out my credentials. I talk about why I'm an expert, why they should listen to me, what it is that I offer, what it is that I teach inside of all of my stuff, and then what we're going to be talking about for the rest of the video.\
\
[00:16:37.580] - Caroline\
We'll talk more about like how other things can kind of contribute to making this super effective and a sticking point for people in just a second. But we can't get to the rest of it before we talk about the rest of the video which is your teaching so you're talking about you should be like five to 10 seconds. This is your elevator pitch. Keep this nice and short because again, quite frankly, people don't necessarily like care, care. That sounds mean, but at the end of the day think about it. I don't really care about you. I know that people don't care about me. They're here to think about what it is that they can learn. What it is that they can gain from watching this video. I like to introduce myself because that builds the know, like and trust relationship right off the bat. But at the end of the day, they're here for this last portion which is the teaching part. Your teaching should be the longest portion of your video. I like to say that it should be 30 seconds. You can kind of fudge up this timeline and it doesn't really matter. But I think that your teaching portion or your education portion or your entertaining portion should be the longest portion of it.\
\
[00:17:39.940] - Caroline\
If it's the three things that people need to know is show props. Use props. Use your backgrounds. Use your green screen filters. Remember to hold up your, you know -- if you're talking about a product, like use the images in the background behind you. This is the part where you can do that. Or if you're like me, I quite literally, because when I teach Canva creation, I will literally hold my -- I'm so old -- I'm going to tell you guys this and it's going to make me sound really, really like -- I hold my phone up and I record my computer screen like this. I'll, I'll move my phone around on my big desktop and I will record my computer screen. It doesn't have to be difficult. It doesn't have to be tricky. It doesn't have to even be anything crazy. You could, quite frankly, hold up your phone on your computer screen and show pictures of the images that you want if you want to. There's no real rules. You get to make this part up. But the biggest thing is you want to teach. You want to give that value and you want to help people and give them a reason to stick around and a reason to listen to what you have to say.\
\
[00:18:43.130] - Caroline\
So this is your general timeline. That's it. Your hook, your intro, talking about you and why they should care and why they should listen to you, and then giving them that value that you promised from the very beginning. That's it. Now here's where I like to think of, like this gets a little specific, but I wanted to be very, very open about this. I use text overlays to my advantage, and I use this to kind of circumvent a lot of -- what are they called? Like filters that things like if you -- you can't say the word free in certain videos, or you can't say link in bio because that comes up in auto text or auto caption and it will be bad for the algorithm, and then your reach will get suppressed. I don't make the rules. I'm just telling you what I have seen. So, I use my overlays, my text overlays for my calls to action. This is telling people where to go. I use this little screen grab here so that you can see in the aqua box, it says, Canva freebies in bio. That's what I have done. I use the upside-down, I know that there's an actual word for it, but it's an upside-down exclamation mark and a circle just like a bullet point circle.\
\
[00:19:59.210] - Caroline\
And so, that's what I use. And here is, oops, here are some other things that you can use. You could say, follow me for more blankety-blank content. Leave a comment of which tool, app, whatever it is that you're talking about, recipe that you like better. Save this video. Use these as your calls to action. Whatever it is that you want your people to do an action for, tell them. Give them something to do. So I told you we were going to come over with these overlays and I wanted to show you what I do. So remember how I said that the you part is kind of important but I don't necessarily like belabor that? I don't. I do have a place a text overlay that will say, follow for more the entire time that I'm talking about me. And then at the end, I will have a text overlay that will say that will encourage people to go over to my bio to sign up for my email newsletter, to grab freebies, to sign up for a webinar, whatever it is. I will use that last portion of the video, at that point in time, to have a text that says, link in bio or freebies in bio or Canva training in bio, whatever it is, that's what I will do.\
\
[00:21:09.260] - Caroline\
And here's the why. Okay. Follow for more. I put the follow for more under the you because, quite frankly, I think that following is really important. But here's the cool thing is that following does not have them navigating away from the video. You want people to stay on your video for as long as possible for the algorithm. Again, I don't make the rules. I'm just going to give you feedback from what I have seen. You want people to stay for as long as they possibly can on your video. You don't want people to navigate away from your video by giving them a call to action to go to your bio when they're only 15 seconds into the video. You want them to stay on your video watching as long as possible and follow for more. They can follow or subscribe or whatever it is from that video screen. On TikTok, it's a little plus button. On Instagram, it's a little follow button. Whatever it is, they are still watching the video and they're taking that action from that video. They're not leaving. They're not going anywhere because if they have to go somewhere, they might never come back and finish the video.\
\
[00:22:12.110] - Caroline\
We want to give them some kind of a way to stay on the video, interact, give them that call to action there. At the end, that's where the link in bio is because if they have watched through the end of the video, the chances are really high that they are your people. That they are there for you. That they're like, oh, my gosh, this is it. This is what I have been looking for. If they like this piece of content of yours, they're probably going to like your other pieces of content too. That's when it's safe to say, go check out my link in bio. It's okay to navigate away from the video at the end. Because again, if they like the video, if they've stuck around for that long, the chances are really good that they're likely going to take some kind of an action on your profile as well. So I hope that that part made a lot of sense, but that's what I like to do as far as this stuff goes. So here comes the next part. Can you repurpose these videos? Yes. Yes, absolutely, you can. This is something that you should absolutely do. It doesn't matter if it was just made for a TikTok, you can use it on Reels, you can use it on Shorts.\
\
[00:23:17.570] - Caroline\
Take that one piece of content and stretch it across all of your different platforms. Repurpose it. Use it constantly. And then if you've used it and it's been a few months, do it again. Save it again. Don't have anything that you want to share for today? Can -- feel sick? Your kids are sick? It's just kind of a blah day. You lose your voice for two weeks. What are you going to do? Repurpose. Take stuff that you've already used, repurpose it, post it again. It doesn't have to be difficult. This is the website that I use. It's called Snaptik, and it's snaptik.app is what it is. I think that there's an actual app for it, but I just use the website. If you just google Snaptik, it'll be there. You, quite frankly, take the URL for your TikTok and just post it there and you can download your video. It gets rid of the watermark. You don't want to save your video and have the watermark because Instagram, especially, has already said that it's going to throttle your reach if you do have that. So we want to avoid that, obviously. So you can download your videos without the watermark.\
\
[00:24:24.360] - Caroline\
It's really simple to do so. And then you can repurpose it across all of your different content platforms. So, another few tips before we end, use captions. Almost, I think, every single one of the different platforms right now has auto-generated captions that you can use. Make sure that you edit them. Make sure that you edit them. Just read through them. Just watch the whole thing one time and make sure that the captions actually get what you're saying because sometimes it picks up things and you're like that is not even kind of close to what I said. So, double check on that before you just blindly post them but use captions. It helps because a lot of people don't watch videos with sound which I get like you don't want people to know when you're pulling up TikTok or pulling up Reels. So, having those auto-generated captions really is helpful for people. As far as using hashtags, use your hashtags. I use hashtags. Every single one of my videos on TikTok has hashtags. You want to be specific, though, with them? I really love it in TikTok especially you can see the numbers. Like you can see the popularity of the hashtags and you can see suggested ones.\
\
[00:25:38.340] - Caroline\
So, if I'm talking about Canva, I will do #canva and I will see what other things come up underneath of it as far as trending hashtags or hashtags that have a lot of reach, a lot of videos or that are relevant. And that's how I do my hashtagging. I would recommend avoiding using hashtags that are super generalized. So, you don't want to do something like #fyp which is for your page, or #reels, #tiktok, #popular, #mustsee or whatever it is. You don't want to necessarily just do these super broad ones just to try to get onto people's pages. You want to use ones that are specific because, at the end of the day, we have to remember that this isn't just something that we're just throwing out there. We're not here for the vanity metrics. We're here for the actual growth. We're here for actually getting people onto our email list. That's why all of this matters. It's not just getting those big numbers because at the end of the day, if you don't have a website or a place for people to sign up for your email list, TikTok could go away. Instagram could go away.\
\
[00:26:47.070] - Caroline\
YouTube could go away. We don't have control over what those platforms do. But what we do have control over is making sure that we can get our audience onto our email list. We can show our audience all the other things that we have to offer, and that's what I think is most important. And I hope that that makes sense to you today. So, biggest thing for you to remember is to just start. I know that videos can be overwhelming and for a lot of people they really are. If you need some extra support, tag me in your video. Just tag me in the comments or whatever you want to do. I will cheer for you. I will show up in your comment section, and I will cheer for you because I know that this is scary. This is a big, scary thing putting yourself out there. Just start. Just start. And if you need more, I do have Instagram story templates. If you go to carolinevencil.com/ig, I have Instagram story templates that you can use from Canva to make your Instagram stories an easier place for people to sign up for your freebies, for your offers, whatever it is because now everybody has the swipe up feature or the link feature on their stories which I adore.\
\
[00:27:55.270] - Caroline\
So I hope that that helped. Thank you guys so much for being here. Thank you for putting up with the fact that my voice sounds kind of like a frog, and I will talk to you guys soon. Bye.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.370] - Cat\
Hi there. I'm Cat and welcome. I'm here today to talk to you about Instagram. And I'm going to talk very quickly because I've got a lot to share with you today. Just quickly about my background with Instagram, I accidentally signed to Instagram because I wanted to build a travel account and I grew that account to 100,000 followers within about two years. Part of building that account, I became very obsessed with everything Instagram. And I'm also a University teacher.\
\
[00:00:47.980] - Cat\
So, I've combined the obsession with Instagram, passion for teaching. Now I offer a range of courses and resources for people who are looking to grow Instagram either for their blogs or their businesses. I live in South Korea, so I'm having great fun taking advantage of the Squid Games phenomenon that's going on around right now. And also this has no relevance to anything, but I am absolutely obsessed with Peaky Blinders. Okay, let's go get into the good stuff.\
\
[00:01:21.090] - Cat\
What are we going to cover? Well, I've gone with the title for today's presentation and Instagram - a social support for your blog, which is what it can be. It can be a great source of directing traffic to your blog, but also part of building up your brand, building up who you are around your blog. And we're going to look at some ways that you can use Instagram successfully alongside your blog today.\
\
[00:01:51.810] - Cat\
So, there's a focus on three different things. And first of all, optimizing your bio, so this will allow you to skyrocket your discoverability.\
\
[00:02:05.730] - Cat\
I'll explain why. It will help you to attract your ideal followers, and it will help you drive traffic to your blog if done effectively. Next, we're going to look at how to hashtag effectively. So, this again will increase your discoverability. The more people discover you.\
\
[00:02:27.310] - Cat\
The more people who can follow you, fall in love with your content and the more people that will head over to your blog as well. It allows Instagram to understand your niche. The more data we can give Instagram about who we are, what we do, the better Instagram is directing the right people to our Instagram account, and also they increase your engagement.\
\
[00:02:56.490] - Cat\
I'm very against like focusing on vanishing metrics. But engagement, it's nice to have people like your photos, comment on your photos, but increased engagement is a snowball effect of more engagement on your content. More people will see your content. If they engage, more people will see, more people will see, and so on. So, we're not focusing on the fantasy side of it.\
\
[00:03:22.600] - Cat\
We're focusing on the practical. How can extra engagement actually help get our content in front of people?\
\
[00:03:33.250] - Cat\
Okay. And number three, then I'm going to talk about the different neighborhoods and the different features on Instagram and what different content types suit for different purposes. Right. I've only got 30 minutes, so I need to go straight in with this. So, here we go.\
\
[00:03:52.570] - Cat\
First of all, we're talking about how to optimize your bio. Now, everyone gets very obsessed with finding the perfect handle for Instagram. By handle, I mean the @ blah blah blah. That's great and all. But your name, your bold section is just as important.\
\
[00:04:14.170] - Cat\
And the reason why is, this is the only part of all of your bio which appears under searches. If you're using hashtags, whatever other words you have in your bio, doesn't matter. You're not going to show up under any searches from that. The only part which will show up under searches is the name, the bold section, basically the path directly underneath your photo. So, in here you want to think about what keywords you want to use that your target audience will be searching for on Instagram.\
\
[00:04:53.170] - Cat\
I was travel blog. I'm from the UK, I'm female. I had a UK female travel blogger as my, so had @, so I had my first name and then UK female travel blogger. From me making that change in here. The amount of DMs, emails I got asking for collaborations skyrocketed. Because if you put in female travel blogger or UK travel blogger, only around 20 or 30 came up.\
\
[00:05:27.130] - Cat\
I was one of that 20 or 30. It was really easy for any companies, any brands to find. So, if your goal is to work, if you're looking for sponsorships, you're looking for brand deals and you're looking to promote work, collaborate with companies. Think about what they might be searching for and that's something you can include or the people who you want to be reading your blog, what will they be looking for? And be as specific as you can, but think about it in terms of what would they type into Google?\
\
[00:06:04.440] - Cat\
And you need to try and fit that in here. Now before you run ahead and go and start changing things, just pause a moment. So, you can edit this, but you can only edit it once every two weeks, so play around with it. See what will fit within your character limit, see how it looks visually. Don't hit save until you're completely happy with it, or else you get stuck with like half a sentence for two weeks until you can change it again.\
\
[00:06:36.830] - Cat\
Now there's lots of us here. Why don't you share your bold name in comments? Have a nosey what everyone else is doing. I will have a look. I'll give you some feedback.\
\
[00:06:47.670] - Cat\
Any changes that you might want to make on there. Any suggestions or if you really don't know what your bold name, your name name should be in there. Poking in comments. Let me have a look. I'll try and help you come up with something that fits your niche. And yeah, do have a nosy.\
\
[00:07:06.440] - Cat\
See what everyone else is doing. That's what I love about being in comments of like Summit's presentations, like this is, you can meet people by chatting away in the comments. So, Share your bold name. Share what you do in the comments. See what everyone else is up to and get some sneaky inspiration.\
\
[00:07:25.130] - Cat\
Okay. So, we've got the bold name and then we've got the main part of the bio. Short and sweet is the lesson here. Don't go on, I mean you can't fit more on page. You don't have enough characters, but don't just throw everything in there for the sake of it. People literally glance at your bio.\
\
[00:07:47.940] - Cat\
So, if they can glance at your bio and quickly see who you are and what you do, that's going to attract their attention. If they're faced with a wall of text and like, oh yeah, I'm bored of this and then move on to the next account because the odds are you are not the only account offering content of that style. You know there's a billion users on Instagram. There's a lot of competition out there. So, you want to have your main part of your bio very clear about what you are, what you do, who you are.\
\
[00:08:27.590] - Cat\
Use emojis, but use emojis to draw the eye.\
\
[00:08:32.210] - Cat\
Don't use emojis in place of vocabulary. So, for example, if your blog is about books and you write, I love and a book emoji and with a cup of coffee. That actually makes it harder for people to quickly read and take the information from your bio. Because they're looking at text image, text image. I'm sure this will change in ten years, but right now our brains are not quite geared up to quickly doing that mind shift. So, use emojis, but use them to, maybe like bullet point style, key information, but not in replacement of words in there.\
\
[00:09:19.550] - Cat\
And then the last one is don't use any hashtags in your bio unless it's a very very personal branded hashtag that nobody else is going to be using. Don't use any hashtags. The reason is a hashtag in your bio is clickable. They can click on that hashtag and that will take them away to other people's content. Then they're probably going to see something else that interests them and you've lost them.\
\
[00:09:50.510] - Cat\
And even if they want to come back to you, they might not remember who you are. They not remember how they got in your profile in the first place. So, don't give them the opportunity to click and leave your profile. Okay. And if you are wanting to use Instagram to direct people to your blog, then you can have a web link on your bio. Hey, it's actually changing.\
\
[00:10:16.640] - Cat\
It's going to be two web links, but at the moment it is just one. You need a strong call to action. People are on Instagram because they want to be on Instagram. They're having a great time on Instagram, scrolling through polls, engaging with people, and you know watching videos chatting away. If you want them to leave that space that they're having a great time in, you need to give them a really good reason to do this.\
\
[00:10:45.950] - Cat\
So, you need a very strong call to action. What are you offering them? What amazing thing are they going to find if they click that link. And again, it should be very clear, concise, this is what you're going to get if you click my link when they click that link.\
\
[00:11:06.270] - Cat\
So, try not to have it just going to your blog.\
\
[00:11:12.270] - Cat\
You're directing them to something specific, so they know what they're going to get. Make sure that that link goes to that page. Or if you're using something like link tree. And again, don't use link tree if you've got a blog. Create your own page on your blog that's like link tree.\
\
[00:11:29.710] - Cat\
Have all your links on there. You're getting the traffic going from Instagram. If you ever need to run ads later, that's extra data that you've got from there. So, do try and keep this on your own web page. But what your call to action on Instagram here?\
\
[00:11:45.950] - Cat\
That needs to be the top link. If people click on it and they have to start looking for something, again, they're either going to get distracted and forget why they're on there. Or they're going to get bored, or they're going to go down a rabbit hole of searching something else, so make it very very easy call to action. The first link they see, the first thing that they see is relevant to what that call to action is.\
\
[00:12:16.650] - Cat\
Okay. So, we're going to move on to hashtags. Now first of all, I'm curious currently, how many hashtags do you use right now? And I'm asking because there's so many schools of thought on this, everyone does different. So, let me know what you use. And I'm going to have a little bit of a nosy at those comments and see what you're doing.\
\
[00:12:43.510] - Cat\
But I'll answer the question for you of how many hashtags should you use and you're going to love this answer. It depends. Okay. The reason it depends is everyone's account is different. Everyone's content is different.\
\
[00:13:00.380] - Cat\
Even if you're in the same niche as someone else. Your content is different. So, the way hashtags work is, they reflect what the content is. They reflect whether people are engaging with those hashtags. And then from there, your content gets shown under those hashtags.\
\
[00:13:20.710] - Cat\
Now, for some people's accounts, using all 30 hashtags gets some great visibility and it works really well with their content. Other people's accounts around ten hashtags works brilliantly for their content. You might have seen, so I'm recording this in November. You might have seen that.\
\
[00:13:44.990] - Cat\
There's a big thing being said quite recently that you should only use three or four hashtags. Now, the context for that is that was the Instagram Creators account. And the people that are putting content on there are creators, but they're the creators have hundreds of thousands of followers, millions of followers already established brands already very visible. And they're probably not needing that reach from the hashtags. They are probably, even if they're using only four hashtags, they're probably getting into top posts under those four hashtags. They don't need to like widen the net.\
\
[00:14:27.630] - Cat\
So, to speak.\
\
[00:14:29.110] - Cat\
So, you can't say that what an account with a million followers, very engaged followers and what they do should be the same for your account if you've got 500 followers, for example. So, every account is different. So you do need to experiment with how many hashtags you use. One thing that we can actually really do with our hashtags, though, is apply the Goldilocks principle.\
\
[00:14:56.060] - Cat\
So, if you might remember how Goldilocks, she didn't want anything too big or too small. And that's kind of a blanket rule we can add with hashtags. Now every account is different. This isn't going to be exactly the same for every account. But as a general rule, you don't want to be using huge hashtags. And by huge, I mean that they've been used like millions of times, and you don't want to be using tiny hashtags either.\
\
[00:15:23.780] - Cat\
And by tiny I mean like two or 3000 times. If you look at the image just above my head here. I've got Travel Cambodia and you can see that's been used 96.1 thousand times. That's what I mean by the size, how many times the hashtag has been used. The reason that we don't want to use huge hashtags is because when we make a post on the hashtag providing the hashtag is still active, then there's hundreds of other people making a post at the same time. And your post will just drop off the end of the hashtag feed.\
\
[00:16:04.570] - Cat\
You can test it out.\
\
[00:16:06.030] - Cat\
Use travel. Look at what is at the top of the feed. Give it 5 seconds, refresh your phone and that hashtag will have gone down. It will have vanished. So, you don't want to be using hashtags that are too big and hashtags which are too small.\
\
[00:16:23.850] - Cat\
You might struggle to get any attraction on because it might mean that nobody is viewing those hashtags unless you are in a very specific, very tight niche. And you know that like all your target audience are using engaging on those hashtags. Then avoid using too small ones. As a general rule, you want to be using hashtags between about 50,000 and 200,000 for most of your hashtags. Some going up to 500,000 maybe and any between 500,000, a million, one or two at the absolute most. But keep most of your hashtags between about 200 and 500 thousand.\
\
[00:17:08.530] - Cat\
Also do make sure that the hashtags that you're using, you don't use the same hashtag on all of your post, back to back. You do mix them up. You make sure that you're using hashtags which are relevant to that specific post, that specific content. And also that your hashtags.\
\
[00:17:30.590] - Cat\
They're not just on the industry hashtags, but they're actually hashtags that your target audience will be looking for and searching and wanting to use themselves.\
\
[00:17:43.250] - Cat\
So, one last thing that I want you to be really careful about is that you're not using banned hashtags. Now, if you use a banned hashtag, you will get zero reach and the hashtags on that post. It can also affect your trust rating with Instagram, you might struggle to get reach in the future, too. So, a banned hashtag, it's usually quite often an innocent hashtag, but for some reason it's been used for people for nefarious reasons.\
\
[00:18:16.850] - Cat\
Inappropriate content. Occasionally, the hashtags can get hijacked in certain situations like join terrorist attacks and things like that. So, banned hashtags can change all the time. Easter was banned one year, and that has been okay over years. So, banned hashtags constantly change.\
\
[00:18:40.730] - Cat\
Keep an eye on your insights. So, assuming that you have a business or a creative account, which you absolutely should have, so you can get access to all your insights. Look in your insights under posts. See how many views you get under hashtags. If you are not getting any views under your hashtags, it's possible that you've used a banned hashtag. You might just be using an effective hashtags, but maybe you've used a banned hashtag.\
\
[00:19:12.770] - Cat\
Okay, so what is a banned hashtag? Got two examples here. If you look at logo design and you can see, so from this search, logo design just hasn't come up in the search. You can't even attempt to try and use the hashtag logo design. Kind of hidden behind my head.\
\
[00:19:35.610] - Cat\
But also if you look at beauty blogger that comes up with a warning that posts are being hidden under that hashtag because of content that's been shared under it. So that's how you can tell if a hashtag has been banned or not. You can Google and various lists will come up with banned hashtags. But as I say, it's a constantly changing list. This list changes all the time.\
\
[00:20:05.710] - Cat\
Here are some hashtags that as of me making this presentation are currently banned. They always make me sad for any Harry Potter fans out there. You will understand why, but yeah, some of them are quite surprising to people. Did any of these surprise you? Let me know in the comments.\
\
[00:20:29.730] - Cat\
Which one surprised you the most? I'll just quickly have a look there. Yeah. Okay. To me.\
\
[00:20:39.440] - Cat\
Desk. I find desk the most surprising.\
\
[00:20:44.390] - Cat\
Alright. So, what we're going to look at now is we're going to look at the different neighborhoods of Instagram. So, what do I mean by this? I mean, the different content types on Instagram, what they are? When you should be using them? Why you should be using them?\
\
[00:21:02.810] - Cat\
So, you've got the original. You've got feed post. And feed post is the square on your feed. And it can be an image. It can be a video. It can be a carousel.\
\
[00:21:16.670] - Cat\
These are still great folder to have. These are still brilliant for reaching people. And the different types of people do have different functions. For example, carousels typically don't do very well under hashtags. But they do really well under engagement, partly because with the carousel, you're able to deliver quite a lot of information in a very digestible way. People will scroll through them people are staying on that profile longer.\
\
[00:21:51.950] - Cat\
All of these things help your reach and people are more likely to engage on them. But also with a carousel post, you get two shots at being seen. So, what Instagram will do is it will show that first screen of the carousel and then it will show the second screen of the carousel later on. So, you get two for the price of one. If you're making a Carousel post. You can also share short form videos in your feed.\
\
[00:22:26.510] - Cat\
You may or may not be able to share your IGTV video to your feed. At the moment, IGTV is being transitioned to a new tab along with Reels. So, some people have this new tab, some people don't. But if you don't have it now, it's coming soon, so I'll talk about that separately.\
\
[00:22:50.930] - Cat\
So, for now, we're thinking of single image post, video posts or carousel posts. Now you might have seen the big rumor going around that Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app. I just want to quickly challenge this up, address this, sorry. So, Adam Mosseri said this, the head of Instagram, in one of his live videos. Now that guy, trust me, the amount of times you say something in a live video and then comes back and corrects it later is unbelievable.\
\
[00:23:25.210] - Cat\
He really should think before he speaks because he causes all this drama. But yeah, he said in a live video that Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app. He meant Instagram is no longer just a photo sharing app. He has since been back on Instagram, on Twitter, in his lives, even in his feed, saying that photos still images will always have a place on Instagram as far as he can foresee. And if you look at his own feed as well, he's sharing photos half a time too, so he's still on board for that.\
\
[00:24:01.750] - Cat\
So, don't worry. If you're not all about the video, you are all about the still images or the beautiful graphic creations. They still very much have a home on Instagram today.\
\
[00:24:16.310] - Cat\
Now reels are the new cool kid on the block. And Reels can be brilliant for getting reach. The downside with this is that it doesn't necessarily reach your target audience. Now the targeting on reels is becoming more focused. They now appear under hashtags under their own tab. We are starting to get more analytics for reels, so we are starting to be able to use reels more strategically to reach a target audience.\
\
[00:24:48.590] - Cat\
But it still comes down to factors of what music is played in the reel, whether the reel is entertaining rather than whether you've got keywords in there, whether you're using hashtags in there. So, if you are creating reels and you enjoy creating reels, fantastic. They have a huge possibility for reach. Make sure within those reels, though, that the content you are creating is to reach your target audience. You're not just creating them for the sake of going viral. Because if you end up going viral with the wrong audiences, you might get a lot of followers.\
\
[00:25:26.990] - Cat\
But if they're not your target audience, they're not going to relate to your content.\
\
[00:25:31.780] - Cat\
They're not going to be interested in your blog and then that actually ends up harming your account because you have people following your account that aren't interested in your content. So, make sure if you're using reels that the content in those reels is aligned with who you are, what your content is about and what your target audience will respond to. And then when you do go viral with a reel, you're reaching the right audience.\
\
[00:26:00.870] - Cat\
So, stories are absolutely something else that you want to be doing on Instagram. Now. They don't reach new people. You don't ever get new followers from stories unless someone happens to have shared one of your stories and someone tracks you down from there. But as a general rule, your stories are for your current audience.\
\
[00:26:23.190] - Cat\
But your stories a way you get to show up several times a day and you really get to be you. Your audience can really get to know who you are from stories. So, you do want to be using stories if you're comfortable and try and push yourself if you're not. You want to be on camera.\
\
[00:26:41.390] - Cat\
You want to be visible even images, videos. Let people get to know the real you in stories. And try and post several times a day, and you want to spread them out throughout the day. So, for example, every time you post a new story, it puts you to the front of the queue. So, you want to be creating new story, new story, new story, morning, lunch, evening, or you know in the morning spread them out. So, each time you go back to the front of the queue and you want really personable relatable content in your stories.\
\
[00:27:19.950] - Cat\
Live videos can also be great. For one reason, a live video, it will send a notification to all your followers who are online at that point that you've gone live. And people are quite often nosy. There's a very good chance that people are going to come and want to check out what you are doing. Have a little bit of a nosy. Check out that live.\
\
[00:27:43.610] - Cat\
So, live videos are great, really brilliant way as well for allowing your audience to get to know you. And what you can do with the live video is you can then share that as an IGTV video. You can make sure you've got in your settings, auto captions are generated and then you've got a captioned video that you can put straight onto your either main feed or your video feed depending on where you are with your account right now. And again, they can be a great way of giving a big value, really showing expertise to your audience.\
\
[00:28:21.870] - Cat\
So, I hope you found this useful. And what I want you to take away from this is can you optimize your bio.\
\
[00:28:31.410] - Cat\
Make sure your bio is discoverable. Make sure people are going to want to follow you from your bio and take that call to action. Build yourself a hashtag bank 50 to 200 thousand. Focus on those hashtags. Make sure you're not using any banned hashtags and then create a content plan around your needs.\
\
[00:28:53.680] - Cat\

Cat Griffin [00:00:12]:\
Hello, and welcome to my presentation. So just very very quickly, in case you don't know who I am, my name is Cat Griffin, and I became an accidental obsessor of Instagram around 8 years ago when I decided to make a bet with my husband that I would become a travel influencer. He found this hilarious and justifiably so, seeing as I hadn't even looked at Instagram at this point. So to say I was clueless is the understatement of the probably the decade, maybe century. But I did. I grew that travel account to a 100,000 followers and a bit more, and then I quickly became bored. Now my day job is I am a teacher. I teach at a university in South Korea.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:01:01]:\
So the natural next step for me was to help others teach others how to effectively use social media to grow their own businesses, their presence online, their blogs, and how to leverage it effectively. Now in today's presentation, I'm talking about Instagram, what's hot and what's not in 2025. The intention of this presentation is you want to use Instagram to grow your presence. You want to have a presence on Instagram, but you don't want you know, you don't have hours and hours to spend on it every day. It's a realistic look at how to use Instagram to grow your presence online. It's not a this is going to be your be all and end all. I just want to make that clear from the start, my goal is not to overwhelm you with how to use Instagram. So the first thing I want to say is remember your audience.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:02:02]:\
So regardless of anything I say throughout this presentation, it's your audience that want to\
\
Cat Griffin [00:02:07]:\
be at the heart of any practices, any decisions, any strategy that you use on Instagram. So I'm going\
\
Cat Griffin [00:02:16]:\
to say the dreaded algorithm word, but what actually drives the algorithm is your audience and what your audience want from you, what they enjoy from you. If you are making content that your audience enjoy and consume and find valuable, it doesn't matter if that content is a static image post. It doesn't matter if that is a highly edited reel. It doesn't matter if it's a beautiful carousel. If you are creating content that your audience enjoy, are consuming, are engaging with, then the algorithm will show that content to your audience, and it will show it to lookalike audiences too. This is where I put on my teacher hat and become a little bit stern. It's really important because of this then that you don't engage in any kind of fake following, fake engagement. Even things like dropping your Instagram handle in follow for follow threads can be harmful for you in the algorithm because it creates a fake audience for Instagram to follow.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:03:29]:\
So not does it just mean that your content will be shown to the wrong audience, people aren't your target audience, It will also end up limiting your reach on Instagram because people aren't engaging your content because it's being shown to the wrong audience. They don't like it, but Instagram doesn't know it's a wrong audience because it's using the data that you have given it. So everything that you do on the platform, you want to be organic. You want to be genuine. But at the heart of it is you want it to be content for your audience. And also remember who you are. Your audience want to get to know you through the platform. If people are checking you out on socials, it's because they're expecting to see the human side, the personal side, the know the person behind the business, behind the brand.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:04:23]:\
And I'm not saying that you need to share all your private personal information. You don't. You can still, share as much or as little of that as you want. But you do need to have your personality, your values, your your visions, your your aspirations, all of those kind of things your audience are going to want to see from you on the platform. Now following on from that, then I do want to just introduce you to the concept of the evergreen, first of all.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:04:56]:\
So the evergreen feed. So the evergreen feed is if you\
\
Cat Griffin [00:05:03]:\
know that you don't want to be active on Instagram, but you know that your audience are going to look for you on Instagram. So about 80% of people actually do go and look for a business on Instagram before they make a purchase. Now you might not have the time to be on Instagram. It might not be the platform that you really want to be active on. An evergreen feed is a perfect solution to this. It's basically a static 9 grid or 12 grid feed that very quickly allows people to find out about you and your business, your blog. Not quite at a glance, but very quickly visually, and all the important information is there for them to very easily find. Some people do use an evergreen feed if they're creating reels as well.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:05:55]:\
I teach not to do that. I teach if you are going to create reels, then you should have those reels on your feed. You shouldn't hide those behind an evergreen feed. Because if you're creating reels that people like, then they're going to follow you for that. People are genuinely not going to follow you because of an evergreen feed, but it is a source of information. It's a place where people can find out about your business quite easily. So just to recap that, an evergreen feed is great if you know your audience are going to look for you on Instagram, but you don't want to spend time creating content. It does come into caveat though you are going to grow a following on Instagram or not a significant following on Instagram to an evergreen feed because you're not creating new content that's going to be being pushed out to new people for people to find you.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:06:55]:\
Now I do want to just sort of go back to your audience, and we always talk about you need to be on the platform where your audience are active. Your audience might be active on the platform but your content your content type might not be what they want on Instagram. So for example, I need an accountant. I will look on Instagram to check out about an accountant that\
\
Cat Griffin [00:07:24]:\
I'm interested in, but I'm never going to follow an account on Instagram because I\
\
Cat Griffin [00:07:29]:\
have no desire to see that content showing on my feed. If that is what you do not I mean, maybe you are an accountant. But if what you do is something that isn't content that people are necessarily going to want to keep following, be engaged with on the on Instagram, again, the evergreen feed is a perfect solution.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:07:52]:\
Not only are you not wasting your time creating content, but you've got\
\
Cat Griffin [00:07:56]:\
a very solid place that when people do go and look to find out about you, it is all there. So you've got the presence without doing all the work.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:08:08]:\
Alright. So moving on, I mentioned reels already. Let's talk about reels. So reels aren't going anywhere. Now you might love creating reels, and that's fantastic. You might hate creating reels and that's also okay. What I do\
\
Cat Griffin [00:08:28]:\
want to share is if you are creating reels, again remember who your audience are. Don't just necessarily chase going viral with a reel. You want to make sure that your reel is delivering value, is speaking directly to your target audience. It's not about the number of views on a reel. It's about whether or not those views are reaching the right people. And if you are very very niche, then it is a very niche audience that you want to reach. Maybe you do have a very broad audience, in which case, then, yes, going bright going viral will be an effective strategy for you. But the ability to actually go viral, a lot of that comes down to luck.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:09:21]:\
It's not something yes. You can strategize. Yes. You can have engaging content. Yes. You can have content that's interesting and has transitions and has great music, and all of these things help. But there is also an element of luck factor there too. So without spending all your time worrying about everything being perfect, spend your time worrying about, is this content that will value will give value to my audience, my audience will want to see.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:09:55]:\
Now there are a lot of low effort reels. So if you're like, yes. My audience do like reels. I don't love being on camera, or I don't have the time to shoot a lot of reels,\
\
Cat Griffin [00:10:08]:\
I don't have the space in my home, any of these things. There are a lot of low effort reels that you can create. So you\
\
Cat Griffin [00:10:16]:\
can use b roll content, and you can either create your own, or if\
\
Cat Griffin [00:10:20]:\
you're using something like Canva or maybe you've got a stock, a video content subscription. And b roll content is things like when you\
\
Cat Griffin [00:10:31]:\
see a coffee cup being stirred, or you see panning across the ocean, or leaves being kicked up as somebody's walking. That kind of content, which you can then overlay with text information. And you can reuse this b roll content multiple times. You can be shooting this yourself. You know, if you're going out in the autumn, fall leaves, you could make pick up some leaves yourself. If you're at a beautiful location, you can shoot a quick panning video, or there is tons of videos available on places like Canva that you can use and quickly put text as an overlay on there. You can just simply talk to the camera. You don't need to worry about all the fancy transitions and quick costume changes and all that.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:11:27]:\
If you've got something you know your audience want to hear, just talk to them about it directly through the camera. Don't worry about all the fancy editing and everything if you don't want to. You can also use things like writing on post it notes or taking post it notes away. You can even just film writing or typing or screen records. These are all low effort ways that you can use video to communicate with your audience, and you can even actually use a carousel and make that into a reel. So if you've got a carousel post and you add music to that fur first post on the carousel, that automatically means that it will show in the reels tab. I am going to say though that just because something shows as a reel or something is a reel, it doesn't mean that people are going to enjoy it as a reel, but they're going to consume that content in the way that they create other reels. So, again, you're focusing on content that your audience will enjoy, not just creating a reel because it's for the sake of creating a reel.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:12:41]:\
One thing to do though, and this has become increasingly important, is use a cover for your reel. This is something that's been sort of transitioned across and different players currently show differently, but it's becoming more and more that reels don't automatically play from home screens or in the search screens. So you need a cover for that reel so that people can quickly see, what the reel is. If it's just like a, you know, the first sort of screen grab of a reel, it's not going to tell them anything about the reel. So you need to use a cover much like you would have, like, a static post on Instagram and add that to your reel. And you can do that when you're sharing the reel on Instagram. You can simply select cover and upload your own image, or select a screen grab, so maybe a later screen from within the reel. You can use that to be your cover.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:13:43]:\
You can even create reel covers within stories. So use, like, the text and images, options, stickers in stories to create a reel cover too. But it is important that you have a cover for your reel that people can quickly easily see what that reel is going to be about from. Captions are still really important. You still need to have a hook and a call to action. If you are creating reels, you need these in the content of your reel and within text. And your call to action shouldn't just be read the caption. It should be something active within what you're saying within the reel too.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:14:30]:\
For example, if you want people to go and check out a link, tell them to check out the link. If you want people to go and read your latest blog post on something, tell people to go and read your latest blog post. Hashtags were huge on Instagram. They are becoming less so, but they aren't redundant. You will still get a few views from hashtags. They're not the way that you go right viral anymore, but they are useful in terms of helping Instagram categorize what your content is about. So make sure hashtags that you are using are very specific to that post that you've created, and you only need to use a handful of hashtags. The days of using 30 hashtags are long behind us.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:15:25]:\
But what you do need to use is keywords. So Instagram more and more uses technology to determine what your content is about based on the image and based on your captions. So throughout your caption, you need to be dropping keywords. For example, if you are a a cake baker and you make, custom birthday cakes, those words need to be in your caption, and anything else that might be what people are searching for. For example, if you bake for a local area, then that will be included in your caption. Doesn't have to be every single one, but you do need to have that regularly popping up so that Instagram understands what your content is about and who to show your content to. We also want to be using alt text, alternative text on our images.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:16:28]:\
Partly for the reasons that I've just said, but Instagram\
\
Cat Griffin [00:16:33]:\
knows what the image of is of because it can see what the image is of, but it doesn't necessarily know the intent behind the image, which you can also add into the alt text. You can also tell it who the image is of. So if the image is of you, put your name in there. This is a photo of Cat Griffin, a woman who is blah blah blah, describing the image there. She's very happy. She looks happy because give the context of a situation that maybe the AI reader won't pick up on. Okay. They don't know every industry.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:17:11]:\
They don't know every business. They don't know that that perfect, fondue that you've just created in your hand is why you are extremely excited. But if you're putting your own alt text in there, then you can have that in there. Not only does this help you in terms of having Instagram understand more about your content, it's also just a really good practice to make your content more accessible. And accessibility is something that's becoming increase I mean, look. It's not becoming increasingly important. It's always been important, but it's something increasingly that people are becoming conscious of, people are trying to implement, trying to use within what they do. And also the platforms are taking this on board, and content that is accessible is start it's very early days, but it is starting to get more visibility, and that's a trend which is going to go forwards as we go forwards.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:18:17]:\
A few things that the algorithm currently loves. So it still wants you to be active on the platform. Now I'm not saying that you need to spend all day every day active on Instagram, but when you are on Instagram, maybe be mindful of the content that you're looking at. Think about the kind of content that reflects, like your business, your blog, what you do. Try and engage with content relevant to that. It helps ins helps Instagram understand more about you as a person and people that you like to engage with, and then that they might like to engage back with you too. They might like to see your content too. Also, take the time to click and engage with stickers or comments or polls or even just liking content that you genuinely like.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:19:13]:\
It just takes a second or 2, but it does just show more that you're active on the platform. It loves it as well when you mix up content. So not just post reels because you think you need to post reels, but post reels and a carousel and a static post and some stories. The different content types allows your content to be shared to different audiences, but still all your target audience. Like, different people like different content types. It allows you to reach more people. It allows more people to engage with your content and then ultimately see your content. Original content is really important.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:20:00]:\
Instagram now, if you are the second person to post something, then it will either completely suppress or reduce the reach of that content. As I'm recording this, this is still early days in terms of Instagram implementing this, but it is doing it. It doesn't always get it right, which is a bit problematic. So if you have somebody copying your content, that's something that you need to be reporting and trying to sort of get a handle on. But content yourself, make sure it is original content, that you're not reposting memes or anything like that. Also, give people as many opportunities to engage with your content. So engagement stickers have been around on stories for a long time. They're being rolled out now onto reels.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:20:55]:\
You may on may or may not have them currently. So I'm recording this obviously quite a while before the summit is live. They're not rolled out universally yet, so you may have access to these currently. They may still be coming for you. But if you do have opportunities to make engaging for people easy, use them. The easier you make it for people to engage, and not just easy, but fun and actually a way that they want to engage, the more likely people are to to engage. If someone engages with your content, they're more likely to see future content of yours. It helps Instagram understand what kind of people like your content.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:21:39]:\
So to just, yeah, make it fun and easy to engage. And reels, 30 to second 30 to 60 second reels are great. 15 seconds, and maybe not enough time to properly draw people in to sort of follow what you're talking about. 90 seconds and people are generally bored, and they scroll through to the next video. Reels are a very short attention span situation. Make use of them, but make use of them in a way that people are going to enjoy, quickly consume, quickly deliver information to them. Okay. I want to talk to you now about some of the features that you should be using on Instagram or can use very effectively on Instagram.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:22:27]:\
So number 1, automatic replies. So think of this as a bit like your out of office email, and these can be great for delivering key information to people who sent you a message. So it could be as simple as just telling them, like, what timescale you'll be able to get back\
\
Cat Griffin [00:22:43]:\
to them in, but it\
\
Cat Griffin [00:22:44]:\
could also be, like, if you're looking to find out more, check this out. If you're looking to purchase this, check this out. So it can be a great way of giving the links directly to people without you actually being there. And you can also take this a step further and set up frequently asked questions. So these can be things like delivering, freebies, directing people to where they can purchase from you, directing people to other ways they can find out more about you. So, for example, if you are a you, for example, you teach crochet and you care for one of your frequently asked questions of where can I find great patterns for crochet? Maybe this is something you offer. So your response to that then, and again it's all automated, you can set this up in Instagram. It's quite easy to do, and the response might be check out my blog post all about great places to find crochet patterns.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:23:45]:\
All of the questions might be, how can I learn some basic crochet techniques? And you might have a freebie, a lead magnet. So the answer to that would be, here is a link to my resource all about how you can do basic crochet techniques. I hope you see I don't crochet. I don't know why I just picked this one. Hopefully, it's those examples make sense, but you get the idea. So frequently asked questions you can use to deliver a link, share a link, or directly share some information. They're really good to use because I like automatic replies. If somebody sent you a DM, they're ready to take action.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:24:27]:\
They're taking action. They're reaching out to you. Now if you're not there to reply to them, and you're not going to be there to reply to them for 2 or 3 days, the chances are that they will either have lost that momentum to take action, or they will have taken action with somebody else and found something else in that time. So having these set up means that you're giving people a way to take action right there and right then. There are also things like ManyChat and other, chatbots that you can ins install and use. These are things that you can get people to DM your keywords. So, for example, if you talk about something in a reel and you can say DM me, I don't know, bonus, or comment bonus, and these will also send people the link directly. They are really great to use.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:25:21]:\
There is a little bit more of a learning curve in setting these up, but it is something that you might want to look at. If you have a shop storefront, any kind of where people can purchase from you, if you can, connect it to Instagram. Not all platforms can be connected, but many can be. This, again, it makes if if you've made a post or a reel and that's done the hard work and it's got people wanting to take action and it's got people wanting to buy from you, if they can click directly with Instagram and get straight to that shop page to buy, then that's when they're ready to take action. As if you can't connect to a shop, absolutely do that. You can also do things like set up appointment booking on Instagram. That's something again, it's a bit more fiddly, a bit more technical to do, but definitely worth looking at if you have an appointment space business, for example. A minimum age is also something that you can use to filter if you're targeting an older audience, and you can set up a minimum age.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:26:34]:\
If you're finding that for some reason your posts are reaching a a specific country and you don't actually sell to that country, you don't ship to that country, then you can put in a high minimum you can't exclude posts from being viewed in certain countries, but you can put a high minimum wage minimum age, sorry, for viewing within that country. And then that means that, like, less people are going to see your post in that country. Like, that just it sometimes does happen that for some reason, the algorithm decides that lots of people in America wants to see your posts, but you're based in the UK and you don't ship to America. That could be a problem. This can help sort of get more people in the UK seeing your posts. Now when I am recording this, some of these features aren't quite out yet. So I'm doing a little bit of guesswork in this. But, hopefully, this is going to be true and accurate by the time you are listening to this.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:27:42]:\
Now first of all, it's not new, but notes are coming back. So notes are viewable by people when they are looking in the inbox. They also send out notifications to people when you share one. So use notes. People are just starting to use them now in lieu of x or what was found with Twitter. Story and reel comments, where you can actually, like, write comments, add notes, add things to reels, add things to stories. These have started to be rolled out to some countries. They're not everywhere, but they can be publicly visible, so they're viewable to more people seeing leads.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:28:30]:\
They send notes to your audience. They can be ways of showing your expertise. They can be ways of connecting with people. These are definitely features to explore and play with. And stickers and text layers are coming out for reels. They're, again, ways of making your reels more engaging, making your reels stand out, giving new ways for people to engage with your content. So Another quick reason why to use new features. Instagram loves it when you play around with their new features.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:29:10]:\
If they've put out a new feature, they want lots of people to see it, so it is natural that they will promote, push content that are using new features.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:29:20]:\
So give them a play, have an experiment, see how you like them. If you like them, use them. Alright. Hopefully, you enjoyed my presentation today.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:29:31]:\
If you do want to connect, then you can pop me an email or send me a message over on Instagram at Cat Gets Social.\
\
Cat Griffin [00:29:42]:\
And, yeah, thank you for\
\
Cat Griffin [00:29:44]:\
listening, and I hope you enjoyed the rest of this amazing summit.\

[00:00:03.140] - Cat Griffin\
Hi, there. Welcome to my presentation Instagram Without Overwhelm. So my name is Cat Griffin, and I'll keep the introduction short because we want to dive right in. But I am a social media strategist and a multi-passionate entrepreneur which basically means I love to talk about Instagram, but I also love to talk about audience growth, how to maximize profits from your business, how to run a business in a way that feels aligned with you, and all kinds of different things. By day, I'm actually a teacher. I work at a university in South Korea, so I basically live in a cage around a film set. It's really beautiful but quite boring at times, and I live here with my husband and my very crazy dog. All right, let's dive into the presentation because that's what we're here for, so what I'm going to cover in today's presentation is the different areas of Instagram and how they function. We're going to look at what pin posts and evergreen feeds are. I'm going to debunk some common Instagram myths for you. I'm also going to tell you why you want to reuse or repurpose your content on Instagram. So, we've a lot to cover, so let's get going.\
\
[00:01:28.400] - Cat\
So, the main areas of Instagram that you're going to be looking at is your bio, your feed posts, carousel posts, stories, reels, and highlights. And they all serve different purposes in terms of how they attract people to your account, in terms of how they can nurture people on your account, and in terms of how you can use them to grow your audience and how you can use them to sell to your audience. So starting off with your bio, so your bio is a little bit of text that describes who you are, what you do, and has a link in there. Now with your bio, by the time someone's landed on your bio, they've already seen some content of yours or they've already seen your handle somewhere else. So, they've generally already got some interest in you and finding out about more about you. So maybe they've seen a post and that's piqued their interest, so they're going to go and find out more about what you do, or maybe you've dropped your handle somewhere for people to look at what you do. Maybe they've been nosying around on your website and click through that way. So, by the time someone's gotten your bio, they've got the idea of maybe -- got a good idea -- a little bit of an idea but some idea of who you are.\
\
[00:02:53.230] - Cat\
So your bio now needs to do the really heavy lifting and persuade them that actually you are definitely somebody that they want to know more about. They're somebody they want to follow. So less is more. Remember, Instagram is primarily about the feed, about the reels, about the stories. It's not a sit down and read sort of platform. So, if you've got a long, complicated bio, you could lose people's attention. Keep it short, snappy, let people know who you are. Have a clear call to action. So, you're going to have a link on your bio. It could be your website page. It could be a freebie. It could be a current offer that you've got. You can actually have two or more links now added to the Instagram bio. That's a recent update. But make sure you've got a call to action. Why should somebody click on this link? With any kind of links that you're adding into social media, people need a really good reason to click that link and go and have a nosy because in this case and on Instagram because they want to be on Instagram. They're not on Instagram to go and find websites to search.\
\
[00:04:05.690] - Cat\
So, if you want them to go and click through to your homepage, you need a strong call to action of what they're going to get if they do click on that link to go through. An important part to remember is while Instagram is overall becoming more searchable, they're still quite limited in terms of finding people from searchability. Now, on Instagram, you've got your handle which is your @name, and people can find you by typing in the @name or a good portion of that @name. But you also have a second name on there which is, is just called your name -- the bold section, and that's the part which is just underneath your photo on Instagram, and it's where most people simply put their name. Now, it's a great idea to have your name because it does make the account much more personable -- more friendly. But this section is the only part of your bio which is searchable. So if you are, for example, a copywriter and you have copywriter in the main body of your bio people won't find you from that search term. But, if you put your name and copywriter in this bold section, then anybody searching copywriter could find your account.\
\
[00:05:28.780] - Cat\
And the more niche you are or the more specific you can be in these terms, for example, if you serve a local audience, maybe you are a baker in Manchester, if you have Manchester baker in this bold section, anybody searching for bakers in Manchester are going to find you, and there's probably not going to be much competition there. When I started my first Instagram account, I was -- it was a travel account, and I had female travel blogger in my name section. Now, if you think how many thousands, tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of people who have set up travel blogs there's, yeah, there's a lot out there, but my name came up within, depending on when it was searched, within the first 10 to 30 people if you search female travel blogger. And within the first 100 people, if just blogger, sorry, just travel blogger, so I was very easy to find. And at that time being, I was getting brand deals and all kinds of things from people because I was so easy to find by those search terms. They didn't need to go and read around and look for me. So, do make sure you use that bold section. Have key terms that your audience could be searching for on Instagram to find you and what you do.\
\
[00:06:55.720] - Cat\
And it sounds daft, and I'm definitely guilty of this last one, but keep your links updated. So people are going to click around on there. They might not necessarily click through to the actual final page, but if they do, those links should be relevant, not an offer you had out three months ago. So make sure you're keeping those updated. And if it is going to a Linktree kind of page, think carefully about which link is at the top of that Linktree because that's the one that people are going to click through to so that wants to be the most powerful one. So, if you're directing people to a lead magnet, that should be the top link. If you're directing people to book a call with you, that should be the top link. We've also got feed posts. So feed posts are the traditional feature of Instagram. They are your static images on Instagram. They started off as just being sharing an image. Now, we're sharing an image and a caption, and the trends come and go as to whether we want long-form captions or short-form captions. But regardless, the captions do need to be valuable. They need to be entertaining.\
\
[00:08:12.440] - Cat\
They need to be engaging, not just having a great day to day. The captions need to do as much heavy work, heavy lifting as the image does. Now, there's a lot of talk that we should be creating reels and feed posts are dead. There was even rumors at one point Instagram were going to stop including static images in Instagram which was very quickly dismissed by the Mosseri, who himself regularly shares images of -- images on his Instagram feed. Adam Mosseri is the head of Instagram. So if he's doing it, then, you know, they're not going anywhere. And the truth is a lot of people still love feed posts. Some people love reels. Some people love stories. Some people love feed posts. Some people love a combination of all of the above. But as long as people are liking your content and engaging with your feed posts the algorithm will show them your feed posts. So despite anything that you might have heard about them getting suppressed in the algorithm, not getting pushed as much as reels the algorithm did do that when reels first came out, but now the algorithm is showing people the kind of content they want to see. Because if they're not seeing what they want to see, they're not going to be on Instagram.\
\
[00:09:34.420] - Cat\
Instagram is not going to make money from advertising. So, providing your audience like what you are sharing, they're consuming what you're sharing, ideally engaging with what you're sharing, then they're going to keep seeing more of what you share and feed posts are still a big part of this. Now, carousels are the extension of feed posts, and carousels are where you can have multiple images but kind of as one post and these are where people swipe through. Carousels are really good for delivering value and for showing expertise. They're also good for engagement because people like to swipe through. They like to find out what's going to happen at the end of the story or the final slide of the carousel. Typically, carousel posts don't get as much reach as a feed post. But what they do do is give you a second bite of the cherry to people who are regularly consuming your content, and carousel posts are often shown to people twice. They'll get to see your first post and then maybe a few hours or even the next day, a few days later, they will get to see your second -- the second image in that post. So, they do act as a re-reminder to people that they've seen your content, that they've engaged with it, that they like you.\
\
[00:11:04.460] - Cat\
So, they are a really valuable content piece to use. Stories are a huge part of Instagram, and some people even just hang out entirely in stories either just creating stories themselves or only consuming stories. So, they're great to get into the habit of using, or you can do static images. You can do videos. You can just even do text stories. Things that work really well though are behind the scenes content videos showing what you're doing, and even showing glimpses into you outside of the business version of you. Stories are where you can be much more personable. You don't need to keep everything business-like which I'm putting in, you know, that [inaudible 00:11:58] there, but stories are where you get to be real and you get to show up. And you can show up every day multiple times a day really giving people the chance to get to know you. And you can share a mixture of tutorials, a mixture of value and also a mixture of personality-packed content. And stories really help keep you front of mind. If people are seeing you several times a day, they're going to remember you and they're going to see you much more in stories than they're likely to see you in the feed.\
\
[00:12:35.310] - Cat\
Now, stories don't reach new audiences. The only time a story will reach a new audience is if somebody shares that story or if somebody's already landed on your account and they're having a nosy around. So they might not be a follower, but they've got to your account from some means and they're already clicking through on your account, but they won't organically be shared to new people. So they are all about nurturing, building relationships with your current audience. Now, stories come with all kinds of amazing stickers that you can use that can be fantastic as a business owner. So you've got the obvious which is you can put a link right in stories. Now, like I talked about with the bio, if you are putting links in stories, people are often reluctant to click on those links because they want to stay on Instagram. They want to keep clicking through stories. So, do use the links sparingly, and when you are using them have really strong call to action. If you are wanting people to go to a link a more I'm going to say effective but a higher conversion rate of doing this is often to use another form of sticker.\
\
[00:13:56.930] - Cat\
So you could, for example, have the call to action who would like my free guide to choosing colors that match your mood. I don't know where that came from, but anyway, that's our free guide. So I'm going to put a poll sticker up and I could have two options like, heck yes, and I would love that. So we've got two positive options. Don't do a negative. We don't need negatives. We've got two positive options. Anyone who clicks on that poll sticker, you can then send them a DM with a link to that free guide. They've given you permission to do this because they've said that they want your free guide. So, this is a way that you can get this link to them without having -- without them having to click away from the stories that they're enjoying. But it also has another really valuable purpose. You send them a DM with the link and you can also say, hey, let me know if you've got any questions. It creates the opportunity for you to start a conversation with that person. They can ask you questions. You can offer an additional tip when you share the link. You can make a comment about something you've seen on their feed. You can start to become a real person who's interacting with them in their inbox.\
\
[00:15:21.930] - Cat\
This is a fantastic opportunity. Firstly, the algorithm loves it. If somebody has had a conversation with you in the DMs, Instagram thinks that this person absolutely loves your content. They love you. They're your biggest fan. They want to talk to you which means your future content is going to get pushed to this person. And because this person knows you, you have had a bit of a chat in the DMs they're going to remember you. They're going to take a note of this content that's shared, and they're maybe going to engage or consume it and that the snowball grows. They're more likely then to see future content, and this is how you can really start to build relationships and community. You can also use these story stickers for all kinds of market research. You can use polls asking your audience what they want to see from you. You can use quizzes to assess your audience's current knowledge on something or where they're currently at, and you can use quizzes to build them up to something. So, for example, I could have a quiz saying, you know, our story is good for reaching new audiences. And if people are answering yes, and then they, oh, well then \
\
[00:16:40.990] - Cat\
you need my guide on Instagram where I will teach you how to reach new audiences. So, you can use quizzes to direct people to where you want them to be. There's all kinds of ask me questions stickers. You can ask people just simply to pop in an emoji via a sticker. These again can be ways that you get permission to get into people's DMs and engage with them. I'm going to talk about Reels. Reels are the, the hot thing on Instagram, and they've been around now since 2020 -- 2020 and they are still going strong, but not as strong as they once were, and the reason is some people absolutely love reels. Some people don't want to consume reels at all, and Instagram have had to account for this fact. Reels can be great for getting reach. You'll hear about reels exploding and going viral, but they're not as good as they first were. They're not getting the initial push out when a new feature comes. They've lost that initial one. So you can still get great reach with reels, but you're not going to get great reach just because you're sharing a reel. It has to -- I mean part of it is luck. But it has to be really something that will resonate with your audience.\
\
[00:18:14.050] - Cat\
It has to be posted at a good time when your audience are active. And you -- you can can use things like trending music, trending filters. They can help reach a little bit, but again, these are not the -- like when reels first came out within the first of six months, if you used a trending audio, you were guaranteed great reach. Now a trending audio and a bit of luc k will get you great reach. But the trending audio itself isn't the be all and end all to getting you that great reach. But where reels are fantastic is they're great for delivering bite-size value pieces. You can quickly share knowledge in a very consumable way. They're brilliant for showing your personality. But people behave differently towards reels. People are much less likely to click away from reels to go and check out your profile. So while you might get lots of viewers of a reel, you might even get lots of followers from a reel people have followed from within rather than actually going to check out your bio and really getting to know you as a typical rule. The way the algorithm and the way that reels are delivered on the app is to keep people in the reels tab for as long as possible.\
\
[00:19:45.150] - Cat\
They want to just keep going to the next video, the next video, the next video. So, they can be a great way for getting reached. They can be a great way for getting followers. They're on their own. They're not a great way for, for example, if you're doing a sale and you've got thousands and thousands of views on a reel, that's not likely to convert to a great number of sales on its own unless a large portion of those people already know you. So, if it's new people landing on a reel, they're unlikely to convert from that reel because they're, they're clicking through to the next reel. Reels as well can be more challenging to reach a target audience. Now, this is getting better as the algorithm has developed. But especially at the beginning, people were making a reel they were getting hundreds of thousands of views, thousands of new followers, and then their engagement overall was tanking because the new followers were not their ideal clients. And the reel had been shown to people who weren't their ideal audience based on the music that was used, based on these filters that are being used, based on the transitions, all these kinds of things.\
\
[00:21:06.950] - Cat\
That's less of a problem now. But it is harder to actually reach a target audience with reels, partly because of the mindset when you're creating reels. There is this mindset that we need to make them super entertaining and super on current trends. And actually, what we really need to focus on is, does this reel have content which is relevant, educational, is going to speak directly to my target audience. And yes, I might reach less people in that situation, but the people I do reach are the people who are going to be interested in my content overall and they are going to stick around. Your highlights, so this is when you can save a story. So you've created a story that only lasts for 24 hours. You've saved it to highlights, and they're a really, really, really valuable asset to your IG feed. But they're often forgotten about or overlooked by people when they're creating things. But in terms of consumers, in terms of people landing on your feed, they're actually where they'll stop and look before they -- so that's where they'll first dive into quite often. So you've got your feed. You've got at the top you've got your bio and underneath there is where your highlights.\
\
[00:22:35.050] - Cat\
So someone's landed on your page, they've read your bio, and they're going to start clicking through those highlights to get a feel about you and what you do. So, if you don't have highlights there, they can't do this. If your highlights are a year old, two years old, they look really outdated that doesn't really reflect well. And if your highlights are just not relevant, that's not going to help you either. So a lot of people sort of got in the habit quite early creating their Instagram accounts and they'd save things to highlights and, you know, you can have different highlights under different topics, but they wouldn't really have done this very strategically and then they've just been left there. So their highlights that are old. The highlights aren't really that relevant. The highlights that don't really serve a purpose. When in fact, if you're really strategic about these highlights, I say that they can operate as a, I'm British, so I'm going to say a flyer, I think pamphlet, like mini booklet about you, your business, what you do. Now, less is definitely more. People have got short attention spans. If you've put tens upon tens or even tens of highlights up there, people are going to get bored.\
\
[00:23:51.430] - Cat\
So, you want to be very strategic about what you choose and choose the best things that will showcase you. Now, I always recommend maybe having three different highlight topics and between three and six highlights within each one. Any more than that and you're getting into the people exiting out, getting bored, sort of territory. And the three topics I recommend for highlights are, first of all, have one which is about you. So, this is where people get to know you a little bit. It doesn't have to be personal. It could be behind the scenes content. It could be you sharing things about your business, but things that actually show you, show your personality. I also recommend that you have a highlight which is your best offerings, so to speak, your showcase offers and keep this short and concise. And then also a highlight of feedback, testimonials, reviews that you've got from people that is social proof. And social proof in your highlights here will do a lot of heavy lifting. It really helps such -- we'll talk about the like and old trust factor, but that takes a while to build up. But social proof helps nudge people in the direction of trusting you because if they're seeing other people trust you, then well, you know, they've got every reason to trust you too.\
\
[00:25:29.510] - Cat\
And try and make sure these highlights are very focused. So, if you want to share a specific offer, the highlights are very focused on the offer and you've not just thrown everything at it. And try and make sure that they're personality driven. Make sure that by watching your highlights people can get a good idea about who you are, and what your style is, what the kind of content you create will be. All right, so now I want to just go through a few myths and debug them for you. So we hear a lot about it's the algorithm. The algorithm is not working for me. The algorithm hates me. The algorithm's changed. Firstly, the algorithm doesn't have any major changes that often. The algorithm does shift and makes changes, but this is in response to people's behavior rather than it being sort of effectively reprogrammed. The algorithm is responsive. And the algorithm isn't working against you. Instagram doesn't want the algorithm to work against you. Instagram wants people to be happy on the platform. Which is why, if you start trying to fight the algorithm and you start trying to chase getting followers and getting likes and doing the things you think just to keep the algorithm happy, that's when it does start to work against you because it starts to get confused.\
\
[00:27:02.680] - Cat\
If you focus on creating content, which is what your target audience wants to see, it's valuable content, it's engaging content for your target audience Instagram will show your content to your target audience. It will show content to people it thinks will like your content, and you will organically grow. If you start trying to force that, you start to get confused which is why I'm going to jump number four, why follow-for-follow threads are not a great way to grow. So when you share a piece of content on Instagram, Instagram will share that content based on a few factors. It will share it to around 10 percent of your audience initially, and the audience it shares it with are people who are active, recently active on the platform, but people who have engaged with your content recently and your new followers. Because if someone just followed you, Instagram thinks that, hey, they must love your content, right? They've just found your account. They've just followed you. They must love your content. So they will get high priority. So if you've done a follow-for-follow thread and then you've done a thread maybe of liking people's comments, any kind of fake engagement thread like that\
\
[00:28:34.080] - Cat\
Instagram is going to think that these people are your target audience. They're going to think that these people love your content because they've just followed you. They've just engaged with you. But the reality is a lot of them won't be your target audience. Even if you're in a group of people that are maybe similar business people to you, are they your target audience, really? And the answer most of them won't be. And even if you do find a group of people that are 100% your target audience, you're not going to be the person for all of them. So, what you're going to do is you're going to have people follow you, people engage with you, for the follow back, for the like back. Instagram is then going to show these people your content the next time you share something. And because you're now no longer in the follow-for-follow thread, you're no, no longer in this fake engagement scenario, these people aren't going to engage with you because there's no reason for them to. You know, they're not following you for your content. They're not obliged to in any way. They're just not going to engage back with you.\
\
[00:29:43.770] - Cat\
This tells Instagram that your content is low quality because these people that loved you a couple of days ago now don't want to engage with your content. What else should they think? So, it won't show your content any further and the reach of that post will be reduced and this kind of becomes a reverse snowball effect. So as more and more people are not engaging with you because it will become more and more these recent followers that get showing your content, your organic followers, people who do love what you do, people who do want to see your content won't be shown your content. And, okay, off my soapbox with that one. So the next one is you don't need to keep up with reel trends. I talked about this a little bit before. You -- the way that reels work now is trends are not the be all and end all. It's much more important to focus on creating content, firstly, that you enjoy creating and which will resonate -- which will deliver value to your target audience. And shocker, you don't even need to create reels at all. If you absolutely hate creating reels and this is stopping you using the platform because you feel you should be creating reels or nothing, then just don't create reels.\
\
[00:31:10.090] - Cat\
There's still feed posts. They're still doing great. You can still use stories. You can create carousels. You do not have to use reels if you don't want to. And then the final one is that you need to have a beautiful feed. Okay. A beautiful feed might be a tiny nudge in getting someone to follow you. But if you think about when someone lands on your feed, they've either got to your feed because they have seen content you've already shared and they're interested, so they've gone to find out more. Or they've been on your website and they've clicked the link through to your Instagram to find out more. Or somebody's recommended you as a great person to follow, so they've gone to find out more. By the time they're actually on your feed, they're already interested in you. So yes, a beautiful feed might make them stop and think wow this is a really nice feed. This looks great. But in all honesty, they're really looking at what the content is and is that content interesting and relevant to them. So if you are naturally creative, you're naturally artistic, you naturally are brilliant at putting together cohesive feeds, fantastic.\
\
[00:32:32.420] - Cat\
Do that. But if you have no idea about how to create color schemes and matching posts and all that, don't worry about it. You don't need to do it. Okay. Final couple of things and pinned posts -- so a couple of years ago, Instagram added the possibility of pinning posts at the top of your feed, and you can pin three posts. These can be brilliant in two main situations. If you are running a specific sale or promotion, you can use these top three posts to promote that. And day to day, you can use these top three posts a little bit like how we talked with highlights to showcase the best of your business. So again, you could have one which talks about you -- what you do. You could have one which showcases your best services. One which showcases your testimonials. Or they could be three really, really great value pieces of content with really strong call to actions. But you want three really strong pieces of content up here which are going to either direct people to where you want them to go outside Instagram, if that's your goal. Or they're going to be really good incentives for people to follow you because, hey, this content looks amazing.\
\
[00:34:08.880] - Cat\
And evergreen feeds -- so we're starting to hear quite a bit about evergreen feeds, and there's two main functions of when you would use an Evergreen feed. Number one is if you only want to create reels, but you want to have a beautiful feed when people come and have a look at your feed. Now, I don't recommend an evergreen feed in that situation because I don't think it's representative who you are. So, if you're creating content that's reels and people land on your feed and just see this very curated sort of static feed that doesn't give them an indication of what content they're going to get from you. Personally, I feel it's much better to not worry about having that beautiful feed and having those reels up there so people can see the content you create, the content you share, get to see who you are, and decide if you are right from them -- for them based on what you actually do, what you actually share. And if you really want to make it a beautiful feed, you can actually put covers onto your reels. So it's not like you can't still have a curated feed when making reels. So, my personal advice is don't use an evergreen feed in that situation.\
\
[00:35:24.600] - Cat\
But perhaps you want to take a break from Instagram, or perhaps you just never want to use Instagram at all. Despite everything I've talked to you about today, you're like, nope, I don't use Instagram. An evergreen feed is essentially for a nine or a 12 grid, and quite often they're sort of a cohesive image or a puzzle feed. They look beautiful, and you post this once and you never post again. So you would use this to really showcase who you are, what your offers are. And you would do this in the instance that you don't want to be active on the platform, but you know your audience are going to go and look for you on the platform. These days so many people when trying to suss out a business or a person, they go to Instagram to find out -- find out more about them. So, if they can't find anything, you're taking away the opportunity for someone to get to know you better. So, if you have an evergreen feed, this serves as a place where people can get to know more about you, if they've gone looking for you. It doesn't allow you to grow. It doesn't attract new audiences.\
\
[00:36:40.500] - Cat\
It's a very, very, very tiny growth, if any, you will get from an evergreen feed. It's literally there for people who go and actively look for you. Now, most people when they teach the evergreen feed, they will only talk about the content that you need in the actual grid. When I teach evergreen feeds, I teach it's also just as important that you have those highlights on perfection and your bio on perfection. This is your one chance after all for people to be seeing the content you've shared. Make sure you've got the whole experience of the blending on your feed doing all the work for you, really letting them get a good feel for you and who you are. And final quick point is I do want to say it's okay to repurpose your content. So, if you don't want to be constantly churning out new content, then you can repurpose content. And it does help people if you repurpose content. If you think people need to see something multiple times in order to really get a good idea, you know, in order to take action, then repurposing your content gives you the opportunity to reshare advice, reshare your message with your audience.\
\
[00:38:04.400] - Cat\
So, you're actually helping them to take action on the advice that you're sharing. If you are reusing content or repurposing content, you can use your insights on Instagram as a way to see what content your audience want to see again or want to see more of. You can also take advantage of things like anniversaries -- I shared this a year ago, it's still amazing today -- or a throwback post similarly and you can use it to add a fresh look to something. Or if there's current events, you can go back to an old post and give it an update of I shared this last year. This has changed, but the rest is still great. Or you can just simply reshare something and say, hey, this is so valuable. You need to know this. If you missed it last time, I'm sharing it again, so that you don't miss it. And don't be scared to do this because do you remember what you posted six months ago? Probably not. And I can almost guarantee your audience won't remember what you posted six months ago. So resharing, repurposing that content is not going to look bad at all. Okay. Well, that's me done.\
\
[00:39:19.310] - Cat\
Hopefully you found that valuable. If you do have any questions, then please do reach out to me. You can find me over on Instagram or send me an email. And if you are looking for help with content creation, I do have a $9 a month social media membership. If that's anything of interest, then do get in touch. Thank you so much for sticking with me throughout this, and I hope you're enjoying all the rest of the amazing presentations. It's been a brilliant summit so far. Thank you and goodbye.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.610] - Dan\
Hey, this is Dan Morris. I am the head of audience industry, which runs Tracing the Path podcast, findingjoy.net, which is a blog that my wife Rachel runs, and the Orange Circle, which is an elite mastermind. Today I wanted to talk to you about what I do for my 20 minutes in the morning when I drink my hot chocolate. Most people drink coffee, but I'm more of a hot chocolate, and it's probably the most efficient use of time that I use all day. And it has produced the greatest amount of traffic and exposure to my podcast and blogs more than pretty much anything I do other than SEO.\
\
[00:01:00.640] - Dan\
So, I thought that I would break down what we do. If you're looking to make the most of your 20 minutes every morning when you sit down and have your coffee or hot chocolate, this is about the best activity I can think of for you to do. So, the most important part about this plan is that I figured out, I don't know when I figured this out, but I did figure out that there are people in this world who need to share your content. Like they need to, not that they want to, or that it would be nice if they did, but they actually need to.\
\
[00:01:41.100] - Dan\
And I did that, I realized that when I had a client who had a newsletter. It was actually a dentist office, and they had a newsletter, and they asked that our social media team makes sure that every week they send out a newsletter and have dentist relevant stuff in it, dental, you know, news, technology, whatever. Which meant that we had to go scour the Internet for interesting things about industry, which meant we needed to share someone's content. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:02:16.000] - Dan\
Like, that was our job. We needed to find the content and we had to share it. And in this particular case, they had 7500 people on their email list. So, we would be sharing, like, for instance, your content with 7500 people. But I will tell you that that was just the beginning, because in the end, some people that have shared our content have a million people on the list.\
\
[00:02:43.990] - Dan\
So, finding the people who have a best interest in your content is the first part. Now, you already know from SEO that if people are searching for a specific topic and they on Google, because this is what you do as well, right? You Google something and then you go to the web page that Google takes you to. So, if people are searching for something and then they go to your page, they have a vested interest in that topic because that's what they're looking for. They either want a solution or funny or entertainment, or they're trying to figure something out, but whatever it is, they search for it and then they find it.\
\
[00:03:18.700] - Dan\
Well, other people talk about your topic on the Internet. They talk about it on Reddit. They talk about it on Twitter. They talk about it on blogs. They talk about it wherever it can be talked about.\
\
[00:03:32.970] - Dan\
They're interested in it. They're looking for it. An example might be a runner, somebody who is a casual runner. They might run every day, and on Twitter, they might talk about their runs. Ran 6 miles today.\
\
[00:03:47.360] - Dan\
You know, gearing up for a race next month, doing a 10K in two months. Just started a marathon program. You know, they're talking about running. Why is that? Because they're runners.\
\
[00:03:58.330] - Dan\
They're interested in running. So, what if you had a running blog? Wouldn't it be useful to be in front of people who are talking about running all the time? Not just when they're searching, but also when they're looking to talk about, looking to tweet about it, want to discuss something, want to get a reply. They want somebody to ask a question like, what if you could find those people?\
\
[00:04:23.060] - Dan\
So, I use a software product called Talk Walker. Now, there's another one that you're probably more familiar with, and that's called Google Alerts. But Google Alerts is not a supported program anymore, so I'm assuming that someday will just die, and I don't really want all my stuff to someday disappear. So, I moved over to Talk Walker, which is a supported service, and it's free. And so, what I want you to do is I want you to figure out and in the beginning, it will be a little bit nebulous, but I want you to figure out, what are 30 things, because with a Talk Walker account, you get 30 free keywords, what are 30 things that if somebody was talking about it on the Internet, you would know those are your people? What could those 30 things be? So, for me, with my podcast, Tracing the Path, one of those was the story that I did about the authors of the Curious George, Margaret and H A Ray.\
\
[00:05:28.910] - Dan\
I don't know if you know this, but Margaret and H A Ray were living in Paris right before World War II when the Germans were invading, and they actually escaped Paris on a bicycle that they built with a basket. And in the basket, they had the manuscript for the Curious George book. You know, it's kind of like, how amazing is that? Well, so they were escaping Nazi Germany. It's a World War II tale.\
\
[00:05:56.830] - Dan\
It's Curious george. So, I know if anyone is talking about the history of children's books, they might be interested in the podcast episode about Curious George, right? So, history of children's books, that is something people actually talk about.\
\
[00:06:11.530] - Dan\
There are actual children's book historians, there's librarians, there's children's book librarians. There's all kinds of people who would be interested in that particular story. So, go through your blog or your podcast or whatever and think about, all right, what are the topics, what are the things? And even in a more granular way, more specific, more helpful would be to pull out either 30 podcast episodes or 30 blog posts or 30 YouTube videos, right? And figure out, all right, what is the main point of this? What is the keyword?\
\
[00:06:46.080] - Dan\
What is the type of person that would be interested in this particular piece of content? And we're going to put those into Talkwalker. Now, what Talkwalker does is every single day it scours the entire Internet, which I don't know how it's possible, but they do for whatever word or words you put into it. So, if you're putting in children historian, then anytime the word children historian ever comes up on the Internet, not children historian, children's book historian, anytime that comes up on the Internet, you're going to get an email.\
\
[00:07:23.650] - Dan\
And for the most part, you can set it up so you can get one every day. Thus, need 20 minutes drinking your hot chocolate or coffee in the morning. So, if somebody and people don't usually say this, but if somebody on Twitter says, hi, I'm Stan, I'm a children's book historian, you will get an email tomorrow morning, or you could set it up for today that says, hey, here's a tweet that might be of interest to you, and you'll take you directly to it. It will be Stan's account.\
\
[00:07:53.440] - Dan\
And you'll see the tweet on your screen. It will say, hey, I'm a children's book historian. Now, this is a potential reader of your blog. This is a potential listener of your podcast. So, what if you said, oh, that is fascinating.\
\
[00:08:06.870] - Dan\
I actually have a blog where I talk about children's books, right? That would be interesting to the person, potentially, and maybe here's my favorite one, what do you know about the story? Or maybe even you're researching a story and you actually need help. Maybe you already know that you're working on another blog post and you're like, hey, a children's books historian, I'm working on a project, what do you know about X? Like, you found a potential reader., Now you create a conversation. So, you could get 30 of those every morning and go through them and find out which ones could actually become listeners or which ones could become readers. Who are these people?\
\
[00:08:50.140] - Dan\
Because some of them, this particular children's book historian might work at a library. The library might have the newsletter, and the newsletter might need content, and the guy just needs access to content. So, as you can see, if you did this 30 times every day, every morning, and reached out to people who are actual, real-life potential readers or listeners of your content, that over time, that can really build into something. But what I have found is that there's a more important, like, side feature to this strategy that I didn't know at the beginning. Because what I just described to you is what I attempted in the beginning, is I'll just use my 20 minutes to reach people who have a direct interest in what it is that I'm talking about.\
\
[00:09:38.740] - Dan\
And in fact, we had a client who had a house plants blog, and she ended up talking to all kinds of people who just were experts at house plants, gardeners, people who love to talk about the different house plants, and, you know, the different lighting and where do you put it in the house, and different, you know does your house face north? Where should you put it?\
\
[00:09:57.130] - Dan\
All those kinds of things. And she ended up creating this huge community of people who love house plants and that ended up being the people who bought the ebook and all that other stuff. But there was another aspect to this that I didn't know at first. My wife is crawling behind me to reach something. Okay, that was funny. that was funny. So, the thing that I didn't know was going to happen is I put in keywords. For instance, I have a post about the history of pizza and it just so happens that history of pizza is tied to the cholera epidemic. So, I found somebody talking about cholera in Italy on using Talkwalker, I think I had changed some keywords at that point.\
\
[00:10:56.370] - Dan\
And then I was just like, well, maybe there are people who are talking about cholera. So, I found somebody talking about cholera and I said, hey, I see that you were talking about cholera. I don't know if you know this or not, but because of cholera, that is why we have pizza. And I included the link to the episode and she listened to it and she wrote back, you have made my day. I am a cholera historian and I'm putting this in my newsletter immediately.\
\
[00:11:27.700] - Dan\
Like all of a sudden she had some enormous database of people interested in cholera. And now I have all kinds of new listeners because I found this one person on Twitter. The same thing happened with the Curious George episode, is the National Museum, Holocaust Museum found, I saw them tweeting about something. And I sent them a little note that said, hey, I don't know if you know this, but the writers of Curious George actually escaped Germany. They were Jewish writers.\
\
[00:12:01.200] - Dan\
They escaped Germany and thus escaped the Holocaust. And so, they put the information into the National Holocaust newsletter. And it's been there three times.\
\
[00:12:14.060] - Dan\
I did a story on Paul Harvey, who's a radio guy, and he got into radio because his music teacher took him to the radio station. So, I was talking about that on Twitter with a music teacher. And then the music teacher ended up sharing that with other music teachers and they shared that with other music teachers because guess what? Here's a music teacher then ends up being a hero in a story. They led a young boy to the radio and then the radio guy became famous.\
\
[00:12:42.340] - Dan\
So, they had a vested interest in sharing the story with all of the music teachers because it made everybody feel good. Like, yes, here's a cool story about something a music teacher did. So, I want you to think about that with your content. Like, can you find 30 pieces of content? And remember, this is just 30 today.\
\
[00:13:07.810] - Dan\
You can change them, you can alter them and the one thing that you will find out is that you'll put in keywords in the Talkwalker. Like I have an episode about the Oregon Trail game and how it is directly tied to the history of Apple computers. Like if the Oregon Trail game wasn't around, Apple computers wouldn't be around either. So I started putting in history of Apple. Like who's talking about the history of Apple?\
\
[00:13:34.470] - Dan\
Well, I found out very quickly that many people talk about the history of apple pie, and that was not a good use of time getting an email with a list of people talking about the history of apple pie. So, you might want to do a little brush up on your Boolean search terms because I had to change my search in Talkwalker from history of apple to history of apple in quotes and then minus p i e, minus pie because I didn't want Talkwalker to bring back anything that had to do with apple pie, just Apple computers.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:10.580] - Doreen Vanderhart, knapcreative.ca\
I am so glad that you're here. I'm very, very excited to sit down with you and talk to you about how to uncomplicate your marketing, but those of you that haven't met me yet my name is Doreen.\
\
[00:00:20.000] - Doreen\
I am the heart and soul behind Knap Creative and that's what we're here for. We uncomplicate your marketing so that you can get seen, get heard and get results. So that's really what we're all about. I super appreciate your time, so I'm not going to waste any of it. We're going to dive right in. This is going to be action packed, value packed. I hope that you have your notebook because you're going to want to take notes.\
\
[00:00:40.430] - Doreen\
And of course, you can always catch the replay again later. Uncomplicating your marketing. When you sit down and think about your marketing plan, what does that look like? So I'm guessing the first few things that popped into your head are kind of presented as a list where it's like email marketing, maybe Facebook, Instagram, you name it, a social media platform. You know, chances are if that's the case, you feel like you're constantly hustling and doing all the things to get the word out about your business, but you're not necessarily seeing the traction that you want to see.\
\
[00:01:11.330] - Doreen\
You're not seeing a steady flow of new clients. Maybe you're in a bit of a feast or famine cycle. You know, you're showing up on Instagram consistently. Check it off the list. You've got a weekly blog or a podcast or a news... You know, you name it, check it off the list or maybe none of the above. And you're feeling super guilty about it. Totally been there. Zero judgment, super common. You're absolutely not alone.\
\
[00:01:33.500] - Doreen\
So if despite doing all of the marketing things or trying to do all the marketing things that you feel like you should be doing, the results aren't showing up. Maybe I know it's very easy to get in a weird headspace, like maybe it's because you're not doing reels yet, or maybe you're hashtags are super sucky or, you know, maybe you straight up don't have what people are looking for. So it can be very easy to get into kind of a spin about that.\
\
[00:01:57.830] - Doreen\
So first thing right out the gate, I'm going to say, nope, none of that is the problem. We're going to dig into that and get down to the very, very nitty gritty of it. So first thing I will say is that strategy and tactics are usually implemented backwards. So if your social media are your marketing plan feels like like a lot of like, oh, look at this new feature or check your engagement or how many followers do you have now, that kind of stuff.\
\
[00:02:24.050] - Doreen\
Stop it. That's not going to get you anywhere. So a marketing to do list is not a strategy unless it all works together to turn your community into paying clients. So tactics are kind of that's like like I said, it's like your engagement. How many followers, the new features, all the things that are constantly rolling out can be extremely overwhelming and it can be very hard to keep up. Those are tactics. So the strategy is kind of the foundation underneath it.\
\
[00:02:51.410] - Doreen\
So I always look at this kind of like an ice cream cone where the tactics are the sprinkles, like they're great to have. They're delicious, they're lovely, but they're not the most important thing. So you want to get the ice cream in the cone first, and that's what we're going to talk about today. So we're not going to get into the specifics on a lot of tactics because those change every frickin second. So so we're not going to get into that.\
\
[00:03:13.340] - Doreen\
We're going to get into the foundation. That's the most important part. Once you have a handle on that, the tactics are like the sprinkles and you can just kind of do what works for you and what feels for you. Good for you. And I promise it will work.\
\
[00:03:24.290] - Doreen\
So first thing, we're going to step it way back to the very, very almost before the beginning. But this is something that probably doesn't pop into your head when you think about your marketing plan. But it's the most important part, that is your client experience. So at the end of the day, this is what really matters. Like you can spend so many hours and so many dollars on marketing or on your social media, but if your client experience sucks, you're honestly you're not going to get anywhere.\
\
[00:03:52.970] - Doreen\
Whereas on the other side of the coin, like if you have a really impeccable client experience, people are going to be shouting your name from the rooftops. You're going to get referrals, you're going to get that word of mouth. You haven't even opened a social media app. You have not to stress about it for a second. And you already have a marketing strategy in place. So the best marketing strategy ever is to truly from the heart. I know it sounds corny.\
\
[00:04:14.510] - Doreen\
It totally is. I'm all about that, is to care about your client and the people that you work with. So and I should even, not even your client. But if you're if you're on social media or anything like that about your, your readers, like whether they're going to buy from you or not, you have your perfect fit person, really just put yourself in their shoes and do whatever you can to be helpful.\
\
[00:04:37.040] - Doreen\
We'll get into that stuff later. But really, it comes down to caring about your person.\
\
[00:04:41.870] - Doreen\
So once you've done that, once you do know that you have a really good client experience and I know that nothing is ever perfect but, you know, knock their socks off as much as you can, then you want to do the stuff that you do, you think of when you think of marketing.\
\
[00:04:55.340] - Doreen\
So let's jump into that. The first thing that we always, always, always start with is goals.\
\
[00:05:02.630] - Doreen\
So we do have on our website knapcreative.ca/resources has a free workbook for this part, so I hope you brought your notebook, you can definitely jot down some notes as we're doing this, but if you I'm a sucker for a good workbook. So if you are like me and you want to have a beautiful plan that's properly formatted, definitely go check that out. It's totally free so you can just download it. Knapcreative.ca/resources.\
\
[00:05:31.660] - Doreen\
So the first thing that we're going to do with our goals is kind of, I guess, a gut check. So what you want to do is you want to jot down what you'd like to see more of and less of in your life. So legit just two columns like more and less. Some things that are overwhelming you or things that you would like to opt out of, go into last column, obviously, and then things that you want to lean in to go in the more columns.\
\
[00:05:51.380] - Doreen\
So what do you want your life to look like? Because if you're not thinking about that when you're creating your goals...\
\
[00:05:58.530] - Doreen\
We need to that's the most important part. So make sure that you are really looking at what you want your actual life to look like and not just at your financial business goals or the impact that you want to make, things like that. But just like the day to day little minutia that you want your life to look like, we need to make sure that we're checking in with ourselves on that stuff.\
\
[00:06:21.570] - Doreen\
The next thing, we're going to get a little bit more technical and a little bit more business. We want to look at the last 12 months. So the first thing that you need to check is what drove the most revenue. So, yeah, what was what was the what was the biggest income driver in your business? And then the second thing like revenue and profits can be two very different things. So make sure that whatever is driving revenue is actually profitable as well, because, yeah, we just need to make sure that we're aligned on those two things.\
\
[00:06:47.580] - Doreen\
And then you want to look at the other side of the coin, too, like, what about the least revenue? So I know as entrepreneurs you can have a lot of ideas and some of them are awesome and some of them think like they feel awesome at first, but then they don't really land the way that we want them to land. But it can be very easy to get attached to those goals. And I'm speaking from personal experience here.\
\
[00:07:08.100] - Doreen\
So look at those things like what is not driving revenue in your business? How much effort does it require? Like if it's costing you a lot of your bandwidth and it's not really driving revenue? Maybe it's time to let it go.\
\
[00:07:20.340] - Doreen\
Yeah, I know it can be really emotionally attached to these ideas, but maybe you can let it go for now and revisit it in three months or six months or a year. But maybe now it's just not the time for that particular offer. So then once you have that information and of course there's going to be stuff in between, but just kind of evaluate what's working and what's not working, then you want to use that information to break down your offerings for the next a little bit.\
\
[00:07:44.880] - Doreen\
So some people are really good at setting five year goals or one year goals or like doing the big picture stuff. And some people that's a lot to bite off. So I say look at at least the next three months and then kind of have a general idea of the next year ish, if you can. But do what works for you, obviously. So you want to break out the next 3 to 12 months and here's what you want to look at.\
\
[00:08:09.640] - Doreen\
So you want to first look at, you actually want to first look at what your sales goal is. So how much money do you need to or want to make in the next 3 to 12 months? Then you want to look at your offer and the price of that offer. And then you'll know once you have those three things, you're going to know exactly how many of your offer you're going to need to sell in order to make the revenue that you want to make.\
\
[00:08:30.870] - Doreen\
And then again, on number four and five revenue, you need to look at that, obviously, but also make sure that you're not forgetting about your take home pay because you need to make sure that you are being compensated for all of your hard work. Absolutely. So very important. So then this is going to give you a really good idea of what your goals actually are. That's a really good place to start. So once you have that, then we are going to look at the seasonal shifts in your business.\
\
[00:08:54.930] - Doreen\
So you want to take note of any important dates. And this is also applies to your life, right? So if you want to take a vacation on a certain day, like make sure that you're making note of that when you're creating your marketing plan, you want to look at national holidays, launches, promotions, like if you have any seasons that are particular busy for selling, you know, maybe you're super busy in the summer and it dies off in the winter or the other way around.\
\
[00:09:17.610] - Doreen\
Maybe Christmas is really busy or fall if you're a photographer, if fall is really, really busy. So just depending on your industry and what you do, you're going to have seasons that are, that are, you know, a little more packed than other ones. So one thing, for the year in advance is that I do is that I actually have it jotted down. You can see it's a total disaster, but I write down the kind of vibe that's happening for my perfect customer at any point in time.\
\
[00:09:45.690] - Doreen\
So I know that, you know, on the third week of June, the moms are ready to throw dog treats in their kids' lunches because they're so ready to just be done with all of it. You know, September is like a mini new year. It's really a fresh start. It's kind of yeah, it's it's really like a mini new year for for a lot of people that are in business.\
\
[00:10:04.230] - Doreen\
You know, on September 27, the leaves are perfect in southern Alberta where I live, you know, just like making note of all the things that are happening, this is going to be hard to do right out the gate, like you're going to have a general idea. But make sure you keep track of this throughout the year and you are going to have this is marketing gold for you. Like, the longer you do this, the better it is.\
\
[00:10:25.650] - Doreen\
So I definitely recommend just printing off a piece of paper and keeping this handy.\
\
[00:10:30.240] - Doreen\
I always have this sitting on my desk like for years, and it's been really good because I can be very proactive about what's happening in my client's life. And instead of, like waiting for the for the feeling to come and then addressing it then or even missing it altogether.\
\
[00:10:45.360] - Doreen\
So super handy to have. OK, so then once you've got that, then we can sit down and actually create a marketing plan.\
\
[00:10:54.960] - Doreen\
So first I'm geek out with you guys a little bit about the customer journey, so the customer journey, I know that sounds technical and jargony, but trust me, it's not that complicated. It always proceeds in the same order. So this is like any relationship in any person's life. It always starts with curiosity. You meet someone, you run across somebody, you're curious about them, and then you get to chatting. You have conversations with this person.\
\
[00:11:24.150] - Doreen\
And then eventually, eventually you're going to be friends, you're going to get married like, you know, you're going to do whatever the next step. Right. So same thing goes for your your brand and your business relationship.\
\
[00:11:35.220] - Doreen\
So it's kind of like it's kind of like a game of supermario where you enter the little world and you have to go through all the hoops to get to the end. Same goes for your business. You can't sell unless you've gone through all the hoops. Right. Like you can't invite them into working with you until you've nurture that relationship and all the other stuff. So these are the phases of the customer journey. First, you're going to attract someone to your brand, then you're going to nurture that relationship with all of your excellent content that we're going to get to.\
\
[00:12:01.770] - Doreen\
Then you're going to invite them into working with you and then you're going to delight them. You're going to knock your socks off with a really impeccable client experience. So that's the customer journey. We're going to take off each of these sections and we're going to dive into each one. So we're going to talk a little bit of attract, nurture, invite, delight and come up with a strategy so that you have a really well-rounded marketing plan and nobody's falling through the cracks and getting forgotten because, yeah, you're going to have a leak.\
\
[00:12:24.990] - Doreen\
If you've got one of these that isn't working, you've got a leak in your marketing plan and you're not going to be getting the traction that you want to see. So let's start with attract.\
\
[00:12:33.390] - Doreen\
The number of platforms that we have access to is honestly ridiculous. It's ridiculous.\
\
[00:12:40.650] - Doreen\
And I totally get that not showing up on all of the platforms can really feel like leaving money on the table. Like it's, it's just there's so many opportunities. Why would you not take them? All right. So, but I will say, knowing what's even a bigger bummer is diffusing your efforts over the whole Internet and not getting any traction whatsoever. You know, it's just it's incredibly time consuming. It takes a ton of energy. And honestly, most of us don't have the bandwidth to show up well on more than one or two platforms at most.\
\
[00:13:10.740] - Doreen\
So for this part, I would say one strategy or platform for this part is great. And a really good place to start is to look at the past year or two, depending on how long that you've been in business, and see where all of your favorite clients are finding you. So the people that you really love to work with, the people that you really connect with, where are they finding you and how can you lean into that a little bit more?\
\
[00:13:33.450] - Doreen\
Because if you've got, if you've got a faucet that's already flowing, you want to crank that up. So if one of these is already working for you, crank it up like there's no need to reinvent the wheel.\
\
[00:13:43.470] - Doreen\
Networking and relationship building should always be at the heart of your marketing strategy. So this is where a lot of that comes in. Then you also want to look at what you're good at. So whether it's writing, whether it's video, voice, Podcast, things like that, you need to lean into your personal strengths to attract people to your brand. It's much more sustainable if you just lean into what you're good at. So what of these are you good at?\
\
[00:14:08.010] - Doreen\
What's something that you can see yourself doing sustainably over the long term? Just, you know, put a little check or jot down something that might work for you, for your strategy, and we'll pull all the pieces together later.\
\
[00:14:19.560] - Doreen\
So that's it for the attract one. And also, this isn't like a complete list. There's a million things that you can do to attract people to your brand that aren't listed here. This is just some of the really common ones. Yeah. So if there's something else where people are, where are people discovering you? That's what we're looking at here. Then once they've discovered you, obviously we have to go through to the next hoop, which is nurture.\
\
[00:14:42.460] - Doreen\
So this is what a lot of us think of when we think about marketing. So this is social media, email marketing, all that kind of stuff. Again, don't feel like you have to show up on every single platform, because that's going to that's going to diffuse your efforts too much. And you're not going to be effective on the platforms that you do want to show up on. Another quick note on this is to not just show up when you need work.\
\
[00:15:03.290] - Doreen\
So consistency is what's going to get you out of the feast or famine cycle. I'm sure you've heard this before. This is not news. I'm not going to dwell on it. But I will say consistency is what equals trust, but also know that consistent and constant are not the same word. Right. So consistently doesn't mean constantly. So you want to create a schedule that's sustainable for you. So, you know, if that looks like showing up two or three times a week, show up two or three times a week. If that looks like showing up five to seven times a week, do that like do what works for you over the long term.\
\
[00:15:37.810] - Doreen\
Because what we want to get away from is showing up, you know, seven times for two weeks and then dropping off the face of the planet to recover for a month and then doing the whole thing again. We want to get away from that. So look at what's consistent and what's sustainable, not what's constant. I am going to share some content ideas with you coming up. But I just if you're struggling with being consistent, I wish I had a magic pill because I would be a billionaire.\
\
[00:16:05.110] - Doreen\
There is no magic pill. You need to just schedule it and commit. If you're serious about your business, you will be serious about your marketing. Sales are the lifeblood of your business. And if you're not prioritizing your marketing, you're not going to be getting a steady flow of leads and that's just not going to end well. So you're a business owner. You're in this for real. Make sure that it's a priority because that's that's what your business is.\
\
[00:16:26.100] - Doreen\
So it either is going to take from you time, or it's going to cost you money, like just a little bit of tough love. Like, that's just that's how it works. But this is also what keeps your business going. So I can't emphasize enough how important it is.\
\
[00:16:40.000] - Doreen\
OK, so let's talk about what you can talk about. This might make things a little bit easier and get the juices flowing.\
\
[00:16:46.900] - Doreen\
So first thing, so then let's say you chosen your social media platform or platforms that you're going to show up on, but you're like, I don't know what to write. I don't know what to say, you know, all that kind of stuff. So let's jump into that. So the first question that you want to answer is, what do you have to offer? So go back to your goals that we did at the very beginning.\
\
[00:17:05.980] - Doreen\
What you want to do is you want to observe and serve your perfect fit person. So, you know, just all you want to do is serve the difference between showing up just to show up and showing up to serve is night and day like you're going to feel this instantly. So really just. What does their day look like? How can you help them out? How can you give them a quick win? How can you be in their life?\
\
[00:17:31.980] - Doreen\
How can you apply what's happening in your life to their life? Like, what do you, what do you have to offer? How can you help that person? So a couple of things about that. Your content does have to be connected to your offer if you want to make any sale. So you don't want to just be helping them with all the random things in their life, like somehow connect it back to your offer if and when you can. And the other thing is we also need to know how to hire you, like it needs to be crystal clear on your social media profiles, like how how does it work to work with you?\
\
[00:18:02.380] - Doreen\
What can we, what can we do with you? How can we collaborate with you? How can we purchase from you? Whatever that is? We need to know what that is. And you need to be very enthusiastic about it, because if you're not enthusiastic about it, nobody else is going to be enthusiastic about it either. So don't be shy. You're here to serve, like, whether that's a pay product or something that you're offering for free as far as, like, information or value.\
\
[00:18:23.410] - Doreen\
Either way, you're serving your client. So, yeah, it's really not that big of a deal to sell something because it's in place of service. Right. Second thing, be helpful without expecting anything in return. So, again, just kind of reiterating think about who you want to work with and answer the questions that they might have around the topics that your offer serves or solves. Really just to be helpful, it doesn't have to be more complicated than that.\
\
[00:18:52.990] - Doreen\
So you want to make sure that your audience has their ears perk for your content. And the way to do that is to be a valuable resource. So what frustrations are they experiencing on a daily basis? Like what does their day look like? How can you make their day with a quick win? Another thing that you can address here is what do they feel guilty about? This is a really big one. What are they kind of feeling gross about?\
\
[00:19:16.150] - Doreen\
How can you encourage them in that, you know empathize with them? You don't have to be patronizing, but let them know like you have been there or you know, I know that, how this feels, like, how what ,what do you do about it? Turn it around. I read somewhere quite a while ago and it really always stuck with you. And that's that people will do anything for those that encourage their dreams, justify their failures and allay their fears. And I think that's very true. So make sure that you're weaving that into your content as well.\
\
[00:19:43.000] - Doreen\
And then the third thing that you want to do is what is the aspirational lifestyle of your perfect client? So if this person purchased from you, what could their life look like, like cast a vision for their future? How much easier how much are you going to save them? Time or money or frustration? What's that going to look like? So basically, all of this in a nutshell, what you're talking about is really the problem that you're solving, the solution.\
\
[00:20:07.870] - Doreen\
You're presenting yourself as the solution and then the result of working with you. So you want to position your client as the hero, not yourself. I know this can be really tricky to do, but you are the guide.\
\
[00:20:18.610] - Doreen\
So so if you want to dig into this a little bit more, Donald Miller of building a story brand does this so well. His content is gold, but basically this is what it is. So a character has a problem. So the character, the main character, it's not you, it's your perfect fit client. So a character is a problem. But then he meets a guy that is you who gives them a plan, which is your offer calls them to action, which helps them avoid failure and ends in success.\
\
[00:20:45.970] - Doreen\
So these are the elements that you want in the content that you're creating. And it's going to work really easily when you answer the questions that we've just talked about. So quick review. You've got a strategy to attract people to your brand and now you're nurturing those relationships with all of this stuff that we just talked about. So nurture equals trust and trust equals dollars in your jeans. So that's what we want to do. So you have some really good stuff, like you could take this stuff that we've already covered and you'd be like, you have a lot to work with and you could be very effective, but let's kick it up a notch.\
\
[00:21:20.980] - Doreen\
This is 2020, 2021. There's a million people out there doing the same thing as you like, we know we're all working in a very saturated market. You know, they can rip off your color palette, they can copy your style. They can cut and paste your offer into their own. It's not ideal, but this is just reality. The one thing that they can't do is be you. So you need to use that.\
\
[00:21:44.890] - Doreen\
I have to sneeze. So who.... I think it's OK anyways.\
\
[00:21:52.540] - Doreen\
Your personality is your competitive advantage. So you want to use that. This is where the magic happens. So when it comes to posting personal content, I know that this can be tricky. Everybody has a different threshold for what they're comfortable with. You know, I'm personally quite a private person. I don't want to share a lot about my life, but I know how important it is that my personality is reflected in my brand. So for me, it comes down to sharing a lot about just a little bit of stuff.\
\
[00:22:19.780] - Doreen\
So I'm fueled by compliments. I'm a goal and productivity nerd. I love books. I have eight siblings. You know, there's just like a handful of things that I touch on frequently. And it's top of mind when people do think of productivity or goals or books or any of those things, or big fam... you know, then I'm I'm what pops into their head. So that's kind of what we do. It's only a few things. Obviously, there's a lot more to me, but those are just a few things that I'll share frequently.\
\
[00:22:46.510] - Doreen\
So that that's kind of makes it a little bit more sticky. Also, I will say, do not second guess this stuff like you can be very hard to be like these are the five things or whatever. A lot of it can come down to just showing your personality. And like, "I just have to sneeze." I could have rerecorded this entire video for it, but it's honestly not that big of a deal. I've also been on Instagram stories and laughed hysterically at my own dumb joke, which probably wasn't even that funny.\
\
[00:23:15.220] - Doreen\
That's the stuff that gets the most, like that, so.... It just, it just really lets your personality shine and it's important to just be your quirky little self. So you're going to, when you, when you do that and you hit publish anyways on that stuff. And I know like, it's easy to second guess it, but just hit publish on it anyways and you will see way better engagement. You'll see that attracting more people that are really similar to you, you know, that appreciate the same dad jokes as you tell or whatever that might be.\
\
[00:23:43.690] - Doreen\
So it's actually really good for your brand to just let that stuff fly. I don't know. Sounds bad, but you're not as unique as you think. Like we all, all of that stuff that you feel insecured about, can't even talk, all the dumb stuff that you feel insecure about. We probably do, too. So it's good to just let that out a little bit. You don't have to leave it all on the table. But definitely, you know, if there's the odd moment or whatever, whatever you're comfortable with, definitely not even whatever you're comfortable with, whatever you're a little bit uncomfortable with, let it fly.\
\
[00:24:14.050] - Doreen\
It's OK. It's really good to let that stuff be in there.\
\
[00:24:17.710] - Doreen\
So once you've done that, then you want to invite...\
\
[00:24:22.770] - Doreen\
Invite your audience into the sale, right? So you've you've attracted them to your brand, you've nurtured that relationship, it's very easy to just kind of get stuck there like it's very comfortable asking for sale can be difficult. I know that there can be a lot of head trash around that, too. But if you get stuck in the nurture phase, that's a recipe for social media burnout because you're not going to be getting the results that you want to see.\
\
[00:24:44.880] - Doreen\
So first of all, you need to make it abundantly clear what you do and for whom. Like, what's your elevator pitch like? For us, it's uncomplicate your marketing so you can get seen, get heard and get results. So, you know, if we're here, if you're on account, that's what we're here for. So everything that we offer, that's what it's for. And then this changes throughout, like our Instagram bio doesn't say that, but that's that's the underlying thing, the mission that's underneath everything.\
\
[00:25:12.630] - Doreen\
And then how we do that, that's really let me just see her. So right now, our Instagram bio, this is our offer. So our offer is the social media toolbox and it's here. Never worry about what to post on social media again, juicy story ideas, caption templates and simple strategies right here. And that's what it is. Like, that's how you can work with us right now. The only way to work with us right now, it's super clear.\
\
[00:25:36.630] - Doreen\
We're super excited about it. We're asking people to take the next step in working with us and they don't have to guess like it is not your readers job to figure that out. They're going to burn calories. They're just going to leave. So make sure that it's really, really clear. And then the second part of that is making sure that the process of purchasing is as easy and seamless as possible. So don't make your checkout process really hard.\
\
[00:25:57.720] - Doreen\
This is, you know, the twenty first century.\
\
[00:26:01.140] - Doreen\
You don't want to you know, the Internet's been around for a while. Make your check out online and digital, especially after 2020. Everything has moved online and it's not going anywhere. So make sure that it's really easy and seamless. And then also, like, you know, at the end of your post or anything like that, you don't have to call your audience to purchase from you on every post, but definitely make sure that it's really clear that you do want them to work with you.\
\
[00:26:25.200] - Doreen\
Because like I said earlier, if you want to talk about it, they sure as heck aren't going to be either. So that's what we want to do. Then the last part of the thing is going to be to the last part of the thing I found so legit and professional. The last part of your marketing plan is to delight. So we talked about this at the very beginning. The best marketing strategy that you can ever have is to care.\
\
[00:26:47.130] - Doreen\
Referrals are the holy grail of marketing and the absolute best way to grow your business. So when you surprise and delight your customers on the other side of a purchase, they will be shouting your name for the, from the rooftops. And this is going to get you further than one hundred social media posts, no matter how well crafted they are. So if you think about all of the stuff that we covered, like we've talked about attact, nurture, invite and delight, the order of priority as you're building your marketing plan is actually the reverse of the order that the customer journey actually proceedes.\
\
[00:27:16.350] - Doreen\
And so not to make this very confusing, you do want to hit every step. But if you're like, well, this is a lot. I know it's a lot to chew off and we don't expect you to have everything. One hundred percent like this is always going to be evolving. This is like a living, breathing plan that's going to change as your business changes. But you're going to notice like maybe a leak in your attract strategy. Like you're you're not growing your audience as quickly as you would like to for your goals or something like that.\
\
[00:27:47.250] - Doreen\
Or maybe you've noticed, like you're growing your audience, but you're not really converting them into a sale. So maybe your invite strategy, maybe your nurture strategy, like look at the portions that need a little bit of work. But if you're just looking at straight up priority, you want to work backwards. So first delight, like we talked about your customer experience is the most important thing. That's the first priority. Then once you know that you have a handle on that, then you could talk about nurture and invite.\
\
[00:28:14.490] - Doreen\
Right. So those kind of go hand in hand.\
\
[00:28:16.140] - Doreen\
They go together. But we're not going to worry about attracting new people to your brand until you know how to work with the people that are already there.\
\
[00:28:25.290] - Doreen\
So don't worry about building your audience. If you've got one hundred people in your audience and you really know how to nurture and invite those hundred people, you're going to get a lot more traction. We've seen it firsthand. Accounts that have ten thousand followers are not doing as well as the teeny tiny accounts. So you don't need a big audience to be successful. Definitely look at delight and then look at nurture and invite and really get a handle on that.\
\
[00:28:46.560] - Doreen\
Once you have that, then you can work on attracting new people into your brand. So that's really what's going to amplify your effort at the end of the day, right? Don't lean a lot of energy into attract until you've got a good handle on the other stuff. So don't start with one hundred things. Start with one thing. I know this can be very hard. I remind myself all the time, like it doesn't all have to happen today, one thing at a time, you know, it's just going to make you that much more effective when you really focus on one thing versus a million.\
\
[00:29:18.210] - Doreen\
So really delight first, then nurture and invite and then attract new people to your brand. It's going to amplify so, so good. That's really it for as far as a marketing plan goes, I know I just threw a lot of information at you guys. If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me. You can send me an email, you can find me online, knapcreative.ca you can peek my social media, my Instagram.\
\
[00:29:40.580] - Doreen\
I'm there all the time. I love chatting, so definitely hit me up there. If you have any questions. We're always happy to help. And if you like this and you feel like you want a little bit more, definitely Instagram is where's that. So Instagram.com/knap.creative and that's really it for me today. So we'll see you on the other side. And good luck with your marketing.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.430] - Doreen\
Hey. Hi. Hello. Are you someone who procrastinates until the very last second, you're launching a digital product or you're creating a digital product. But the launch date keeps getting pushed back again and again because, you know, you keep on thinking of more things that you can add or pieces that you can rerecord.\
\
[00:00:27.450] - Doreen\
Or maybe there's stuff that you want to take out of it, like there's so much things that you could change and make it so much better, right? Never mind actually selling the same. You know, that you have to schedule the Instagram post or the newsletter, whatever it might be, but you're going to hold off until the very last second, like you have a draft there, but it's going to need some tweaking. So, you're just going to hold off and wait.\
\
[00:00:45.100] - Doreen\
You're holding off because you know that you're going to want to tweak it before you hit publish, and maybe in the end it never gets published. That happens. So, before I get carried away. Let me introduce myself. I'm Doreen.\
\
[00:00:57.450] - Doreen\
I'm the heart and soul behind Knap Creative, and I'm here to be your voice of reason in all the small business and social media sheds. And today, I'm going to give you perfectionism a little kick in the pants. Hopefully that helps, and help you get on the right track with consistency. Okay, so I get it. I wouldn't necessarily call myself a perfectionist, but I definitely would say that I have high standards, and I don't know, is there a difference between those two things.\
\
[00:01:19.820] - Doreen\
I don't know. It's debatable. So, right now I'm guessing that you are in the planning phase, right? Like you're here, you are gathering up all the information and doing all the research to make sure that your product is freaking awesome, which, high fives, you should be doing that. That's absolutely what you need to be doing.\
\
[00:01:34.320] - Doreen\
But here's the thing. You don't want to get stuck in that spot, and that is way too easy to do. 100%. I've done that. It's very fun to plan things.\
\
[00:01:43.240] - Doreen\
It's a lot less fun and a lot more scary to actually put them out into the world. Right? I totally get it if you're anything like me you know, free summit. Yes. Sign me up. 100%.\
\
[00:01:53.280] - Doreen\
You're here. Podcast out the wizard. Your secret Pinterest is seeing a lot of action. You've got mountains of notebooks. You're pushing your kids because you're trying to think and you're scoping out how everybody else is doing it, picking up what you can, spinning your own magic into it and trying to make it the best that it could possibly, possibly ever be.\
\
[00:02:10.250] - Doreen\
Right. I know the trail. I also know that once you dig in and you start planning, which is very fun. You're also going to start getting targeted with ads from other people who are trying to do the same thing as you. Right.\
\
[00:02:21.380] - Doreen\
And chances are, if they're running ads. These are people that have been doing it for you know a lot longer than you have if they're doing it right? Absolutely. It means that they've been doing it longer than you have. So, yeah.\
\
[00:02:31.720] - Doreen\
Sometimes their stuff is pretty awesome, and sometimes that can get you in a head space. That is not that fun, and it's not helpful for someone who already has high standards. That's what going to call perfection, because it's way nicer.\
\
[00:02:44.790] - Doreen\
But let's take a step back and just think about this for a second. So, this is a question that I ask myself all the time. How ridiculous is it that you are trying to make a thing that is better than all of the other things combined on your first try? That's pretty stinking ridiculous. Right.\
\
[00:03:01.510] - Doreen\
Between where you are now and where you want to be, there is a mountain of imperfect work absolutely. The people that you're looking at, the people that are running those ads, the people whose stuff that you're poking around and looking through. Those people didn't get there in one single giant lead, like they didn't start at the bottom and be like, okay now and then end up, you know, this, logically, you know this, right?\
\
[00:03:19.540] - Doreen\
They started exactly where you are, like, zero followers, $0.00 sales. Zero. Of all the things, I just went back and I looked at my goals from 2019, which was fine. By the way, if you have time to do this, do it for sure. Keep track of your goals and keep it in a file so that you can always look back because it's really fun to see that's a good way to see progress, because sometimes it can be hard to see the progress.\
\
[00:03:41.330] - Doreen\
But I looked at my goals. Making a consistent $5,000 a month was a stretch goal where I was like, I want to be making that every month, and it was really just like I couldn't really wrap my brain. I was trying to figure out a way to make it happen, and it was difficult. So, at that time, I was launching a program called Thrive that was my first attempt at kind of like a mentorship/course. That was my first digital product, honestly, and it wasn't terrible.\
\
[00:04:07.170] - Doreen\
I feel good about what I did at the time. I sold a few, I ran through. It was fine. It wasn't terrible. But also if I did it now, it would be so different.\
\
[00:04:16.180] - Doreen\
And it would be so much better. Because I did the first sucky round, like, I wouldn't be here today because without having done the crappy first round and I'm not going to get to where I want to be because trust me, I have not even come remotely close to making it yet by not doing the middle stuff, right. It's a journey for sure. So, I did the first sucky round. Now I'm doing less sucky rounds and there's always room for improvement, right? Always, always, always, and then just keep showing up.\
\
[00:04:47.300] - Doreen\
So, do the first one. Keep showing up, keep showing up. Doing the thing is what makes you get really good at the thing. That's the only way. What did they say?\
\
[00:04:55.500] - Doreen\
I read this summit recently and it was so true. You can't learn how to swim by reading a brochure about swimming, like you can learn the motions or whatever. But until you actually get in the water, you're not going to know how to swim. So, same with everything that you're trying to do in your digital products and in your business, like you have to be doing the thing in order to learn how to do the thing. And it's messy.\
\
[00:05:14.830] - Doreen\
It's really uncomfortable. But with that being said, get busy. If you do one thing, if you take one thing away from this whole training, set yourself some deadlines, make yourself accountable and commit to it. Like putting it out there, whether it's creating your first product or whether it's iterating on that product. Like maybe you've created one and you want to make it better.\
\
[00:05:34.780] - Doreen\
Definitely. Set yourself a deadline, make yourself accountable and commit to it. Or even if it's, like you have the product, that part is done and you want to show up on social media to sell that product, same thing. Set a deadline, commit to it and make yourself accountable. Just make it happen. Here's a spoiler for you.\
\
[00:05:52.170] - Doreen\
Even if you spend 1000 years at an awesome summit like this one, your stuff is not going to be perfect. And even if you spend 1000 years making that product, it's still not going to be perfect. I know that you know this, but you've got to get the crappy ones out of the way to get to the really good ones, and it's going to be uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable that my camera just did this. I want to start this over.\
\
[00:06:09.620] - Doreen\
Am I going to do it? No, this hopefully is useful, even though it's not perfect. So, yeah, it's really the only way to do that, so.\
\
[00:06:17.830] - Doreen\
I know. I hear you if you're saying, oh, you know what? I'm not quite clear on my Perfect Fit client because I know the messaging out there is so noisy around this, you accidentally maybe wore your hair down on one video and then you put it up on another video and you want it to be really consistent across the boards. And I have to refund the whole thing. Or maybe you just ran across a PDF that's, like, so much nicer than anything that you've put out there.\
\
[00:06:38.080] - Doreen\
And you're kind of lowkey, like thinking maybe you should rebrand it a little bit like it's not out there. It's not doing. You can still do that, right? No, quit it. Don't do that.\
\
[00:06:47.730] - Doreen\
So, you will go on forever. If you're stuck in this spin, you will go on forever. Just put it out. So like I said, it doesn't have to be perfect to be useful. This is far from perfect.\
\
[00:06:57.340] - Doreen\
Hopefully it's still useful. This is a quote by Elizabeth Gilbert that always comes to mind when I'm thinking about it. I think I have this in my grid, and I should literally frame it and put it up on my desk. Perfectionism is just fear in fancy shoes and a mink coat. It's true.\
\
[00:07:12.620] - Doreen\
Perfectionism is just an excuse for not doing the thing you're getting in your own way. I know it's uncomfortable. I know it sucks. I know it's not like a great feeling, but it's good after. And that's how you're going to get to where you want to go.\
\
[00:07:22.570] - Doreen\
So, you have all the information that you need to put something pretty awesome out there. You probably have enough information just like honestly in your own notebook right here. Right? Like you have the information. So that's not what we're short on.\
\
[00:07:34.510] - Doreen\
You're here. You're learning the thing, you're getting, the information you're taking it in. Hopefully, you're taking some notes. That's awesome. But you don't need more information.\
\
[00:07:42.610] - Doreen\
What you do need is you need to take action. That's the part that's missing, not the information, the action is what's missing. Let's say that you've gotten an iteration or two of your product out of the way and you need to get consistent about actually selling it. Let's tackle that part next.\
\
[00:07:57.180] - Doreen\
So, I'm going to address Instagram land. First of all, it's my happy place. I've seen some really good results there, so I feel like I can stick into it absolutely. And second, most of us are hanging out there, right?\
\
[00:08:08.300] - Doreen\
Like that's where we're at right now. This stuff applies across the board, though, like if you're in Facebook groups or if you're on LinkedIn or Twitter, whatever your platform is, or if you're watching this in the future and it's a different platform, this stuff still applies across the board. It's just going to look a little bit different depending on the context, but the principles are the same. So, Instagram is noisy here. You have to do reals. You have to do stories you have to post in the grid.\
\
[00:08:32.170] - Doreen\
You haven't even thought about lives or guides or any of that stuff, but it really does feel like you're leaving opportunity on the table if you're not using all of the pieces, right? No, you're not. I will say you are not leaving opportunity on the table. It feels like you are. I know the messaging, like I get blasted with the exact same stuff as you do.\
\
[00:08:49.740] - Doreen\
It's a lot. It's a lot.\
\
[00:08:52.830] - Doreen\
I'm not saying that all of those things aren't awesome because they are. They're all awesome. But here's the thing. You don't learn how to juggle by throwing templates into the air all at once. You're not going to throw them all up and be like, okay, cool.\
\
[00:09:02.580] - Doreen\
Let's go. It's not going to end well for you. You want to get a handle on one plate or one layer, and then you want to add another one, right? You're going to take it just a little step at a time. So, Instagram, specifically, the order of importance to the layers that I'm talking about are the plates when it comes to actually selling your product, because I want to talk about selling because you can create the product and you can put it out there and you can build the audience and you can do all the stuff.\
\
[00:09:26.110] - Doreen\
But until you're actually getting dollars into your pockets, what are you doing? This is a business. You want to make some money, right. The first stories I want you to do a fair amount of stories. Second of all, the grid, a little bit of the grid, and then third, reels, whatever you can handle sustainably.\
\
[00:09:43.190] - Doreen\
And we're going to dig into each of those one at a time and make them really easy to pick up and really doable for everybody. So, first, before we do that, I want to take a step back and I want to talk about, we talked about consistency, right. Consistency is in the title. You pick this up because you want to show consistently. That's the message.\
\
[00:09:58.490] - Doreen\
Right? Like you need to show up consistently. And usually that's taken to mean you need to be showing up frequently or often. But consistency does not mean that you have to be there seven days a week. It doesn't mean you have to be there five days a week.\
\
[00:10:11.960] - Doreen\
Even consistency is whatever you can handle in this season of life that you're in for an extended period of time. Right. So, maybe that is every day. Maybe right now, you have a lot of bandwidth, you have a lot of time, you have a lot of energy, which I'm so jealous. And that means that you can show up every single day.\
\
[00:10:28.250] - Doreen\
Awesome. High fives. Do it. But maybe it means that you can only show up two days a week. What we want to get away from here is showing up frequently for a week, you know five times, you have a week, you're feeling it, you're in the flow. You're creating a ton of content.\
\
[00:10:44.700] - Doreen\
You're showing up consistently, and then the next week or the next month, you fall off the faces of the planet. That's what we want to get away from. So anything that you can handle consistently. So, if you're feeling it that week and you want to create a ton of content, create it and just like, schedule it out in advance. So, you're still showing up two or three times a week, but just for more weeks, if that makes any sense.\
\
[00:11:03.370] - Doreen\
So, whatever that looks like for you, I want you to sit down. And I'm not telling you to do a lot of homework on this, actually. But one thing that I do want you to do is for stories, the grid and reals. What is that number for you? How many times per week are you committed to showing up on your Instagram or whatever the platform is for you.\
\
[00:11:23.200] - Doreen\
Right? Like, if it's not Instagram, for something else, definitely just commit to whatever that looks like for you, the frequency, then the other side of consistency. So, when we think of consistency, it's frequency, but also clarity. Right? Like when someone knows what to expect when they land on your stuff, that's consistent because you're talking about the same thing all the time.\
\
[00:11:41.850] - Doreen\
If you don't feel like you're repeating yourself, you're not being consistent enough. And I also know, like I said, the messaging and especially for young business owners. And I say that you can be 100 years old and just starting a new business and that's a young business owner. So, someone who's just kind of newish, the advice that you hear is to find your niche or to niche down and same thing. Like, be clear, talk about the same thing.\
\
[00:12:03.960] - Doreen\
But the reality is you're not going to get there by not doing it same thing. You got to take it one step at a time. If you're second guessing that foundational stuff and getting stuck in the plan, that's where you get stuck in the planning phase, right where they're like, oh, you have to niche down. So, you're sitting here stewing about what your niche might be and not doing the actual work, like working is going to get you the niche. If that makes any sense, like, you just have to show up and you just have to do the thing.\
\
[00:12:30.620] - Doreen\
And I would say, like, a couple of years, it can take quite a significant amount of time. I know that I can niche down more. I also know that I have a thriving, successful business without niching down as much as people are telling me to niche down because I'm doing something that works for me. So, do what feels really good for you. If you struggle, I'm not going to go too far down the rabbit hole.\
\
[00:12:50.010] - Doreen\
Now, I feel like this is a whole other tangent that I want to go on, but I'll try to stay focused. You are your brand. So, if you find yourself having a really hard time, niching down or you're interested in a whole bunch of things, then you are the brand. You have to really brand yourself. So that's like, my quick word of advice on that.\
\
[00:13:04.640] - Doreen\
Follow me on social media and talk to me there. If you have any questions about that stuff, because I will no doubt clearly any time. Yeah. So, don't get stuck in the planning phase of this. Like if you don't feel totally sure on some of those foundational things, move ahead anyways.\
\
[00:13:19.030] - Doreen\
Do the thing. Anyways, doing the work is going to get you the clarity, right. So that's that side of consistency. Alright. So, let's talk about stories.\
\
[00:13:29.200] - Doreen\
That was one of the layers that I wanted to cover. So, stories are my favorite part of Instagram, honestly. They are magic when it comes to selling on Instagram. I would not be standing here where I am today without having showed up on Instagram stories. And I know it feels super dumb to hold up your phone and talk at it.\
\
[00:13:49.470] - Doreen\
It feels so dumb. I agree. I still feel dumb to this day. You might have to do a few takes at first, but generally speaking, it's the easiest content to create. It's the quickest and also it's going to get you the most connections and the most sales for sure, so that I know for sure.\
\
[00:14:04.340] - Doreen\
I also know you're going to get better at it if you practice. I know that comes as a real surprise. Second of all, it's made me a pretty hefty chunk of money, so I'm going to keep doing it you know, and better than that. I've also made some real sole connections through showing up on Instagram stories, and that's without showing up very vulnerable. I know what the narratives are, where it's like you have to be authentic and all the buzzwords and all the things like I show up in a work capacity.\
\
[00:14:32.670] - Doreen\
And still, I have made some really solid awesome connections so you don't have to get super uncomfortable. You draw your own line of what your boundaries are. Again, another conversation for another day. So, here's what you need to do to get consistent with your stories. \
\
[00:14:48.060] - Doreen\
Again, I know that I said this already, but I'm just going to remind you practice makes better and also scheduling right? So, consistency doesn't mean constantly. It's scheduling out something that's going to work for you. So for me right now that looks like taking Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday all off. I don't show up on stories most weeks on those days, but I do show up consistently Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as much as I can.\
\
[00:15:08.630] - Doreen\
So that's the first part second part is maybe you do have the time and you can schedule it in and all of that is fine. But you open up your phone to post a story and then you feel like, who cares about my life or what do I even talk about those kind of questions? Totally understandable, 100% been there. So, first thing always always share behind the scenes enthusiasm and frustrations that you're feeling as you're developing your offers. So, whatever your product is as you're creating it.\
\
[00:15:36.040] - Doreen\
I know this can feel messy, but share when you're really excited about something and you're working on it behind the scenes and it's feeling so good or when it's not going as well as you want.\
\
[00:15:45.070] - Doreen\
People love this stuff. They want to be along for the ride, that's part of the story. So, it happens automatically. You don't have to figure out your story first and then do it. You just document stuff as it's happening and that turns into your story.\
\
[00:15:56.040] - Doreen\
So that's the first part. Second, whenever you get a kind word or testimonial or review or anything messages about your product, share that too. Like share it as you go. Those two things alone are going to get dollars into your Jeep. So behind the scenes enthusiasm and frustrations and testimonials social proof, kind words, all that kind of stuff. So, second of all, you got a freebie with this presentation.\
\
[00:16:18.870] - Doreen\
Follow those prompts in there. Those story prompts are designed to spark conversations. They are designed to help you build trust with your audience, and they are designed to help you sell stuff. So, myself there, sell stuff. So, if you try that and you do like it, sign up for the toolbox because you will get those prompts right in your Instagram every single day.\
\
[00:16:38.510] - Doreen\
And legit. So, many people that are in the toolbox are like, this is my favorite part. That's the best part of the toolbox. So, definitely, if you like it, you can get more of it for sure. So that's it for story.\
\
[00:16:50.840] - Doreen\
Then let's talk about the grid. So, I said less on the grid. What did I say to the grid in the beginning? Like, lots of stories and kind of show up on the grid. You don't want to neglect it all together, but also don't stress it.\
\
[00:17:01.540] - Doreen\
If you can only do a couple of posts per week, like that's enough. That's all we're doing. If you neglect it, your stats are going to drop off the face of the map. We've also tried that because I love stories, and I'm like, well, this is not enough in reals, right? We're going to address that later, but reals.\
\
[00:17:18.210] - Doreen\
So, I'm like, if I just do the video parts, can I just leave the grid? No, it turns out you can't just leave the grid. So, you'll do better if you do post a few posts on the grid per week. And then same thing, if you're not sure what to post before somebody hits follow on your account, they're going to scroll past the first few post to see kind of like what you're all about. Like they're going to check your stories and they're going to look at your bio and they're going to look at your first few posts, so make sure that you're kind of looping content.\
\
[00:17:40.540] - Doreen\
That's going to answer the questions that they're going to have going in. Right. So, you want to talk about you. You definitely want to have pictures of your face in there as much as possible. Why you're doing, what you're doing, that kind of stuff, stuff that you value in your business that don't be dry and like, corporate about it.\
\
[00:17:54.280] - Doreen\
But talk about it that's important. People need to know with that and they connect with that. Right? That's a small business. That's why people buy from us.\
\
[00:18:02.050] - Doreen\
Second, personal insights or encouragement is something that you can do. Giving permission to people to be who they are and where they are right now in the messy middle you know, and encouraging them that they can make it to the other side. They can achieve their goals, whatever it has to be relevant obviously to your product, but personal insights, encouragement works really well too. Helpful content, so this is stuff that people are going to want to save.\
\
[00:18:25.010] - Doreen\
Right. So you want to be sharing tutorials or hacks or trainings or things like that. The question that I always ask for this is like, what can someone do today in two minutes or less? That's relevant to my niche, that they can turn around and apply and make their day better tomorrow. So, what's one thing I can do tonight to make my day better tomorrow?\
\
[00:18:43.070] - Doreen\
That's what you can put in there. It doesn't have to be rocket science. Don't overthink it like this can be so, so, simple. And honestly, the simpler the better. So, don't make it complicated where it doesn't need to be.\
\
[00:18:54.250] - Doreen\
Fourth thing is showcasing your product or service, obviously. And fifth benefits of working with you. Like, what are they going to get out of it? So, people are really, all of this camera, people are really just like what's in it for me, you need to be sharing that stuff in your grid. So, they're going to be scrolling past those first few posts and they're going to be wanting to see all of those things.\
\
[00:19:12.730] - Doreen\
So, again, the toolbox has all of this stuff in it and so many more things honestly. So, if you're stuck on writing captions, definitely grab it. The templates in there are so juicy. Honestly, I'll just sit here and brag, but they're better than anything else that I've seen.\
\
[00:19:30.040] - Doreen\
So, they will sound just like you, but they're also strategic and not just fluff. Right? Okay. So that's it for the grid. So, we've covered stories.\
\
[00:19:37.740] - Doreen\
We've covered the grid. Let's talk about reels.\
\
[00:19:42.270] - Doreen\
Oh, reels. I have a love-hate relationship with reals. I'll tell you that right now. So question should you be doing reals? Right? Everybody is asking, should I be doing real?\
\
[00:19:49.930] - Doreen\
I don't know. Maybe, it depends. So, first of all, question, do you have a handle on your grid and your stories? If not, don't. You want to reach more people. I mean, if yes, let's carry on to the next question.\
\
[00:20:02.950] - Doreen\
I should clarify that. So, do you have a handle on your grid and your stories? If not, don't even worry about this part. If yes, do you want to reach more people?\
\
[00:20:10.570] - Doreen\
That is the way that I should have phrased that. So, if yes, then give them a whirl. Definitely worth a try. So, do you have to point and ask and do silly lip dubs? No, you absolutely don't.\
\
[00:20:22.730] - Doreen\
I opposite of recommend that, what's the opposite of recommending? Because that's what I do about that. So, please do not hesitate. I'm going to share a link here as well to Sidney Raz is the name of the account, SIDNEY RAZ on Instagram, and he takes it way back down to the basics.\
\
[00:20:39.250] - Doreen\
You might have seen him. It's like things that I wish I knew before I was 30. So, easy, right? Like, he's niche down, and he's helpful that's it.\
\
[00:20:46.400] - Doreen\
His reels are goals, highly recommend. So that is what I have been seeing, working really well on Instagram. It's like Niching way down and then tightening up your theme for 30 to 90 days at a time. And I know that I talked earlier about not finding your niche until you were doing it for a couple of years or whatever that is. But I'm talking about a content, niche or theme.\
\
[00:21:07.370] - Doreen\
It is kind of a better word, I guess. So, think of a theme that you can focus on for, like, 30 to 90 days. You don't have to be married to this. It doesn't have to be forever. This is just like you can take a little piece of your business and just talk only about that so I could do this.\
\
[00:21:20.180] - Doreen\
So, I'm a social media manager, I guess. Trying to think of like, oh, what are all the titles again? Niching, right? I can talk about Instagram. So that's Niche down. I can also talk about Instagram stories.\
\
[00:21:32.940] - Doreen\
I can talk about Instagram stories for a whole month. I could. So, how much can you niche down your topic? Right. And just do that as much as you can. \
\
[00:21:40.980] - Doreen\
For products, it's a little bit trickier, but you have a digital product so that may make it easier. Yeah. What's a theme that you can focus on for a month? And that is what makes Sidney's reels so good is that when you click on his account or literally any of his reels, you know what you're going to get from him? You know what to expect, right?\
\
[00:21:57.150] - Doreen\
So, we don't have time today, obviously. Like I said, I could talk about each of these separate parts of Instagram for an entire month. But in a nutshell, on reals, keep them bite sized, well, okay, not even bite size.\
\
[00:22:09.780] - Doreen\
Keep them nibble sized. Like if you have a regular post, like, if you have a post in the grid, that's three bullets. Your reel is like one of those bullets. It's so tiny. It's so bite size.\
\
[00:22:19.560] - Doreen\
Second, using trending sounds might help your real performance. Like, no lie. That's cool. It's probably going to reach a lot of people. But think about first of all, what is that going to do for your business?\
\
[00:22:32.260] - Doreen\
Right. So, keep that top of mind when you're doing this stuff, because this is where we get, lost in a spin of the reels where, yeah, it's fun to see, like, 10,000 or a million views. But what's it actually doing for you. And we've had reals going viral on client accounts. And it's like, first of all, keeping up with the comments is a whole thing.\
\
[00:22:50.880] - Doreen\
It's impossible. And then also they're getting a ton of new followers. And that's cool. That makes us look really good. Right?\
\
[00:22:56.660] - Doreen\
Like, through the account from 1000 to 5000 or whatever the numbers are, that's awesome. But what is it doing for their bottom line? Nothing ,like their local business. They need local followers. So, yeah.\
\
[00:23:10.430] - Doreen\
Keep in mind what you're actually trying to do on your reels. So, if you just want reach and you do have a digital product, so it's not necessarily local, but you know what I mean? Keep that in mind. Dancing and lift ups are not always the best idea. So, I always say, like using your voice and your words are the best way to make your brand really sticky.\
\
[00:23:29.710] - Doreen\
Regurgitating what 100 other people have done? I don't know, like I don't know. It can be fun. I'm not saying I haven't done it, but I'm also like, really keep in mind what you're trying to do with reels.\
\
[00:23:39.750] - Doreen\
And again, I could talk about this for a month, so we're not going to super get into it, but be careful. You want to basically the video part of it is almost like a headline, right where you're using it to grab someone's attention. That's the point of the actual reel itself. And then the caption is the juicy part where that's what people want to say or comment on. So that's kind of how to structure it if you are ready to dig into reels, but you're kind of stuck on ideas again.\
\
[00:24:03.060] - Doreen\
I know this is going to come as a surprise, subscribe to the toolbox. Yeah, there's real prompts in there, too, with explanations, and I get way more into detail on all the stuff that I've kind of skimmed over just right here. So, hopefully, the last few minutes have been helpful. So, to quickly recap what we've covered. Perfect is not a thing.\
\
[00:24:21.660] - Doreen\
Better is a thing. And you're going to get better by showing up. That's the only way. So, yeah, that's really it reminder. It does not have to be perfect to be useful. Do you want to help people or not?\
\
[00:24:32.540] - Doreen\
I'm guessing. Yeah, you want to help. So that's how you're going to help by imperfect action. Second, consistent is different than constant. So, set a schedule that works for you in your season of life and stick to that.\
\
[00:24:44.640] - Doreen\
Third, build out your marketing strategy one layer at a time. So, I know that there's a million people that are doing a million more things than you, and they're telling you to do a million things as well, but really cut the distractions. quit with the high key stuff, like seriously, not necessary. And start focusing your efforts on marketing that works for real humans with real life like you and me.\
\
[00:25:04.870] - Doreen\
So that's really it in a nutshell. The toolbox is a lifesaver. As I've mentioned a few times. It's there if you need it. Thanks so much for listening.\
\
[00:25:12.060] - Doreen\
I appreciate your time. I am so glad that you're here. And like I said before, information is 20%. So, hopefully, you took a million notes and kind of got the information side down. So, now let's make rubber hit the pavement.\
\
[00:25:24.490] - Doreen\
It is time for action.\

[00:00:13.430] - India\
Hi. Welcome to How to Use Video in Your Blog, the secrets to making your blog stand out by incorporating video. On today's agenda, we will be discussing the advantages of using video some shocking to six and of course, how to use video in your blog. But first, a little bit about me, I'm a wife, girl mom, and video marketing strategist. I empower creative entrepreneurs to show up confidently on camera, stand out and attract their ideal clients by creating a profitable video marketing blueprint for them.\
\
[00:00:49.410] - India\
But first, a little bit about me, I'm a wife, girl mom, and video marketing strategist. I empower creative entrepreneurs just like yourself to show confidently on camera, stand out and attract their ideal clients by creating a profitable video marketing blueprint for them. What does that even mean, India? That means that I'm your go to person when you're ready to grow your business using video.\
\
[00:01:15.720] - India\
Whether that's YouTube social media webinars updating the video on your website sales pages with video Pinterest. As you can see, the opportunities with video are limitless. Why should you incorporate video into your blog? First, it increases the time spent on your blog. Why does the time spent on your blog even matter?\
\
[00:01:40.110] - India\
It honestly shows a few things. The first is that it shows that your reader is engaged. It's proving that your content is resonating with them and that it's relevant. It helps you to reach new audiences. So, as you're creating video content, hopefully you are putting that video content on YouTube.\
\
[00:02:01.590] - India\
So, you're taking advantage of the SEO. So that kind of brings me into my third point. Search engines love video. Have you watched a YouTube video lately that's been timestamped?\
\
[00:02:12.370] - India\
If you look at that timestamp, it actually pops up on Google. Now I'm not sure when exactly that feature started. That's a really cool feature. So, if you're you know let's say you're doing a tutorial or unboxing and you put on there at such and such minute and second, that's automatically going to pop on Google.\
\
[00:02:33.060] - India\
That's pretty cool. Another reason why is that it establishes the like, know and trust factor faster. So, when someone sees you on camera, I always say this, but your energy is magnetic. When they see your face, they're like, wow, it's really a real person behind the person that's writing this blog. And then lastly, video in your blog helps you to outshine your competitor.\
\
[00:02:57.950] - India\
I'm pretty sure that your competitor is not taking advantage of using video in their blog. So, if someone is looking for exactly what you're writing about and you have video on your blog, that's just going to make them want to subscribe to your blog or keep writing your content to follow you on your social media accounts and everything else. It just makes you a better choice. So, let's talk about some shocking statistics because they really are shocking. Readers spent an average of 2.6 more time on blogs with video than those without. 72% of customers said that they would rather learn about a product or service by way of video.\
\
[00:03:48.810] - India\
One in four bloggers add video in their blog, so that goes back to outshining your competitor. Only one in four bloggers that's not a lot at all. Blogs with video are 50 times more likely to drive organic search traffic than plain text. Get rolling with video. So, how do you even get started with video?\
\
[00:04:12.250] - India\
How do you incorporate a video in a blog post? So, I have six ways that you can do this. The first way is a tutorial. This is my favorite. I think this will be the easiest for you to get started with.\

Let's say you are a mom blogger and you are showing how to put together a swing or stroller or some type of product instead of listing out the steps of how to do what it is, how to do what you're writing about. Shoot a quick video. It's so much more. I know if I came to a blog and I always do on Pinterest, I've seen a blog that had video showing me how to do it, I'm much more likely to continue watching and continue reading the blog. Another way to incorporate video into your blog are reviews.\
\
[00:05:06.670] - India\
So, if you are reviewing a product or service, testimonials and reviews on camera are so much more effective on video than it is just written, unboxing or halls. If you are a fashion blogger, this is great. Instead of showing a million pictures, you can actually show how the clothing fits. Another way is a Vlog. So, if you had a blog post about a day in the life, or you took a trip to the zoo with your kids, or whatever the blog post may be, you can just shoot the content, make it a 30 or 60 second video of a day in the life of what it is to you.\
\
[00:05:53.150] - India\
Or another way that you can incorporate video into your blog is by repurposing old blogs into new blogs. But this time adding video. Lastly, if you're just getting started with your blog, you can shoot a quick introduction. How great would that be if a reader is just stumbling across your block, instead of reading a two or three minute blog post, wouldn't it be nice to introduce yourself on camera? Let them know what your blog is going to be about how many times a week you post blogs, etcetera.\
\
[00:06:26.170] - India\
Like I said, it establishes that like no and trust factor so much faster with video. So that is all. Thank you so much for your attention today. I really hope that this resonated with you. I hope you walked away with some golden nuggets.\
\
[00:06:40.580] - India\
And if you are ready to take yours to the next level, I would love to work with you. You can learn how we can work together by visiting my website, indiabrown.com. Thank you so much. Take care.\

**Transcript:**\
Jenn Zellers [00:00:11]:\
Hey there. I am so excited that you are here to learn about how to create a sustainable marketing system through speaking and collaborations. So before we dive in, I do want to go ahead and define what a sustainable marketing system is. So we're gonna look at real quick overview before we get into all the details of it, what the main pieces of this sustainable marketing system are. And over here, we call those your visibility ecosystem. So the first ingredient is your seeds. You have to plant your seeds, which are your speaking and your collaboration opportunities. So those are gonna be things like speaking on guest podcasts, which we'll get into all of that kind of stuff in a few.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:00:49]:\
And then after you've planted those seeds, you need to nurture them because they do take some help to grow and to become those lovely little sprouts and seedlings that are going to grow into fruit for your business and your blog. And then the last thing is that growth, and that is where your visibility ecosystem, your sustainable marketing system really comes into play. Because it is going to allow you to start getting those speaking invites and those collaboration invites inbound instead of you having to go pitch yourself all the time. Alright. So now that we have that all defined, I just wanna introduce myself real quick. Hi. I'm Jenn. I'm a sustainable marketing strategist over at Visibility Ecosystem, where we create sustainable marketing systems for online business owners like you.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:01:36]:\
I'm also a dog mom. I've got 2 Australian Shepherds and love doing agility with them, and I'm also a dragon nerd. So if you have any really good fantasy or sci fi books, especially if they involve dragons, please send them my way because I need some new recommendations. Okay. Let's go ahead and dive right in now. So we're going to look at that first part of your visibility ecosystem. This is your seeds. This is where you're planting those seeds through speaking and collaborations.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:02:05]:\
So some examples of what your speaking opportunities might be would be guest podcasting, where where you go and you appear on someone else's podcast as a guest expert. You could be speaking at virtual summits, whether it's doing a presentation like I'm doing here, or you might end up going and doing a panel or an interview or whatever it happens to be for that particular summit, but you are appearing as guest expert there as well. And then there's just being a guest expert. And that typically, for my clients anyway, is things like appearing in a membership or a group program or a mastermind as a guest expert, typically presenting something in their area of expertise, and then often having a bit of a q and a portion afterward, which is really where the juicy stuff comes in. And often they find a lot of their marketing assets will which we'll get into in the next section. But then there's also collaborations. And this is not something that people necessarily think of as a speaking opportunity, but it really is. And they build into your blog and your business in the same way.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:03:10]:\
So that could be joint webinars or email swaps where you go and you write an email for someone else's list and they write an email for your list and you each send the other person's email so that the audience is getting some information and value that they might not be able to get from the person whose list they're subscribed to. And they get introduced to someone new who they may want to follow. You could also do social media lives with people, round tables. The list could go on. I've got a whole collaboration menu that I use for myself and my clients, and you can create one too of all the different collaboration opportunities that you want to be part of. The next step in your Visibility Ecosystem is Nurture. This is where we're going to take your speaking and collaboration opportunities and get those seeds planted so they can start to grow. This is things like creating Instagram posts, Facebook posts, content for LinkedIn.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:04:05]:\
There's so many different types of content over there. TikToks and Reels. You could do audiograms or use the actual video that you record from your speaking and collaboration opportunities. You could write blog posts, emails, the list could go on with this as well. But these are where you go and you take that content that you have created through your speaking opportunities and your collaborations, and you turn them into something more. Something that is visible to people who may not have been in your sphere during the speaking opportunities and the collaborations so that you can get in front of even more people and help them learn about you, get value from what you share, and, you know, maybe want to have you come and speak on their stages as well. Speaking of which, that brings us to the growth phase. So this is where those seeds that you planted through your speaking and collaboration opportunities start to grow as you nurture them and start to bear their own fruit and blossom in their own way.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:05:04]:\
So this could look like subscribers coming onto your email list. It could look like sales if you have affiliate marketing set up on your blog, or maybe you do have your own products, so you have a course or something like that. You may be finding new collaborators through this because people are seeing you and going, oh, I would really love to have something around that for my audience. Hey. How can we collaborate? And could I have you on my podcast? And things like that. And so that also grows your industry authority, helps you become known, drives traffic back to your blog, and that's where those other invitations also start to come in too. And then as you start to do that, I do want to go and dive into something that's a little bit of spicy take. Because I do believe very firmly that if you are not using a sustainable marketing system, you are probably spending more time than you really, really need to on your marketing efforts.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:06:01]:\
So that means your emails, your blogs, your social media, especially. This is one of the biggest things I see with my clients as they go, I'm so tired of being on that hamster wheel that is social media, of having to go and do all of these different Instagram posts and reels and TikToks and all this stuff and creating it from scratch. When if you're using a sustainable marketing system, you are creating content that you can use on an ongoing basis. With my clients, we have a whole database that we create out of all of their content from their speaking and collaborations, and we use that on an evergreen basis. They don't have to retire it. It's not a one and done. You're not just posting about a podcast episode that you appeared on the week after it goes live. You're using that on an ongoing basis.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:06:52]:\
So if you do a year's worth of podcast episodes and virtual summits and things like that, you're going to be building up a library of content that you can use. You're gonna be getting asked questions that can turn into blog posts and emails, and you're going to be able to grow your business so much more sustainably to get more traffic to your blog even easier than if you are creating all of that marketing content from scratch. So how do you actually get started with a sustainable marketing system? The way that I get my clients started is we create a podcast tour. We do that every quarter, aiming to get on typically 5 to 7 podcasts depending on what their goals are, how much traffic they're trying to drive, and things like that. You can set your own goals with that, but, usually, I'm reaching out to 20 to 30 podcasts, and we're getting anywhere between 5 to 10, sometimes more, depending on the time of year and things like that, yeses back from those podcast hosts. Then we're creating a recyclable presentation. So that means that you have a presentation that you don't have to create from scratch every time. This is one of the biggest frustrations my clients have with speaking on virtual summits, and it's one of the things that we love working with them on when we are working on their retainer packages or when they are joining us inside of the planting seeds group program that we have.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:08:15]:\
Because we are able to take it and make it into something that they don't have to rerecord all the time, that they can change how they're speaking over the slides rather than having to record the entire presentation. So it makes it so much easier, and it has kind of blown some of our clients' minds because they have been recording an entire new presentation. They've been creating new slides or at least doing a lot of adaptations to the slides that they have in order to create a new presentation every time, and it's really not necessary. So you can create a recyclable presentation. We'll go into all of this in a bit more depth in a second. And then you have to be sharing your speaking opportunities. This is where that nurture phase comes in and is what gets you all of those inbound invites, which is the last thing that you'll want to do to get started is set yourself up for those inbound invites. Alright.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:09:08]:\
So diving in, let's look at your podcast tour. So the process for this is gonna be finding 20 to 30 right fit podcasts. At Visibility Ecosystem, we are all about quality, not quantity. I have seen far too many people who have hired a PR agency or something like that, and they pitch them to a 100 podcasts, which sounds amazing. Except, maybe this person works with moms of autistic children. That's what their blog is about. And this person is pitching them to male attorneys who don't have kids. And it's just a really, really bad fit.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:09:48]:\
And so you have to be making sure that you are pitching quality podcasts that have the right fit for your audience, the right fit for your topic. And then you need to write customized e pitch emails for every single one. And I know that sounds like a lot, but there are ways to get that time down so that it's not taking up all of your time. And the more you do of them, the easier it's gonna be. I actually created an entire process for myself as I work with our No Fuss Podcast Tour clients So that it cuts down the time, but it also makes every single email customized to that podcast. They're not getting the same email that anyone else is getting, and that is going to increase the chances of getting a yes from those podcast hosts. And And then you have to actually send those podcast pitch emails because if you don't send them, obviously, you're not gonna get any yeses. And I know that can be really scary.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:10:37]:\
So you could go and hire someone to do it, something that we end up doing for our clients, but you don't have to. If you're really nervous about doing it, lend your inbox to a friend for the day. Say, hey, when you have your podcast pitch emails written, let's swap inboxes for a half an hour today and send each other's pitch emails. And that way, you don't have to get nervous about sending them. Someone else is gonna do it, and you can't tell them to stop because they need you to do it too. So getting some accountability with sending out those pitch emails can be really, really helpful for you. And then you also need to track the status of each podcast that you are pitching. So that means that you need to have a centralized database or some way to keep track of how these podcast pitches are doing.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:11:23]:\
Has it been sent? Have they responded back? Have you sent out 3 replies to those emails to follow-up with them, and they still haven't responded? And so maybe you decide that it's not worth it. I'm gonna go ahead and put that one on ice for the moment. But you need somewhere like that, so that's why we have a visibility ecosystem hub for our clients. We set that up in Airtable. That is my preferred platform for this type of thing. But if you have something that works better for you, if you use Trello or Asana or something that lets you keep track of all of that, then use whatever works for you. Just make sure that you are tracking those so that you don't lose any because that really, really sucks when someone comes back and goes, oh, I really wish that I had seen this, but I'm already booked out on podcast guests now. And then as those yeses start coming through, you gotta start recording those podcast episodes.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:12:11]:\
But that's where the fun part starts. So let's take a look at how this grows your blog. So as you go on a podcast tour, you're gonna be making new connections. Each of those podcast hosts is a potential collaborator, and you are then also getting in front of other people because people are listening to the podcast episodes, and they may be saying, oh, I would love to get that topic in front of my audience as well, and they'll reach out to you for inbound invites through that. You're also increasing your confidence. I cannot tell you how much podcast episodes can boost your confidence when you go and record that episode and the host hits stop recording, And they go, oh my gosh. That was amazing. I was taking notes, and now I'm gonna go implement that in my business too or implement that in my life, whatever your topic happens to be.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:13:01]:\
It also helps you hone your topic. The more questions that you get asked about your topic, the more you're going to realize, oh, I actually know what I'm talking about, which increases your confidence, but it's also going to help you really deep dig into the things that people are asking about your topic. So that way, you know, okay, these are the things that people are really interested in. A good host is going to be putting themselves in their listener shoes so that they know what their audience is gonna be asking, and they can kind of ask those questions for them. So as you go on a podcast tour, you're going to really hone in on your topic, and it is going to also help you use that honing to create more blog posts and other content around the topic and the questions that you're being asked about it. Alright. So then diving into how to recycle recycle your presentation, because this is one that not a lot of people talk about. And it is one of the most underutilized ways to actually make speaking at summits and other places where you need a presentation most of the time actually profitable.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:14:08]:\
So what you'll do is you will create your base presentation. So that is your base slides, or if you do really technical stuff, like I used to do Google Analytics topics, you may decide, okay. These are the ways that I'm gonna walk through it, and you have all of the links to the pages that you're gonna use for the walkthroughs. Whatever it happens to be, create your base presentation and your speaking outline. And then you're gonna duplicate that for different audiences. So you can record the main presentation one time, and then you can just go ahead and change some of the voice over, like how I'm talking right now over these slides, and find other ways to change it out to different audiences. So for example, as I'm talking to you as a blogger, the things I'm gonna tell you may be slightly different than the things I'm gonna tell an online coach. So you'll just adapt your stories and your speaking angles to your different audiences.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:15:09]:\
And then you'll record new introductions and outros. So that is just saying, hi. I'm so and so, and giving a little bit of context. Maybe that is a little bit more in line with the the audience and what they are identifying with with you. And then you can update that as needed. So you might decide you need to rerecord the intro sometimes, but if you don't have your face on the slides like, I'm doing that right now because I'm playing around with some new tech, and so I wanted to do that. But I typically recommend for my clients to record their slides without any of their face on it. So that way, it is way easier to switch it out.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:15:52]:\
If you're recording new intros and outros, it's not gonna look weird because you don't have to match your clothes. You're just having the intro and the outro, and those are gonna match, but there's nothing in between. And so that way, if you have to make edits, it's much, much easier. So how does having a recycled presentation grow your blog? Well, it saves you time. It saves you so much time. I have clients who said that they've stopped speaking at summits because it took too much time, and they weren't seeing the results that were commensurate with that time. And when we go and give them a recycled presentation, it saves them enough time that they can actually make the summons profitable. Plus, we have other strategies that help them get those into a more profitable space.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:16:37]:\
It also improves your presentation skills because the more that you are presenting the same presentation, the easier it is going to be to speak on that topic, which is also why honing your topic through a podcaster is gonna be really, really helpful. But you're just gonna get better and better at presenting that recycled presentation and adapting the stories to the different audiences. It also establishes your authority because when you're speaking on the same topic, I typically recommend my clients use 1 to 3 topics as their primary topics, so that they become known for those. So you can have little tweaks to those and adapt them to different areas, but you want to have the same overall theme that you were talking about on a consistent basis. So that is recycling your presentation. And then sharing your appearances is the next one that we're gonna dive into. So this is creating the social media posts and using audiograms or video or quotes or different things from your speaking present your speaking opportunities and your collaboration opportunities in order to create those social media posts. You can also write emails and even your entire blog post based off of interviews that you're having or from summit presentations that you're doing that you realize, oh, I could have dived into this a little bit deeper.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:18:03]:\
You'd be surprised how much you can get out of an interview or presentation that you can use for emails and blog posts. And then you have to make sure you're scheduling those assets, of course, because if you're not going and getting them out there, what good are they doing? And then you just get your rinse and repeat on Evergreen. So that is, like, where I said that my clients are given a database, an Airtable, where they can go and gather all of the social media assets and different speaking opportunities that they have. You wanna make sure that you have those for your marketing assets so you don't lose track of them and you can keep reusing them. Because, let's be real, most people are not gonna remember what you posted a year ago. So you can keep using those on an ongoing basis. So how does sharing these assets grow your blog? Well, like I've talked about before, it makes marketing easier, because you're not spending all your time creating these things from scratch. It also showcases your authority, again, because you are not only doing the speaking, but you are putting this content out there in front of people who may not have seen you speak, but are still going to get the value from it and recognize that you know what you're talking about.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:19:13]:\
And then it will also increase your speaking invites because, again, people see you speaking, but especially because they see you sharing. As a summit and podcast host myself, I can tell you that this is not something most guests do. So if you are sharing your speaking opportunities and your collaboration opportunities, more people are going to want to invite you onto their stages and in front of their microphones because they see that you're going to actually support what they're doing and share with your audience. Alright. So I also want to make sure that we bust some myths because this there's some things that I hear quite a lot, and you might be thinking them too. So in case you're thinking, yeah. I don't think this really applies to me. Here we go.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:19:57]:\
So first off, I hear a lot things like no one wants to hear me on a podcast, or I don't think anyone's actually gonna say yes if I pitch them. That is absolutely true if you never pitch anybody. So my challenge to you today is to go out and pitch someone. Just say, hey. I've been listening to your podcast for a while, and I've noticed that you haven't had anyone on to speak about x y z topic. Or maybe they have had someone on to speak about it, but they haven't done it from quite the same angle that you've got. So just go and ask. It doesn't hurt, and the worst they can do is say no or not respond.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:20:36]:\
Next up, I hear that virtual summits don't work anymore. This one comes up a lot, and I know I've mentioned it already that a lot of people think that they don't work because they are putting too much time into their presentations, or they are not approaching it with the right strategies. We teach this sleaze free sales framework here at Visibility Ecosystem so that you can actually make sales without feeling all gross about it. And so when you go into virtual summits with a recyclable presentation, with a sleaze free sales framework, and other strategies, you can actually get a return on the investment of time that you're putting into it. So don't think that just because summits are a little bit more work than a podcast interview, they're not worth it. I've gotten 4 figure sales from speaking at summits, and you can drive a lot of traffic to your blog and make sales too. I also hear that everybody's tired of webinars, which it is true. We are.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:21:33]:\
We are tired of webinars that don't give value and that just generally are not worth attending. But if you are putting on a joint webinar as a collaboration with someone where their audience is hungry for what you talk about and you make sure that you're actually providing value and it's not a pitch fest, it's more of a workshop or something to that effect, then 15 minutes of teaching and 30 minutes of selling, you're gonna be providing value. You're gonna be able to create marketing assets based off of it, and it is going to grow your blog. So that is kind of a quick overview and some deep dives into some of the steps that go into creating a sustainable marketing system, or as we call it a visibility, ecosystem around here. And I would love to hear what you think about that. So definitely go ahead and find me on threads, and let me know your thoughts on this. And I would love to support you as you go ahead and create your visibility ecosystem and have a sustainable marketing system for your blog. So get in touch, and let's talk more.\
\
Jenn Zellers [00:22:42]:\
Can't wait to hear what you think, and hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.280] - Jerry Potter, fiveminutesocialmedia.com/\
Thank you so much for being here. I'm excited to be part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit this year and today we're going to talk about actually, let me just here's my face. But this is not about my face. This is about you and helping you get more engagement reach and sales on social media. In fact, let me just share my screen there so we can focus on that. And today is going to be all about that. I'm going to share some strategies that nobody else seems to be talking about but that are relatively simple to implement in your business. But even though they're simple, they are powerful. And I think just about anyone will walk away from this with something that can make a massive impact. But I don't want to waste people's time. So, let's talk about who will benefit the most from what I'm going to talk about today.\
\
[00:00:53.050] - Jerry\
Okay, doe this sound like you like? You know, social media is important to your business, to your blog, but it leaves you feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. If so, this is going to be really helpful if you feel like you know what to do, but there's just not enough time to get it right or do it well. This will be helpful for you. And if you feel like your audience is engaged, but when it comes to buying, you only hear crickets, whether it's buying your products or maybe it's buying products you're an affiliate for or anything like that. So, if any of those sound like you, let me assure you you're in the right place and this should be helpful.\
\
[00:01:30.760] - Jerry\
So, I know that we all have to multitask, but a lot of the time with this type of training can be one tiny piece that makes a massive difference for you. And here's the thing about me. I ad lib quite a bit, and people have often said the biggest take away from one of these presentations was something I just said between slides. So, I am asking you that you close your other tabs, put your phone away, whatever it takes to focus. And of course, this will also make sure that the video stream comes through nice and clear. Also, as an efficiency geek, I never make presentations any longer than necessary. But to reward you for being here through the end, I want to send you this guide for free. Six Ways to Cut your Social Media workload in half and half is on the low end. By the way, some businesses that have gone through these have eliminated 80% of what they were doing and actually seen their results increase. And I'll share that so you can do the same before we wrap up today.\
\
[00:02:20.140] - Jerry\
So, now, if we don't know each other, and I'm assuming that for most of us we don't. My name is Jerry Potter. Yes, it rhymes with the boy wizard. And I founded Five Minute Social Media, which has helped over half a million different people worldwide. This year alone. I'm completely blown away and honored to have seen that happen. I've specialized in content creation and engagement strategies my entire career and the last ten years around social media. I created the Five Minute Social method, which is a system designed to cut the amount of time businesses spend on social media by up to 80% because you shouldn't have to spend that much time. You're trying to run a blog or a business. I also love speaking at conferences when those were still happening in person, but got to do a lot of virtual events over the last year as well and have spoken in person both here in the United States where I'm located, as well as abroad. I live in Seattle with my family, including my two Chinese superheroes. And the only thing you need to know about us as a family is we are that family that will go out in costume sometimes when the need arises.\
\
[00:03:20.170] - Jerry\
So, I want to tell you how I got here, because where I used to be might be exactly where you are now, overwhelmed and frustrated by social media. I was working for a company in 2014 that wanted us to post on Facebook 48 times per day. Now you can see that forty eight on the screen there. But when I talk about this on a Podcast, they'll usually say four to eight times per day, like four to eight. That's a lot. And I said, "No, no, no 48 times per day works out to 17000 something posts per year." Literally just throwing up everything that we can think of and hoping something would stick. And about a year later I started thinking there's got to be a better way to do things, you know, because one day somebody is telling you to post more. Next day they're telling us to post less. And I was still skeptical. I didn't have a team of copywriters or graphic designers or videographers. It was just me for the most part. No corporation size budget. Could I get results? And even if I found something that did work, what did you change again, the way social media always seem to do. So, the doubts were there, but I was determined. I just thought there's got to be a better way. Right. I started looking at all the things you can do on social media. Then I started correlating those with which tasks actually drove revenue, because ultimately that's why you have a business and maybe with your blog, it's not a business, maybe it's a movement. It's about getting information out there.\
\
[00:04:44.080] - Jerry\
Whatever that thing is that you're trying to do, the impact you're trying to have on the world, there are some things you can do on social media that help and others that don't. So, I doubled down on those tasks that were leading to revenue and the revenue started going up.\
\
[00:05:00.100] - Jerry\
Hey, surprise. The results started increasing. And then I stopped focusing on the tasks that make little to no difference. And all that happened was I got my time back and that's what leads me to today, I'm so excited to share the Five Minute Social method, which is what I'm going to share the framework of here to help you increase your engagement reach and sales.\
\
[00:05:21.120] - Jerry\
So, this was created I used to work at an agency and then I perfected it, working with hundreds of small business owners over the last few years. So, this is what I teach in depth in my signature course. But I'm going to show you the key principles so that you can start to see a difference literally today or tomorrow if you put some of these into play. And I'm going to do it by sharing solutions to four of the most common social media problems that I hear from here about from people.\
\
[00:05:46.830] - Jerry\
Number one, I have no reach and/or engagement because if nobody's seen your posts, they're not engaging or both and your social media is kind of dead in the water. Right. You're posting and nothing's happening. It's like being an unpaid social media intern in your own business.\
\
[00:06:04.260] - Jerry\
Number two, people find me on social media. I got lots of people, but they don't buy. Sometimes your visibility is good, but even when people recommend you, even nobody buys. OK, we're going to solve that problem today.\
\
[00:06:17.670] - Jerry\
Number three, my audience is engaged, but they don't buy. Sometimes you've got a good sized audience. They're engaging all the time, but they don't buy or hire you. So, let's tackle that.\
\
[00:06:26.310] - Jerry\
And number for business owners. Don't have time for good social media. I'll hear that a lot. Busy people don't have time for good social media. This is a common belief that I want to challenge. And by the time we're done, I'm going to show you how what we do with the five minute social method is to make sure that there is time.\
\
[00:06:45.240] - Jerry\
Okay, so let's start with the first one up first. I have no reach or engagement and we usually blame social media algorithms for this, right? The algorithm just won't show my posts to people. And a lot of times people will ask me, how do you beat the algorithm? How do you how do I hack the algorithm? And I wish that I could tell you that Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, sent me a text message once upon a time saying, "All you've got to do is post three point four, six times per week and we'll show all your posts to all your followers." Unfortunately, that's not true. But here's the thing. The algorithm can't be beat. It can't be hacked, but it can be romanced. And I say this because you have to work with the algorithm, charm and be friends with it, otherwise you shouldn't even bother posting. If you are not going to post in a way that the algorithm helps you, then don't bother. You will remain an unpaid social media intern in your business, as I did for a really long time.\
\
[00:07:50.400] - Jerry\
So, we're talking about engagement, reach and sales today. So let's talk about engagement versus reach. So, engagement is exactly what it sounds like. People engaging on your posts, liking, commenting, sharing, clicking the link through to your blog. All of that. And reach is the number of people who see your posts. So, when your post says 726 people reached or 13,420, that's how many people saw your post. Doesn't mean they read. It doesn't mean that they clicked on it or anything like that. It just means that it came into their feed at some point. But the important thing to know is that it's not engagement versus reach so much as it is engagement equals reach. They are directly tied to each other. So, when you put up a post on any social media network, the algorithm doesn't know how good it is, Instagram doesn't know that you took an amazing photo.\
\
[00:08:44.820] - Jerry\
LinkedIn doesn't know that the stuff you're saying is life changing. Facebook doesn't know that you spent 37 hours making the perfect graphic in Canva. All the algorithm knows is whether or not someone engages with it. So, when someone likes your post, the algorithm thinks, "Oh, okay, this might be okay content". When more people start liking it, commenting, sharing, the algorithm goes, "Oh, this is great content. I'm going to show this to more and more people. So, that takes us back here. Engagement equals reach. The more engagement you get, the more people your posts will reach. So, to romance, the algorithm. You've got to get engagement.\
\
[00:09:26.220] - Jerry\
So inside of my course, I show you a bunch of ways to get more engagement. And we're a little tight on time today for this. But let me get you started with a few of my favorite easy ways to increase your engagement today. People have started applying these and immediately seen results, which I love.\
\
[00:09:43.380] - Jerry\
And the first one is going to be super, super obvious. But a lot of times when somebody says, "Yeah, I just can't get the engagement", and I'll do an audit of their Instagram account or their Facebook business page or whatever it might be, I notice that they are not asking for engagement. Sometimes that's all it takes. You have to ask. Remember somebody's scrolling a social media feed is busy. It's kind of an oxymoron, right? Well, if they were busy, they wouldn't have time to scroll social media feed, but they're just scrolling through. Sometimes they're in line at the store. Sometimes they just have an extra 60 seconds. Other times they're trying to distract themselves. You have to ask. They're not nobody opens Facebook and goes, "All right, who can I engage with right now?" That's not the approach. So ask simple as that.\
\
[00:10:35.820] - Jerry\
Number two is to take a stance. This is one of my favorites and I love it because it makes a massive difference. And I'll share an example here in just a second. But taking a stance means that you are more likely to get engagement because you're going to elicit a response in somebody else. Now, when we feel an emotion, we are more likely to comment on a post if a post makes us feel something and sometimes all it takes is taking a stance, I'm going to use a silly example. But if you posted do you like pineapple on pizza? You might get a few people that would say, "Oh, yeah, I like pineapple" or "No, no, I don't like pineapple," that can be very polarizing for people. But if you said, "Pineapple is the worst pizza topping of all time, fight me on this." Well, they either think, "Yes, it is. It's so awful." And they'll comment that or they think, "No, it's not. I love pineapple on pizza." What's wrong with you? But you took a stance and it doesn't have to be frivolous like that. It could be about your product or your industry or any number of things. But when you take a stance on things, people will have an emotional reaction because they will either agree or disagree with you. All right. And as a blogger, you're probably taking a lot of opinions and stances, I would think, for most of you anyway.\
\
[00:12:02.140] - Jerry\
And then the third one comment on your own post. I love this one because it has. Exponentially increasing effects when it comes to engagement. I'll show you what I mean. So on this post, I said, "For your business, did you design your own logo or hire someone else? My awkward answer below, and this was just an organic post that got 117 comments. And when I asked this, I really didn't know that it was going to take off like this, but it did.\
\
[00:12:31.890] - Jerry\
But here's here's the principle here. You notice I said my awkward answer below. So when you post this, I said, "For your business, did you design your logo or hire someone else?" If somebody comes along and they don't have an answer right away, but they're like, "Oh, I wonder what his answer is. Oh, and it's awkward." They're going to click on that thing that says one 117 comments. Then they SEO when they do that, that counts as engagement because they clicked on it, "Oh okay, engagement." Then if they read my answer and they click like on it, that counts as engagement. If they then reply to my answer, that is also engagement. And if they're moved to then leave their own answer, because I've given an example that's more engagement. And if a bunch of people start commenting and then people start going through, even if they aren't going to post themselves and they start liking other people's comments and replying to them, that's all engagement as well. So, it really can snowball. But the best part about this is just like nobody likes to be the first one to a party, generally, nobody likes to be the first one to comment on a post. So, by you commenting yourself, you have already gotten that out of the way.\
\
[00:13:40.570] - Jerry\
Here's a funny taking a stance post, and if you can't read it because of the screen you're on, it says, "When is this country going to wake up and admit that watermelon is the worst melon and doesn't even come close to having as good a texture or flavor as honeydew or cantaloupe?" Now, I'm not going to use an example that's political or anything super polarizing like that, but here's a silly topic. But he got a lot of engagement on this post because he took a strong stance. If he just said, "I don't care for watermelon", people have been like, "Yeah, okay".\
\
[00:14:11.630] - Jerry\
So, which one of these will you try first side, really quick, you're going to ask for engagement, super basic, take a stance or comment on your own post and yes, those can be combined.\
\
[00:14:22.190] - Jerry\
All right. Now we know how to reach people, like getting them engaged. Let's dive into common problem number two; people find me on social media, but they don't buy. In other words, we're trying we're struggling to turn our followers into buyers now in most cases, or I should say in a lot of cases, people want to buy from you or hire you or whatever the case might be, but they just don't know how. If you use Facebook, you have probably seen this the last few years. The looking for recommendations feature. So, imagine someone asks their friends for a reference, looking for a home contractor, a life coach, photographer, fitness trainer, and someone recommends you they even tag your business in the comment. So now I've asked for a referral. My friend, who I trust recommends you. I go to your page. You got great reviews. I am ready to give you, like, take my money. But the problem is, I don't know how to hire you. I don't know how to I don't know what to do next. And I didn't put a slide here because I didn't want to accidentally call out someone that might be watching this.\
\
[00:15:21.680] - Jerry\
But I land on your page. There's no obvious next step to take with you. And it's not that as consumers, we're not smart, it's not that your people aren't smart, they're just busy. And I know on our end, you know, it's our page pager profile or whatever we're thinking like, well, duh, click on about scroll down, find my phone number and call me or send me a message or whatever. But again, we're busy. So what do we do? If I really like you, I'll tell myself I'll come back and figure it out later. I got to do some other stuff right now, but we almost never do because life just goes on. So, how do we avoid this? Make sure your pager profile has three things. All right. Turning followers into buyers.\
\
[00:15:59.670] - Jerry\
Number one, what you do now, in some instances, you can just choose a category like I think blogger is a category for a Facebook business page, and that could just be it. It says blogger. But you can't just say blogger.\
\
[00:16:14.730] - Jerry\
They need to know what kind of blogger you are. So make sure it's clear what you do. It may be obvious to you. It will not be to others. Maybe you can have a Facebook group where you don't know people very well and send them a ask a couple people to help you and send links, say, hey, can you figure out exactly what I do? Or look at my page for five seconds and tell me what I do?\
\
[00:16:35.130] - Jerry\
Next, why are you different? We each get bombarded with ten thousand brand messages a day, there are obviously millions of Facebook business pages and Instagram profiles and LinkedIn profiles and all of these things. You've got to stand out. Why are you different?\
\
[00:16:50.700] - Jerry\
And then the last thing that we were just kind of alluding to, what should they do next? That's it. What do you want me to do next? So, this is a Facebook business page, but you can see on the cover photo what I do. I coach business owners on how to attract more paying clients using the world's simplest social media strategies. Why I'm different. Focusing on simplicity. What I want you to do next, join my group. That's what the blue button says, because I know once people are in my group, I can nurture them into becoming part of my programs.\
\
[00:17:18.670] - Jerry\
Tom, who's a guy who is in my- took my course and is now in the face- my- sorry group coaching program, he optimized his business pages and the things I just showed you and a couple more things that we teach in the course. And he had a woman call his business to hire him. And he said, "Oh, how did you hear about him?" And she said, "Oh, I found you on Facebook." And at the time he only had one like on his Facebook business page. But she got there. She saw what he did. She saw why he was different and she knew what to do next. And the coolest thing is Tom has a local services business. He does dryer vent cleaning. He went out and then she told all her neighbors. And so this one thing led to a bunch more business. I think he said eventually in that neighborhood he did three thousand dollars worth of business or something like that.\
\
[00:18:04.540] - Jerry\
All right. Let's tackle common problem number three. My audience is engaged, but they don't buy. So, maybe this is something you struggle with. Like you've got people, they're engaged, they're commenting. And then you say, "Hey, it's time to buy or this is open", or whatever it might be, and nobody takes the time to buy anything. And I want to share a lie that I used to tell myself all the time, and you probably heard people say this, maybe even said it yourself, social media is only good for top of mind awareness. This what I used to tell myself for my social media wasn't working. My post for reaching people, sometimes lots of people, but it wasn't driving any revenue. And rather than figure out how to fix the problem, we tell ourselves things like, well, "It's good for top of mind awareness" or "Oh, my social media is just to increase exposure." "It's a branding exercise." And certainly social media can do those things.\
\
[00:18:56.650] - Jerry\
I used to tell myself it just can't be used to get people to actually buy or hire me or anything like that, especially, you know, maybe if I had a big budget or a big team. I don't know about you, but I don't have those things laying around.\
\
[00:19:08.840] - Jerry\
So, this is the typical social media plan: Somebody starts a business or they have their veteran business and they're like going to get on social media, going to set up all my networks, start posting and then wait for money. Why isn't it coming? I post every day. What's happening? What's missing from that plan is nobody set any social media goals. You might have goals, but if you're not making regular, trackable revenue from them, they might be the wrong goals. You got to set specific social media goals. Okay.\
\
[00:19:33.980] - Jerry\
So, let's talk about what social media goals are. They're different from your business goals? They may be different from your marketing goals. Your marketing goals might be to increase market share 10% or something like that. The goals are specific to social media. They are the catalyst, the spark that makes somebody become a paying customer or client or buy through your link or whatever it might be. Okay.\
\
[00:20:00.710] - Jerry\
Let's talk real quick about what social media goals aren't. Posting every day. Not a social media goal. Okay, that's a to do list. Getting more followers, not a social media goal because followers don't mean you'll get any sales. This woman had two million followers on Instagram, couldn't make any money from it. So, when you set a social media goal, it needs to lead to revenue. And when you figure this out, the results can be amazing.\
\
[00:20:22.730] - Jerry\
So, if you're a blogger, maybe you know that when somebody like for every hundred views you get on your blog, you make money, you make three hundred dollars on average or something like that. In that case, then your social media goal might be to drive blog traffic. But if that's not helping you, you know, you are trying to get money from it, not just get somebody to read what you're writing, then you may need to pivot.\
\
[00:20:46.280] - Jerry\
Michelle Taylor, who is in my group coaching program, she recently named one of her social media goals, and that was to get people on to webinars. And she had one post that led to fifteen hundred dollars a month in new revenue. Now, she's pretty humble, but I always joke with her that if those new clients stay for a full year and this is maybe four months ago now, they stay for a full year and hers pretty much will do that one post will be worth eighteen thousand dollars. This is what can happen when you like. Dial this in. It's amazing. One post. And by the way, no ad spend. This was one organic post.\
\
[00:21:20.030] - Jerry\
So, social media goals, what can they be? Well, start by figuring out what happens right before someone buys from you. That's that catalyst that I was talking about. Okay. And then for some businesses, think about what would cause people to buy from you without social media, then use social media to reach that goal. So, in my business, people often hire me after we have a conversation about their business. So, there's no social media that would involve going to networking events, meeting people. The social media equivalent of that is to get people into one on one conversations. So, that's one of my social media goals.\
\
[00:21:54.200] - Jerry\
Another one is to get people to join my email list, because I know that a certain percentage of those will go on to invest in a course or coaching. Now, if this is tough to figure out right at this second, you're not alone. I work on this a lot with people in my programs. But just think about what happens right before someone buys from you or hires you or does whatever that action is that you want them to take; something triggered them. So, what is that for you in this tiny mindset shift? Because once you figure this out, then you focus on those things and not just posting and hoping. This tiny mindset shift I've seen businesses change from, you know, struggling to making money in seven days. Once you figure this out, no more posting and hoping.\
\
[00:22:43.820] - Jerry\
And that does lead us to common problem number four, because these are related. "I'm too busy to have good social media. "Business owners are too busy to have good social media. I've said this. You may have said it or at least felt it. I probably hear it at least twice every single day with all the business owners I talked to online, which means I've heard it about seven hundred times in the last year. So, let's talk about it. There are two reasons we tell ourselves this. Number one, there are too many ways to market ourselves for free in the digital world. So, we do none of them well. Okay, number two, because we aren't making any money from social media. So, the first one, we're so distracted by the ninety nine thousand ways we can market ourselves, we don't do any of them well.\
\
[00:23:29.560] - Jerry\
And I'm just as guilty as you have constantly of new ideas. I want to try in my business. It didn't used to be this way back in the day. Any marketing you did required spending money. It could be on buying ads or getting scrappy and doing it yourself. But it still required printing letters, cards, flyers, posters, buying stamps. The point is, marketing used to cost money pretty much no matter what. So, there was no sorry. So, there was way more focus on getting things right. If you were going to spend even a few hundred dollars printing posters or sending out postcards, you put in the work to make it as good as it can be. But now, because we have all these social media channels and email and all these other things that we can sort of reach people free, we all we try everything. We sort of put 40% effort in it and we wait for something to work. And then that second one, we were too busy because we aren't making any money from social media. Who has time to work on things in their business that don't generate revenue? That's kind of the whole point, right?\
\
[00:24:24.880] - Jerry\
So, if you spend an hour a week, five hours a week, 10 hours a week on social media or some sort of obligation, maybe because everyone else is doing it, because someone you trust told you to that you had to. By the way, I'll never tell you that I'm not here to convince you. You have to market on social media. I work with people that already see the amazing potential of it and want to maximize it. But if you're spending time on social media and see no financial return, you'll always feel like you're too busy for it. But if you figured out a way, then for every hour you spend on social media, you made two hundred dollars in your business or five hundred dollars in your business, I bet you'd find the time, right? Oh, look at that. I am not busy anymore and I'm just throwing out numbers.\
\
[00:25:04.630] - Jerry\
A couple of minutes ago I told you about Michelle Taylor in the eighteen thousand dollar post. The point is, when you have regular, trackable revenue from your social media, you have no problem making time for it.\
\
[00:25:15.850] - Jerry\
So, let me see if I can help you envision how that would work in your business. So, we asked you to set these specific social media goals that would directly lead to revenue. The next step is to use those goals to eliminate all the things you do on social media that don't make money. Or if you are a blogger, that you're not in it for the money, whatever it might be, whatever your goal is. So, I want you to take your goal or one of them and reverse engineer it into a plan. That's right. We're going to build the plan backward.\
\
[00:25:49.000] - Jerry\
So, we talked about the typical plan. We set up your social media network, start posting, wait for money. One of the problems is that plan is built forward. Guess what happens when you build your plan backward? Then you can eliminate all the tasks that don't help you reach your goals. So, here's one example that might apply to you. So, we start off with the end goal, which, for this example, is revenue. It's money. It's the green dollar signs. Right. So, how do I- what's the catalyst that gets somebody to buy from me or buy a product I recommend or whatever it is? Well, usually I know that if a qualified buyer joins my email list, I make money in it. Then maybe you even know the numbers. For every hundred that join my email list, five of them become buyers or twenty or whatever it is. Okay, so what happens before that? That's the game we're playing. What happens before that? Well, right before a qualified buyer joins my email list, they usually read a highly targeted blog. And in that blog I have a download or just something that comes up in an online form they can fill out in the middle of the blog, whatever it is, say you read a highly targeted blog. Okay, well, how do I get more people to read the highly targeted blog? I share the blog and a niche specific Facebook group. So this is just one example of me working backwards from revenue. OK, what happens before that? What happens before that? What happens before that?\
\
[00:27:10.920] - Jerry\
And then we flip it around. Now we have our plan. I'm going to share this blog post, a niche Facebook groups for moms, for entrepreneurs, for puzzle fans. Whatever it is, you know, whatever your blog is, people will hopefully click through, read that highly targeted blog because they're the perfect person to read it. They will join my email list and then many of them will become buyers. That's just one example, but you take your goals, you reverse engineer them and then any other tasks that aren't leading to something that helps you reach your goals, in most cases, revenue ditch them and business owners end up cutting their workload by 50 to 80 percent by doing this.\
\
[00:27:49.770] - Jerry\
So, again, the four common problems, I have no reach and/or engagements, people find me on social media, but they don't buy. My audience is engaged but doesn't buy. Business owners don't have time for good social media. And the solutions that I shared today to help you increase your engagement, reach and sales. First, you have to increase your engagement if you're going to increase your reach, so you've got to ask for engagement, make people feel something, take a stance, all of those. Second, optimize your pages and profile. So when people do discover you, they know what you do, why you're different and what to do next. Third, set these proper social media goals. And fourth, reverse engineer your strategy to eliminate the unnecessary tasks.\
\
[00:28:31.900] - Jerry\
All right, I hope this was helpful. As promised, here is the link to my free guide, Six Ways to Cut your Social Media workload in half. And some of what we talked about in there today is in there. But there's also some other stuff. So, you can go again to five minute social media, Fiveminutesocialmedia.com/half. And if you follow up, if you want to follow me, you can contact me through my website as well, which is Fiveminutesocialmedia.com as you'd expect.\
\
[00:28:58.060] - Jerry\
So, I hope this was helpful. Thank you so much again for watching. And if there was that like I said, if there was anything, maybe you don't have a question, but one piece was especially helpful. I love that feedback because I can keep sharing it with more people and help them streamline their efforts on social media to get more results in less time. So, again, I'd love to hear from you at Fiveminutesocialmedia.com.\

If I do say so myself.\
\
[00:00:28.850] - Interviewer\
Please welcome Juliet Stapleton. Juliet, thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:33.410] - Juliette\
Hi, Liz. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for having me. And yes, our second name is pretty awesome. It's a really beautiful name. And I tell you, this is not the name I was born with, but ever since I have acquired this name, everything's changed in my life. So, there is magic to it.\
\
[00:00:51.290] - Interviewer\
I like it. I like it.\
\
[00:00:53.690] - Interviewer\
Alright.\
\
[00:00:54.110] - Interviewer\
So, let's go ahead and dive in because you specialize specifically in Facebook, which is just a beast in and of itself. How you know we're going to talk about kind of how you attract your audience with Facebook. But what makes Facebook different from, like, a blog post in terms of you know what's really the goal and kind of how do you switch your mindset for it?\
\
[00:01:17.850] - Juliette\
Well, when you're a blogger, I think there is a little bit of a challenge because you're used to expressing yourself, let's say in a particular way. Sometimes, you know it's more strategic for some people, you know maybe sharing some valuable tips and things like that. For some people, it's more of a personal story sharing. But we have to think about in terms of audience. When we're posting something on a blog, how do people see that. We are driving traffic. We have to drive traffic to the blog. We have to optimize it.\
\
[00:01:48.330] - Juliette\
So, maybe they will find it in search engines. And the keyword here is find. So, people who we are attracting to our blogs are people who are seeking a particular information. And so, something in your headline Hooker, you know title, something triggered the seeker in a person. And so, they went and they ended up on your blog. That's who you are attracting. However, on social media, people don't go there to seek for information. It's something that everyone you have been there today. You have been in this situation.\
\
[00:02:27.090] - Juliette\
You picked up your phone, and I do it in my first, like, 15 seconds, I'm really bad at this of my morning I mean. And you went to do what you want, not to read, not to engage, not to learn, not to buy. Obviously, you went there to look. That's what you actually do. You're just looking, staring at the screen scrolling. And the only time when your brain will engage in the next step, which will be reading, for example, is when you see something that is so familiar, it triggers you on emotional level somewhere.\

It just resonates immediately. So, the first line, that's when your brain says, okay, stop, a little light goes up and you just say, okay, let's read this. And of course, there's a lot of things that we read are a lot of nonsense, especially when you are I call it a zombie mode. When we are on social media and Facebook, we're in the zombie mode. We're just too much distraction. We suffer as humanity suffers with constant state of destruction. Anyway, not destruction, distraction anyway, I think hopefully not destruction, but it does destroy our focus.\
\
[00:03:39.390] - Juliette\
Right. And it does make us think about, okay, so let's just flip the coin here now as content creators, how do we deal with this. If my audience on Facebook comes to me, but they're all like trying to wake up or trying to just chill. They're not coming to necessarily read my content. And I write, guys, I write really long posts. Probably the longest posts you may have seen on Facebook are from me. So, you know I require a lot of focus from my readers. How can I get them to actually read and go to the end where there may be some sort of call to action.\
\
[00:04:18.330] - Juliette\
And the only way to do it is to start with something that's extremely relevant. Whereas when we write a blog, we can introduce someone to a topic. And because they were seeking actively for this information or there's something that brought them there, they are already there. You know it's like if you were doing a presentation in front of a few people or if you have a performance background, when you have a performance, audience comes in. Well, they came in with an intention to look at you because if you just went into the middle of the street and started doing the same act. Not necessarily,\
\
[00:04:53.130] - Juliette\
people will stop. Some probably will, because they will resonate and they will like this sort of art. But some won't. Right? So, Facebook is a street. We have to, as opposed to the audience that comes there with an intention to consume your content. We have to do our act. And it really is like street art because we have to accept the fact that there is a constant movement. And a lot of people imagine, you know I don't know, Times Square in New York, somewhere like, this crossing that they show Tokyo and this crossing and they're just walking, walking, walking.\
\
[00:05:25.170] - Juliette\
How do you make them stop? First of all, you don't need everybody to stop because they're not all the right people for you. You just need the people who resonate with you to stop and whatever you're doing, whether you're blocking just because it's something that you want to do or you are actually monetizing it. And in that case, it becomes particularly important that the right people stop. You just need to be doing your thing, doing your thing really well. But kind of doing it in a way that if they just blasted you, they know that that's something that they like.\
\
[00:05:52.410] - Juliette\
So, it's all about formatting our text and changing the order of how we present the information. So, everything that we start with needs to be kind of the most important point. And in terms of marketing, when you talk about what's the ideal person I'm trying to attract, what is the ideal target? What is the ideal clients? You know what is the audience, what are they thinking at 03:00 in the morning when they are frustrated, they can't sleep. What's going on through their mind? What are the words they're using?\
\
[00:06:30.030] - Juliette\
That's really important for social media writing, really using the simple English words that are going through our heads as opposed to some sort of like a more professional language or you know coaching language or any kind of terminology, which you can use when you're writing your blogs. Because the audience came there with an intention to consume your content. Do you see the difference? \
\
[00:06:53.670] - Interviewer\
Yes. Yes. And I think it's one of the things where using fancy language or something on social media doesn't make you look like more of an authority when you're using on social media, it just makes you look kind of annoying.\
\
[00:07:06.750] - Juliette\
Well, yeah, it depends on if your target audience speaks that language or not as an example. So, for example, I target coaches. And in the coaching world, we use a lot of words like transformational, alignment, and the coaches know what it is. Even though these words mean thousands of things to thousands of people. It's just know, for them, they kind of know what I mean when I say alignment, even the word clarity. But those are the kind of words. But if you are targeting ordinary people who are not in the coaching world, they don't understand when you say you know transformational energy coach, what does this mean?\
\
[00:07:46.230] - Juliette\
You know, so fancy language and actually sounding professional. It depends on who you're trying to impress. You're trying to impress your peers or you're trying to attract clients or monetize. Or you're trying to trigger people. And if you're trying to trigger, when I say trigger, it sort of cause a positive response or stop the scroll. You are trying to stop. You're trying to wake up a zombie, and that's a different task. And professional language doesn't do it. It actually puts the zombie back to sleep. And as you said, for some people, it's just too much because the brain is so not active.\
\
[00:08:22.050] - Juliette\
It's not that it's not even active. It's just not focused and in tune with what you are trying to say, that the big words and you know fancy language becomes very difficult to read. Yeah. And that's the difference. So, even if you're using that kind of language in your blog, which is your style and your voice, and that's what you do. I think that finding the way to simplify the language when you are driving traffic from Facebook, for example, to your blog, which, that will be sort of your goal.\
\
[00:08:54.450] - Juliette\
Just simplify it. Simplify. Put it in a, you know five year old sort of language, not baby speak, but very, very simple. If you set it to a child, they would kind of get what it was. And that's really the key.\
\
[00:09:08.790] - Interviewer\
I like it.\
\
[00:09:09.390] - Interviewer\
Okay.\
\
[00:09:09.690] - Interviewer\
So, let's move on what would you say is the ideal Facebook post format. You talked about it a little bit, but kind of how do you stop the scroll with the format? Because you know all the posts can have some text or some image or some video and they're just scrolling. So what do you do to make a difference?\
\
[00:09:30.090] - Juliette\
Well, let's just establish that there is no such thing as one format of the post that will work. Right? So, you have to find the goal with all sort of marketing social media, especially is to find your own way and just discover what actually attracts people that you want to attract for you. So, for some people, it could be maybe losing a lot of emojis in their posts. But for me, it's a turn-off. Right. So, the secret here is just to make sure. Okay, here, let's just talk about the most important thing.\
\
[00:10:08.010] - Juliette\
The most important thing is that we only see two, three lines when we are looking. When we don't go visiting each other's profiles. It's important that we optimize them. It's important that we have all the stuff, good stuff there, but we don't use each other's profiles, and even less, we go to pages. I like what a lot of people think that they use only their business page and they don't use their profile. But actually people visit pages even less. So, we rely so heavily on the newsfeed and in the newsfeed because there's just so many, there's 2 billion users on Facebook alone, and you know there's 90 million pages or something like that.\
\
[00:10:44.910] - Juliette\
Everybody's posting. And plus every fifth post is sponsored. So, you know you're bombarded with this content all the time. And all you see is this three lines, three or four lines on the desktop, maybe five. Like, I think on the phone we get a little bit more preview. So that is the most important part of your post of whatever format or whatever way or whatever voice or whatever style you want to use. But that is going to be make or break, whether they're going to stop the scroll and read. And hopefully, someday turn it not someday, but going through your funnel, turn into a buyer from just a scroller or they're just going to scroll.\
\
[00:11:22.810] - Juliette\
So, use whatever, say, for example, you wrote a post and maybe it was a post about, maybe it was a post about people-pleasing. And you're talking about people-pleasing and you want to promote this post, or you want to write something that will be similar on social media. Because I wasn't looking for this information, I'm just happened to be in the newsfeed when your post comes in. If your opening line describes some sort of scenario that I was a people pleaser, how it made me feel, like literally, illustrate what does it look in somebody's life.\
\
[00:11:58.150] - Juliette\
That's the best in my opinion, because we have all different opinions. You can take delirious, but in my opinion, that's the best way to get a person to click on, read more and start reading rather than giving a generic statement. Or some sort of, sometimes I see people even putting the titles like we have titles on our blogs and they put them as a title of their post. And I'm saying, you just wasted one or two lines. You wasted it because you know I actually didn't get to read the whole sentence after that, because it got cut off.\
\
[00:12:27.250] - Juliette\
And so, my brain just was scroll by. The brain doesn't want to work, so we will only work if it's worth it. And if it only becomes worth it when suddenly we recognize ourselves. So, our, you know brain starts liking up and wants more of this. So, it's all about getting the person to crave a little more. And we need to get away from generic statements and start with just illustrate. Like, imagine, tell them to imagine something. Ask them a question that illustrates something that was in their lives.\
\
[00:13:01.450] - Juliette\
For example, one of my clients just wrote a post and I really loved the opening. And she said, who were you when you married your partner? Were you still the same person? And that opens up who you know kind of warms in a way because you start saying, am I still the same person because my husband. And then you start reading to make sure that you are or you're not. And if not, then get some sort of help. And the post gave a lot of you know valuable tips for those people who were not very happy.\
\
[00:13:31.450] - Juliette\
But it was the triggering question that stopped the scroll. I actually stopped my scroll before I even realized it was from my clients. So that's exactly what I'm talking about in terms of social media. I'll give you another good example. When next morning, tomorrow, or maybe today, you're scrolling mindlessly on Facebook. And then you stop, something made you read, just kind of ask yourself, what was it? Why am I reading this? So, was it something how they opened the post? What was it? Was it a picture?\
\
[00:14:07.150] - Juliette\
That's another, you said images. Was it an image? Was there something in the image and even a selfie can do that if there is a really nice selfie. All my visuals are selfies because I really love them. And I'm also a control freak. And no photographer can get inside my head. It seems. But if you take a selfie with that energy that you are writing your post, maybe that energy alone can trigger the person. And just you know we work on intuitive level a lot. It's not always about strategies or exact words or anything.\
\
[00:14:39.730] - Juliette\
It's just sometimes you can see something and something just makes you read more. But that's another way that you can consider what is the image that comes with this? Is it an image of you? Is it some sort of like a graphic that is very interesting. Maybe you wrote an article full of tips and you want to add a graphic that has the best tips listed, and that you know creates some sort of interest straight away as well. If it's relevant, obviously to the reader. Does it make sense?\
\
[00:15:08.590] - Interviewer\
Yes. Yes\
\
[00:15:09.250] - Interviewer\
No, it does.\
\
[00:15:10.990] - Interviewer\
So, because Facebook, the Facebook feed feel like a lot of stuff can get lost in it.\
\
[00:15:18.370] - Interviewer\
It doesn't even get shown you know.\
\
[00:15:21.070] - Interviewer\
So, what sort of frequency would you say people should be posting on Facebook to try to actually be seen in that feed?\
\
[00:15:29.590] - Juliette\
To be honest with you, they're kind of two legs to this to being seen. One is the frequency. And yes, you have to post daily. If somebody tells you that you don't need to post daily, that's too much work, blah, blah, blah. They're just feeding into your need of not being there. Right? But the truth is that when we ask ourselves you know, if you have to do a quiz. I say something and you need to respond straight away what came into your mind? If I say fast food, you probably will say McDonald's, right?\
\
[00:16:05.690] - Juliette\
Why? Because McDonald's ads are everywhere. Even if you never go to McDonald's, you will still say McDonald's for fast food. Why? Everywhere, side of the bus, you know every kind of like stops, stations, you know side of the shops. But they are not promoting deals. They're just saying "McDonald's, I'm loving it". It's called an awareness campaign. So, when they have their $1 deal or whatever, it sits on top of the awareness campaign, and that becomes very effective in terms of marketing and client attraction. It's just constantly being there when you're posting frequently.\
\
[00:16:42.710] - Juliette\
And it's not as hard because we have a lot of tools that allow us to automate. We can take a piece of content and create loads of little small pieces of content. This is probably, you know we might talk about it, but this might be a topic for another kind of talk. But you know when you're approaching it strategically, you don't need to work that hard. But you need to make sure that you're there all the time, because if you are not there all the time, then you're not on top of mind of people who are mindlessly scrolling.\
\
[00:17:07.550] - Juliette\
Facebook is not an enemy. Facebook algorithm is not some horrendous invention that stops people from seeing you. Most of the time, the truth is that you haven't been consistent. And you're also not engaging with people who are engaging with you. You know there's a lot of things that you can do as a user, become a little bit more active. And just block your time in the morning when you're scrolling mindlessly, right, you can also use ten minutes that you just go into your post and see if anyone liked.\
\
[00:17:38.810] - Juliette\
You go to their profiles like go to their profiles and like their last post and connect to your audience that way. So, if you show Facebook algorithm that you're an active user, you're kind of going to get a little bit more love as well. And that's the second leg. One leg post daily, create consistently, be that McDonald's ad on the side. So, your name, it doesn't matter what you say. Post a funny picture. Post a picture of your puppy. It doesn't matter what you're posting. It's about being there all the time.\
\
[00:18:09.830] - Juliette\
That's why staying visible is easy. Of course, you want to be strategic about it. Of course, you want to share, you know authority. You mentioned earlier. You know your fancy words don't make you an authority. But if you, for example, wrote a guest article and submitted to, maybe I don't know, Addicted to Success, or Medium.com, or entrepreneur became a contributor. That's authority, right? So, you can use that to occasionally repost things that build up your authority. And that's a piece of content. So, again, you're there. And for me, if I'm a relevant person to you know the person that you want to attract, maybe I don't know you.\
\
[00:18:48.170] - Juliette\
First, I don't care. You know I scroll by, but over time I start seeing you more and more and more, and there was, maybe really good openings on your post that made me read. Even if I wasn't interested, it was just that line made me click on Read More. For Facebook, clicking on Read More button is a form of engagement. For us, we think that only comments and likes. And if nobody comments and likes, it's like drama, because there's no engagement. But there is engagements, people who are serious about you.\
\
[00:19:16.430] - Juliette\
And especially, if you're writing really good posts, like really valuable. A lot of people actually just go and consume that information and it sinks deep, deep in. But they forget to comment or like, which is still okay because they clicked on Read More and they read the whole post. So, there is a way of manipulating the algorithm, but just make it to your best friend because it can be. It's only a piece of code. It's not there, it's not there to prevent anyone from seeing anyone. This is just you know kind of like some marketers use this scary discourse.\
\
[00:19:51.110] - Juliette\
It's not true, but you can use it to your most advantage. And of course, the more frequent you are, the more you're engaging with other people, the more you're focusing on one thing. That's why you know I said to at least straight away, I'm a Facebook girl. Don't ask me about LinkedIn. Don't ask me about Instagram or any other platforms because I made a decision four years ago when I turned into online marketing and I had a digital marketing agency. And I knew, I used all these other platforms, too, for my clients.\
\
[00:20:21.350] - Juliette\
But for me, I said, I need a platform. I need to be in one place, but that place going to be Juliet's domain. And it was my personal profile because I could send people friend requests. And you know I could produce content. I don't do any sort of outreaches, spammy techniques. I just write. And I go live or you know I do interviews. And I let people observe and the right ones, they self-identify the right ones. They want more of me. They want to binge on Juliet. So, they go into my blog and they go into my website and they find my offers and they become clients, some of them.\
\
[00:20:58.670] - Juliette\
So, this is turning into this kind of funnel. So, you can take the same approach and turn it into a funnel on your blog where you do all the monetization. \
\
[00:21:10.010] - Interviewer\
Yes. Okay. So I did want to ask really quickly, are you using ads to be seen more at all?\
\
[00:21:17.510] - Interviewer\
Does that come in?\
\
[00:21:18.530] - Interviewer\
When would that come into play?\
\
[00:21:21.110] - Juliette\
I will be honest with you. No, but I wasted a lot of money on ads. So, there is a no for two reasons. One reason is because I market, I position myself as an organic marketing coach. So, you know if I was running a lot of ads and said, let's do it all organically. It was kind of go against me. But I did. And I have sometimes, and I sometimes even now do use ads a little bit to boost you know my visibility a little bit. But it's always a waste of money for me. This is as transparent as it gets. Because the truth is that I think maybe for the blog, if you were, if it's, maybe it's not a really personal blog, it's more kind of you know valuable.\
\
[00:21:59.970] - Juliette\
It could work to use the ad. But you would only want to use ads when you have a completely proven validated method of monetizing or getting clients from what you are writing. When you have done this with your organic, so free visibility. And you know that, okay. So when they come and they click on this particular, maybe call to action to this blog article, then they come there. And then I have maybe three suggested articles that are relative and it feels like they click here. And they come to this article and then they sign up to my freebie and they get onto my list from this article.\
\
[00:22:35.370] - Juliette\
And so, I can actually create an ad that brings more people that are relevant to this article. Because I know that from this article, they come and they enter here and they go here. So, when you know how you get your clients or how you make money, then you can put money behind it. Sometimes, and this was, again, I'm very, very honest. I'm like straight talker. I am extremely fluid in my marketing. And I love it because I test and try so many different things, especially with organic marketing. And sometimes, I have clients that are coming in one way, and sometimes clients coming in the other way.\
\
[00:23:13.450] - Juliette\
I don't have in my business that just like one way I get clients. They go in and sign up to this masterclass, and that's how they go. And this is why, for me, every time I'm using ads, it just doesn't make sense because I'm not scaling. So, there's the word you need to use ads when you want to scale the results that you're already consistently getting with free content. That's my opinion. Again, you know like, experts in this world of coaching and marketing, everybody has their own opinion. There's no right or wrong strategy.\
\
[00:23:45.190] - Juliette\
You are here to figure out your own unique strategy, just wanted to put it out there. But this is one of the approaches. You know, maybe do it organically and you can. Yes. Yes. Start that way anyway. You have to start that way. Because when you are starting, you don't yet know who you're targeting. You might decide, but you don't yet know, you know what. If you're actually reaching them. Yeah, yeah, it's a process. And I know a lot of programs they decide on your ideal clients. And the ideal clients is something you discover over the course of your, you know, many years.\
\
[00:24:21.070] - Juliette\
To be honest with you, it gets clear and clearer. You pivot. So, it's sometimes very difficult, especially, and that's why there's a lot of money wasting happens with ads that we don't know. You know if I say that I want to target coaches. It's such a huge area. But what about these other things? The particular people who like particular things, who like my energy. So for me, audience growing would be much more doing interviews, writing, you know sharing. So, if you're really, writing is your thing, you're a blogger, then make sure that you're not only staying on your platform, your own blog, that you're going.\
\
[00:24:55.690] - Juliette\
Even if you're just simply republished the same stuff to medium.com, you are reaching new people. You know if you have other platforms where maybe you know you don't need to write original content, but you're reaching more people with the same piece, so.\
\
[00:25:11.830] - Interviewer\
I have two more questions.\
\
[00:25:13.810] - Interviewer\
So, my question is kind of where, you know because you're tracking them with those first few lines so that they hit Read More. Where does your call to action come into play? What kind of call to action would be most effective?\
\
[00:25:24.130] - Interviewer\
I know it kind of depends on your offer. But, for you know.\
\
[00:25:25.630] - Juliette\
For bloggers. It's a really good question because it kind of has to do with what type of content Facebook hates. Facebook hates links. So, if your call to action is read more here, Facebook is going to do whatever it can to the algorithm, in that case, is not going to like. Because you're sending people away from the platform. So, Facebook wants everyone to stay on Facebook. But the platform, the algorithm is not intelligent enough to even figure out that maybe you're sending them into your group. So, every time you add a link into your call to action, your visibility naturally will be the least possible you know, so.\
\
[00:26:06.950] - Juliette\
My trick is that my call to action, you don't have to write really long posts. You can just, if you wrote a really good article, think about how can this what I just talked about be illustrated in somebody's life. You know some sort of frustration or something, start with that. That will be your trigger. And then you can just say, I just finished this article that I go through this, this, and this, and explain how to do this and this and this link is in the comments. If you love it, come back and give me you know gif in the comments or something like that, or do you want it?\
\
[00:26:42.230] - Juliette\
That's one of the ways. And then you put the link in the comments. And another one, if you want to build engagement, there's a tactic for you. You can say I just wrote this, put the juiciest, you know, points. Do you want it? And they have to say yes. And then you send the link either you can post the link as a reply. But I sometimes go one step further because you want to engage all the possible tools that Facebook has and messenger tool is a great tool.\
\
[00:27:13.010] - Juliette\
So, instead of putting the link publicly and then everybody else doesn't want to engage with me because they saw the link and they just clicked there. I can say, hey, great, I'm sending it to you. And then I go to this person's messenger and I say, hey, thanks, Amelia. There is the article. So, I triggered a messenger. I made a personal connection. I don't have to go into any pitching. I don't have to go into any chats. Trust me, I'm someone who doesn't like talking to strangers at all.\
\
[00:27:40.190] - Juliette\
And they call me the Queen of visibility, right. And I'm a Facebook girl. So, it's possible even when you're an introvert and all these things. But the personal connection means a lot. So, if you send a message, the person feels great. Facebook likes the fact that you used messenger and you know what, every time you can actually experiment. Next time you send a message to someone that you haven't spoken for a while. If they are active on Facebook, you will start seeing their posts in your newsfeed for the next week or two because it triggers because it says these two users, they're very close.\
\
[00:28:11.450] - Juliette\
We need to show them more of their content. So, it's really, really good for you. And it builds engagement and it builds connection with your audience. So that's something that you can also do. That would be a strategy. \
\
[00:28:21.470] - Interviewer\
Yeah. No, I love that. I've already got ideas going.\
\
[00:28:27.450] - Juliette\
Don't put links into, don't say, here's the article, there is a link because it's going to, you know it just reduces your visibility. What you can do is after a couple of days, you can go back to the post and add the article to the main body because the whole algorithm scanning it and deciding, you know that's all kind of finished now. If you want to do it, but it's perfectly okay in the comments. \
\
[00:28:49.950] - Interviewer\
Okay. No, I like that.\
\
[00:28:51.390] - Interviewer\
Okay.\
\
[00:28:51.750] - Interviewer\
So, we talked about sort of repurposing with this stuff, but how long does it take you to do this kind of marketing?\
\
[00:28:58.590] - Interviewer\
Really.\
\
[00:28:59.010] - Interviewer\
Especially if you want to do a daily opportunity.\
\
[00:29:00.630] - Interviewer\
You can batch and schedule and stuff. But how long are you spending kind of creating this content and getting it scheduled for Facebook?\
\
[00:29:09.210] - Juliette\
Well, let's put it this way. I am Facebook marketer first, blogger, 15th, so I usually write on Facebook. And my posts are like blogs, and I take them and they just tweak slightly and put them onto my blog. So, I do it all in reverse. Whatever time it takes you to create your piece of content, say, for example, you're writing a blog post. So, whatever time you spent on that, that's your time for the creation. What you need to be is strategic while you're writing this. And I know a lot of publications require that as well.\
\
[00:29:44.010] - Juliette\
When you pitch an article to them is think about a couple of blurbs. You know a couple of blurbs what your article is about, but keep my advice you know in mind. Try and make it like to do with everyday life stuff or people's thoughts or some sort of inner feelings. Try and present what you did in the article to do with the person's inner world or everyday life. And that would be your blurbs. So, if you wrote an article while you're in that creative process, write two or three blurbs. And those are the two or three blurbs you can use to promote this article to open your social media post.\
\
[00:30:20.610] - Juliette\
So, you don't need to do to write a lot of stuff for the social media post. You can just juicy, you know introduction, create a niche graphic. Maybe you already have a promotion of your blog and then post this. But in reply to a question, how often or how long I have to do this, in terms of how long the process of your marketing is every day. Marketing is not an A to B. Marketing is a journey like it's a process. It's like a habit that you have like you brush your teeth.\
\
[00:30:51.570] - Juliette\
If you want to have healthy mouth, you brush your teeth. If you want to have healthy business, you market you know. And if you want to you know make money or attract clients or attract just people reading your stuff, you need to do it every day. But not every day needs to be groundbreaking as I said. So, it doesn't take long. I love memes. I have a cool collection of my phone. Every time, I see a meme, I'm like I'm stealing this because you know humor means a lot to me. So, I use that on some days and that builds much more engagement and you will notice that. And don't take it personally.\
\
[00:31:25.110] - Juliette\
If post about your blog doesn't get as much engagement as a photograph of your puppy. Because that's normal. Because that's what social media is about. It's easy to, you know it's easy to engage. It doesn't require thinking. You know it's just kind of impossible. So that's fine. So, we use those posts that are easy to engage. Jokes, heads, you know whatever your passions are. I don't use religion and politics, but if that's your thing, do that. And that builds your engagement. Next day, you give them a serious post to your blog because a lot of people will see on the back.\
\
[00:31:59.910] - Juliette\
It's like surfing, right? So, you're surfing the wave of engagement. But what happens after they've engaged with, maybe meaningless post. Give them something more serious, but they will see it. And they will click on that Read More. The right ones, they will click on that Read More button. They will go and check out if you have links in the comments and they'll do everything you are asking them to do, provided they're the people you're targeting, and it's relevant to them. Because they will see it on the back of your question, earlier question about how do we get seen it's this kind of riding this wave and making sure that you're not just oh, just my blog.\
\
[00:32:30.570] - Juliette\
My blog, my blog, me, me, me. But it's also a little bit of you know who you are. There's my puppy. Ther's memes. Whatever lights you up, put it out there. And that creates a daily content as well. So, it doesn't actually take that much time. And it's fun.\
\
[00:32:48.630] - Interviewer\
Okay. No, I like that.\
\
[00:32:50.490] - Interviewer\
Yeah, because marketing is a lot easier to do if you're enjoying.\
\
[00:32:54.990] - Juliette\
I think that it's very important. And I don't know if you heard about human design. It's a little human design. It's all about the energy and the aura and the personality. It's something that is a permission to be you. And for some people, depending on their human design type, my type is a projector, which means I have an aura like this. And I need to project myself. I need to be there. I need to be enjoying myself. If I'm doing something I don't enjoy, I'm going to repel clients.\
\
[00:33:23.610] - Juliette\
I'm going to repel people because somehow on intuitive level, they can feel that. And so, you can. And this is like I testified that you can simplify the way you do your marketing and only do things that you really enjoy or things that you don't mind doing. And you can actually say no to things that feel horrendous to you because there's no one way to get there. And as long as you're enjoying it, that energy will be with your content. And so, it will attract people on that energetic level. And it's absolutely okay to say no.\
\
[00:33:58.710] - Juliette\
So, yeah. Marketing can be absolutely easy. \
\
[00:34:02.670] - Interviewer\
Yes, yes. Okay. So, where can people learn more about you?\
\
[00:34:06.570] - Interviewer\
What can you offer? What's going on?\
\
[00:34:10.110] - Juliette\
Well, guys, the best way to connect to me is look me up on Facebook, look up my personal profile on Facebook. If you want to type it in as Juliet.Stapleton because there's another Stapleton out there, and her name is Juliet, and she's taking my handle on Facebook. But what can you do? So, Juliet.Stapleton or just look me up and sent me a friend request and send me a private message, just say that you watch this talk. And you know, so I will definitely accept you and that's it.\
\
[00:34:39.930] - Juliette\
I'm not going to pitch you anything and just see me walk my talk, because that's what I do on my personal profile. You will see everything in action. I give loads of tips about marketing, how you can be visible how you can be visible without killing yourself or hating what you're doing. And we'll take it from there. If you're going to be interested in anything I do, you will see all the call to actions there, but I think that it would be nice to connect. \
\
[00:35:06.930] - Interviewer\
Yes. Yes. So, we'll definitely include a link to your profile on the page should be below on the right hand side, I think. But, Juliet, thank you so much for being here for joining us and teaching us so much about Facebook.\
\
[00:35:21.150] - Juliette\
Thank you for having me.\

**Transcript:**\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:00:12]:\
Hello. Hello, everybody. I am super excited to share what is working now in my business to make daily sales without social media. And, yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen first. So hi. I am Kate Kordsmeier, your anti guru in business coaching. I'm gonna give you my quick bio here. Essentially, what you need to know about me is that I'm a mom of 2 managing OCD, chronic illness, and running a business that's pulled over 2 and a half million all while working less than 20 hours a week.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:00:50]:\
I launched my wellness blog, Bruton Revel, back in 2015, and I hit my first 6 figure year by 2018 and making over a $193,000 while on my 2 maternity leaves. And then I turned around and sold my blog from multiple 6 figures in 2021. In 2019, I actually launched Success with Soul, which is my business that I still run today. And I actually went without social media. Yeah. I quit all social media in 2021 and my business grew a 165% that next year. I've now worked with over 1200 clients and counting. I'm a certified life and business coach.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:01:32]:\
I've got a woo woo twist. I've got certifications in NLP and hypnotherapy and Reiki. And Success with Soul is really my rebellion against the patriarchy. I my mission is to arm more wonderful humans with fatter wallets and shorter to do lists. So let's get into it. Okay. Today, we're diving into how introverted course creators and bloggers can harness their natural strength to develop sustainable automated daily sales without social media. Okay.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:03]:\
So I know many of\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:04]:\
you are here today because you're a blogger who is probably looking for more ways to grow your audience and monetize with new revenue streams. And maybe some of you\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:13]:\
are here today because you're a coach or\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:15]:\
a course creator who wants to grow their traffic organically without social media and maybe even without paid ads. And I know that for a long time, it was really either or. You were either a blogger or a course creator. But, actually, you're most successful when you bring the 2 together. No selfies required unless you actually feel like it. And so we're gonna get into what this really means and\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:40]:\
what it looks like today. And it all kind of starts with your funnel. So blogging is your ultimate top of funnel.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:49]:\
Someone gets to your site by finding your blog posts, and then you get\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:52]:\
them to opt into your email list through a lead magnet or a freebie, or even just a form that says opt in for, you know, to get emails from me. And we're gonna look at what the back end of that funnel looks like after you've gotten them onto your email list. So it all starts with the back end, which is your automated sales funnel. So the very top of your funnel starts with a lead magnet. Right? This is a valuable freebie that addresses your audience's needs, and you can optimize it for SEO. And this funnel incorporate a low cost tripwire offer to convert those subscribers into customers right away. So here is your top of funnel. It's a lead magnet or some kind of list opt in with a tripwire.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:03:40]:\
The next step of your funnel is automated welcome sequence. Here, we're gonna use authentic story driven content to build trust and seamlessly start introducing your offers to new subscribers. So this is a series that is completely automated. When somebody joins your list, you start mailing them, and you might have anywhere from 3 to 30 emails in this. Start wherever you are. You can start small. But in this, you're introducing them to who you are, what you're about, who you help, how you help them, and you're starting to make actual offers. So, yes, there are going to be some sales emails in your welcome series.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:04:19]:\
The next step of the funnel is more offers with trip wires, bumps, and upsells. So here is where we're going to leverage the quiet power automation to implement strategic sales tactics while focusing on bringing engaging content. So we're gonna go into exactly what this looks like in just a minute, but for now, just know that all of your offers should have some kind of trip wire or pop offer on it, meaning that there is a limited time window, like maybe 15 minutes where they can get a special discount and when they check out their bumps and upsells in order to increase the average order value. The next and last step of this automated sales funnel is an automated evergreen email series. So we already had the welcome series when somebody first joins your list. But after they've been on your list for a while, the way that we continue to have a sustainable low maintenance sales system working for us is by creating a series of emails that goes out potentially for as long as an entire year, and it can continue to nurture your audience and drive sales without the need for that constant high energy interaction. So using this system has allowed me to quit live launching altogether to still make well over 6 figures with my business, working less than 20 hours a week without social media every and making daily sales. Yes.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:05:55]:\
Seriously, I make sales every single day of my offers anywhere from $7 all the way up to $2,000 and everywhere in between, And I'm able to do this by having these email series. So, for example, one of my email series is called Friyay. And on Fridays, every single Friday, they get an email from me. It's all automated with a special discount code and an offer on one of my products. So after I set this up once, I don't have to continue being actively selling every single day, but I am able to continue making sales every single day, especially on Fridays, which are big sales days for me, with this series. And so I started just with 3 emails in this to get me going, and then I tried to add one email a week, basically, until I got to a place where I felt like this was good. At the end of this series, I have my tech set up so that they just pop right back into the start and they go through it all again. This allows me to know that I'm making at least one offer a week to my audience without having to actively show up live and do anything.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:07:08]:\
Perfect for my introverted self. Okay. So next, just kinda wanna dig a little bit deeper into the lead magnet, opt in with a tripwire. So once this is set up, a well crafted tripwire can generate sales automatically, leveraging your thoughtful approach to create offers that resonate deeply with your audience. And this is a really simple yet powerful strategy that allows you to monetize your efforts efficiently, providing a steady stream of income with very minimal ongoing effort. I think this is so great for introverts because one of our strengths is that we can spend a lot of time in deep, thoughtful work. So you can do that to create a valuable lead magnet and then setting up the tech. And by optimizing the lead magnet's landing page with SEO keywords, you can actually even attract organic traffic to build your list effectively.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:08:04]:\
Now putting a tripwire on the end of this is key because tripwires are a perfect match for introverts. They work quietly in the background, convert those leads into customers without the need for constant interaction. Okay. Next up is your automated welcome series. So, again, in this series, you're gonna want to make sure that you're weaving in authentic storytelling, telling your unique story sharing your specific journey because that authenticity resonates and builds trust with your audience. So as you start making offers, they've already got know, like, and trust with you. And when you seamlessly integrate your offers into these automated email sequences, you can really guide your subscribers through a very thoughtful and personalized journey, leading them to your products and services at the right time without overwhelming them. I'd also say that this is a great tool for introverts because you can leverage your natural strength of why introspection to deeply understand your audience's pain points.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:09:07]:\
And then you can address these thoughtfully in your welcome in your welcome sequence. And finally, just to reiterate, you can seamlessly integrate your offers within these series. Even if you're just starting out with a PS, about some of your sales, about some of your products, that's a great way to get started. I also have an email in my welcome series that guides my new subscribers to either my online shop or my everything page, if you're familiar with Lizzie Goddard's everything page concept. Basically, just having a page on your site or having a shop, like I have a Shopify store as well. These are great ways to just, like, send an email letting them know that this exists, and they can peruse what kinds of things that you offer and how you might be able to help them. Okay. So I promised we were gonna look into tripwires, bumps, and upsells a little more.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:10:00]:\
So here's what the tripwire funnel really looks like. So we already talked about it when you have a lead magnet as your opt in, but if you actually have, you can do a trip wire or sometimes it's called a pop offer on a sales page as well. So on that sales page, you might have a little pop up or a banner or something like that that's got a countdown timer. I recommend no more than 15 minutes. And then on that countdown time, you're going to offer them something for a limited time. Right? So you might say something like get 50% off this course for the next 15 minutes, and you'll either give them a coupon code or depending on what your tech stack is, just you'll send them to the checkout page where that price is listed. So they get to the checkout page, and on the checkout page, you'll add something that's called a bump offer. This is, like, on you've probably seen these before.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:11:01]:\
So this is where pull it up. There's, like, a little box on the checkout page to add something. Usually, it's either a checkbox or a toggle button or something like that, And it's usually for a low cost offer, usually somewhere between maybe 7 to $50. And there's no hard and fast rule. It's your business. You can do it however you want, but that's sort of best practice. And this really helps you increase your average order value by giving them an irresistible offer that they can add on to whatever else they're buying. You want it to be something complimentary without being confusing.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:11:40]:\
You don't want it to be too similar to what you're offering. But thinking about who the person is buying your original offer and what else that person might also be interested in. And then after they check out, if you use a tool like Kartra or Thrivecart or Kajabi, all of these tools, my favorite is Kartra, have one click upsell option. So they don't have to input their payment information again. They simply get to the checkout page. They either choose to add the bump offer or not, and after they check out, this is almost like a replacement for the thank you page, and it's going to ask them if they want to add on one more thing to their order. And this the upsell, you can go a lot higher in your price point. You don't have to.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:12:27]:\
All different kinds of things work, but upsells are great places to add on things like coaching or any kind of one on one offer, or maybe it's a larger course that you offer or a way for them to upgrade their order. So if you have all of these in place, then you are going to increase your average order value without lifting a finger, except for the initial set of this. So I now have this on every single one of my products. And I can't tell you how well things convert when somebody is already ready to buy from you. Getting them to add a couple more things is actually quite easy. So after the ones like upsell, there's an option to bring them to a downsell page. If they perhaps didn't take you up on the upsell or you can simply send them to the full thank you page at the end. All right.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:13:18]:\
So part 2 is the front end. So we already looked at the back end with all the tech and systems that I just shared. The front end now is how we actually drive traffic to your sales funnel without social media. You've got your sales funnel here in the center. One of the first strategies I like to go to is guest podcasting and blogging. Appearing in other people's podcasts or writing guest posts really allows you to share your insights deeply, connecting with new audiences in a meaningful way. Perfect for introverts. Number 2 is SEO.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:13:53]:\
Well, SEO stands for search engine optimization and SEO is traditionally thought of as blogging or written content, but it can also include YouTube, Pinterest, podcasting, and traditional blogs. So I think introvert's attention to detail and analytical skills make them great at SEO and you can use keyword research to attract organic traffic to your content without having to start social media. And you can really create blog posts and videos and podcast episodes that reflect your unique voice and expertise. Right up next is ads. So even though you might not be posting on social media, you can do ads through Google, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etcetera. And you can use those targeted ads to drive traffic to your freebies, to low ticket offers. This method is obviously pretty effective and doesn't require constant personal interaction, which is why it feels very different to me than actually posting on social media. Okay.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:14:57]:\
Bundles and summits. Like the one I'm giving this presentation in, bundles and summits are a great way to reach new audiences through collaboration, leveraging collective visibility without constant engagement. It has been one of the best and fastest ways I have grown my email list without ever having to post on social media. Okay. PR and media features. So if you can secure media features like being interviewed or written about, or even guest writing, for magazines, newspapers, big websites. These can all boost your visibility and your credibility and drive traffic without that need for constant presence. And then finally affiliate and collaboration.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:15:42]:\
So affiliates, if you can collaborate with affiliates to promote your, freebies, your offers, you can borrow their audience to grow yours, expanding your reach without that kind of direct content daily effort. This has been one of my favorite ways to collaborate, network, make friends in a way that works for my introverted personality. Okay. One of the last things that I'll share about what's working now is the static 9 grid on Instagram. So y'all probably have, seen, I mentioned already, I quit Instagram in 2021. I haven't posted except one time since then, which was to update my 9 grid, which I did this summer. And this has been an amazing way to still maintain a presence on Instagram so that if somebody goes to search for me and wants to see, is this person legit? What's what are they about? I wanna how many followers did they have? Whoever knows what people are looking for, that they can see I'm a real person. This is how I can help you, but I'm not on social media.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:16:41]:\
And so you can't find me here. Come find me over over in these other places. It's been a huge game changer for my business. And what I just wanna add to this is that I really think that logging off social media might be your key to actually scaling up. And when you really look at it, the ROI of social media just doesn't justify the time spent. Marketers spend 16 hours a week on routine tasks like managing social media, which is over 2 whole workdays. But HubSpot actually found that only 14% of those marketers can attribute a direct ROI to their efforts. So the math just doesn't add up.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:17:21]:\
So I encourage you to track your own ROI if you're curious. How many sales, how much money can you actually attribute to social and compare that to something like your email list. Not to mention the psychological cost of social media, so because somebody especially who already struggles with depression and anxiety, I just have to share this as well, we all know that limiting social media I should say this, but we all know that social media can make us more depressed, more anxious, more lonely, causes a lot of mental health problems. And if you think about mental health as an asset in your business, which I definitely do, social media just starts to look so much less appealing. So I really think that one of the things that could be keeping you stuck is spending time on social media. When you leave, social media brings you maximized focus and productivity, quality over quantity and networking, improve mental health and decision making, ownership of your audience and your platform and your content, and you can create in-depth, long form, sustainable, long shelf life, evergreen content that can work for you for years. So I highly recommend giving yourself a shot with giving up social media. This is one of our other clients, Christina.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:18:36]:\
She said, since since I started working with Kate, I went from making $400 a month to now around $2,500 a month with no social presence. I hate Instagram. So it is not just me. I'm not a fluke. It's not because I had some huge audience before I quit. You can do this too from day 1. I promise you.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:18:56]:\
Okay. So what else is working now? We talked about some of the back end of the funnel. We talked about some of the front end\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:03]:\
of the funnel. And now I actually wanna talk about what\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:05]:\
you're selling in the funnel.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:06]:\
I went from selling one kind of mid tier course to then selling one high ticket group coaching program, and that was all I sold. All roads led there. And then in 2023, what I did is I took my premium program, and I created I evolved into what we're calling, like, an all access pass. And so when you joined Mindful Business Academy, which is what we call our all access pass, you get everything all in one place. So it's not like Mindful Business Academy isn't a course itself. Mindful Business Academy brings together all of our top tier programs and content into one cohesive upgraded experience. So every single course that we sell in the shop, there's a screenshot here showing an example of, like, here's, I think, 6 of the courses that we have in our shop. They're all included in Mindful Business Academy.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:20:01]:\
So it's every single course, every single strategy funnel template training you need, and we're so you're not piecing together random tactics. MBA is a fully integrated system that includes everything I sell all in one powerful, all inclusive package, and best part is it's for one unbeatable price. So if you were to buy all of the pieces a la carte in my shop, you would spend a lot more money than you would if you just buy the all access pass to everything. So it's a discounted, almost like bundle, so to speak. The reason I share this is because breaking it up this way has been really powerful for my business. It's allowed people who want everything in one place, who know they want lots of different courses of mine, who want to go all in. They can do that for a fraction of the price. But for those other people who maybe aren't quite there yet, maybe they feel like, actually, I really just need to work on SEO right now.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:20:58]:\
I don't need all the other pieces. They can just go to the shop and buy whatever they want a la carte, whether that's a mini course or a template or a training. We sell we basically just broke out lots of different pieces of the Mindful Business Academy and now sell them a la carte. So we're really able to meet people where they're at. We have a way that we're able to sell every single day, making daily sales, whether it's for a $9 course or a $200 course or a Mindful Business Academy sale that's normally priced at $2,000. And so this has been a really powerful way to set up kind of our business structure and our offer suite in a way that works for both me and for our people. The great thing about this too is it might look like, oh my gosh. How did you launch 50 products in the shop in 1 year? Well, I didn't.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:21:49]:\
All of these products were already created. So what happened was I was listening to Monica Froese talk about creating a Shopify store, and she was saying how she had all of this content that she had created in various courses and programs over the last 5, 10 years, but it was all gatekept behind this high ticket price. And she felt, man, I can know that there's so much in here that could really help people, but if they're not willing to go all in and spend a couple $1,000, they can't get any of it. And so she just repurposed different pieces of her programs into shop products, and that's exactly what I did. I ended up taking her program actually and how to do a Shopify store and break things apart, but it was a really simple process. And one of the reasons I wanna share it with y'all today is because I bet there are at least a handful of y'all here who have a similar experience. You have a course. You have something that you've created over the years, and what could you take out of that and sell a stand alone a la carte option that helps people get a taste of what it's like to work with you, get some quick wins, and then potentially join your hard ticket program.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:23:01]:\
Okay. So in summary, this funnel is a very low energy, high impact system. This funnel allows for really results oriented engagement without draining your energy. And there's a focus on deep work, we think is a huge strength of ours to create high quality content and those automated sequences and the tech and systems that are happening in the back end. Obviously, it's very sustainable and scalable because once you set it up, this funnel just runs on autopilot, ensuring sustainable growth with minimal ongoing effort. And I think it really focuses on authentic connection and genuine relationships, writing through those well crafted introspective content that you produce and resonates really deeply with your audience. So what feels better to you? Here is a little chart that I created here, where we have your return on investment. So how much does it actually work to get you clients and the energy required? You'll see what I consider to be one of the worst ways to market your business is constant social media.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:24:06]:\
It's a lot of energy, both in terms of time, commitment and thought and wondering, what am I gonna post? How am I gonna post? Should be a post? All of those types of things. Right? So it's constant daily work and it has a very little ROI. The people I know that are getting any kind of ROI are constantly posting multiple stories, reels, etcetera, per day. And I don't know about you, but as an introvert, especially I have no interest in being glued to my phone all day. Likewise, live launching is another one. Now live launching does have a general pretty good return on investment when you do it. Right. However, it requires a lot of energy, right? So these are kind of two ends of the high energy spectrum.\
\
Kate Kordsmeier [00:24:55]:\
Whereas on the flip side, something that requires literally no ongoing energy from you are things like trip wires and upsells and evergreen email sequences. And they have a very high return on investment. Again, some of the other things we talked about. Bundles at summits, affiliate collaborations, SEO, PR and media features. These kind of fall over here in the high return on investment and lower energy required. Whereas some things in the middle, like personalized outreach, live webinars and sales pitches, constant networking events definitely require a lot more energy. So which one feels better to you? This system or this system? I personally want low energy, high impact strategies. And just when you compare it to the traditional high energy sales tactics, oh, it's just exhausting for introverts.\

Kate Kordsmeier [00:25:53]:\
So in contrast, this funnel really allows for thoughtful pre planned engagement that leverages our strength and reduces the need for constant live interaction.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Guys, I'm excited for this session with Kelly from Freedom in a Budget. Kelly, welcome, and thank you for doing this.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:00:05]:\
Thank you for having me. I'm excited.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:07]:\
Yeah. Because we're gonna be talking about YouTube Mhmm. For people that are really just starting to dip their toys in the water. Can you give us a little bit about your background and sort of what what we're gonna learn today?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:00:20]:\
Yeah. I had no YouTube background when I started. I hadn't didn't know how to turn on my camera. In fact, I used my phone, for about 3 years up until I hit 20,000 subscribers, and I finally upgraded to a camera, but I didn't know how to edit. I didn't know how to do thumbnails. I didn't know how to do graphics. I didn't know how to do anything, and I just learned through trial and error. I've been on YouTube for almost 4 years now.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:46]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:00:46]:\
It'll be 4 years in April. So I've learned a lot of the things to do and the things not to do. So, hopefully, we can kinda work on the things to do, and you don't have to go through all the struggles that I did.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:58]:\
Yes. Yes. It's a lot of I feel like a lot of times when we're Blogger giving, like, advice for, like, and here's the the mistake I made, avoid it. Yeah. Please.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:01:08]:\
Yes. Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:10]:\
Yeah. Because you you've you've been on YouTube over 4 years. You've got over 20,000. How many I mean, I forgot how many you have.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:01:16]:\
Now, I think I'm at 32,000.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:18]:\
Yeah. Which is I mean, that's like half of a football stadium. That's a lot of people. Maybe more anyway. But yeah. So really excited to learn from you. I kinda dipped my toes in water and still not you know, I'm still learning because I haven't been consistent. So can you let's maybe start with sort of what are the elements of a YouTube channel? Talk about videos and editing, you know, thumbnails, and there's cards and tags.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:49]:\
You know, so let's kinda start with, like, breaking down. You've started the channel, which all you need is your email address. You maybe named it. What do you do next?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:01:58]:\
First thing, and this is, like tip number 1 that seems so basic, but I have clients that will talk me like, alright, I'm gonna go film videos, and then they film videos like this, like you would on Instagram stories, but you have to film them horizontal. You need to do everything in landscape mode. That is, like, rule number 1 because, otherwise, you're gonna have the ugly black bars made to either side. Okay. So that's that's number 1. Then just parts of YouTube is, so you have your thumbnail, you have your actual video, you have your title. You always wanna make sure that you're thinking of your title and your thumbnail before you even start thinking about your video and filming your video because you want to have that incorporated all into it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:41]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:02:42]:\
Then you have your description, which is how you can help yourself to rank in SEO. It helps your promote your video. It helps you kind of explain what's going on the video. If you have links that go with the video, like affiliate marketing links, then you can put those in as well. And your disclosure? And your disclosure. Yes. Definitely. Disclosure.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:03:02]:\
Your disclosure, social media links, all of that. Then you have your tags, and tags are also what's gonna help with ranking in SEO. And I have some strategies that I can help with you guys with that as well. Then you have end screens, which are a great way to to promote your next video and keep them on the viewing session. That's huge in YouTube is you wanna keep people on the platform, and the best way to do that is to keep them on your videos so that they're not clicking on other people. So you can use that with end screens and some strategies with that. I cards, I don't usually use I cards too much anymore. They're kind of going out of kind of style on YouTube.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:03:44]:\
But Okay. The basics.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:47]:\
Okay. So that's the basics, and I I wanted to get into those a little bit more. But, so that's resharing with your videos. But there's things you need to you you should probably do on your channel. Right? Is there there's, like, an about section. Mhmm. And what extent should you be doing that, having, like, a background image for your channel header? You know? Mhmm. Where you know, to what extent do you need to do that, and what should you be doing?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:04:12]:\
Yeah. You definitely want to, you know, create an about section. You want to and that can just be a quick little bio, and it can change over time. Yeah. When I started\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:23]:\
Sorry. That's okay. Would it be similar to, like, the about page on your blog? But\
\
Kelly Smith [00:04:27]:\
Yes. Yep. Just kind of explaining your story, what your channel is all about, why you started on YouTube maybe, whatever it may be, and then as your channel changes and progresses because most likely it will, most likely you're gonna pivot at some point, then you can change you can update it. It's not set in stone. And then your channel banner, your profile picture, that's all part of it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:49]:\
Do you recommend your profile picture and banner, either or, having your face versus your logo? What's your\
\
Kelly Smith [00:04:56]:\
That's a personal decision. I personally use my face. I like that. I don't know. I just feel like it's more personal, especially, you know, down in the comments section that they can kind of put a face to face to a name and just kind of see that I am a real person and not, you know, a robot, especially when you get into comments of people just being people on the Internet and typing comments. It can be like, oh, this girl, she knows what she's talking about. She's legit.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:22]:\
Nice. Okay. So let's get back to some of the other things you had mentioned. Is there do you have any sort of strategies in deciding on a title? Have you found that certain titles do well for big news?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:05:37]:\
Yeah. You have to you know, it's all SEO, and I've definitely gotten better at it than when I first started. I didn't even know what SEO was, and so it's definitely, you know, learning what you're gonna rank for, learning how to pick terms that aren't gonna be too competitive. There are tools like TubeBuddy, and I'll have that in my freebie, a discount for you guys. But TubeBuddy is an awesome tool that'll help tell you where you're ranking in these search terms, and also give you suggested ones. So you may not rank in this one, but try this one, and then it also will give you keywords to put in your description, to put in the first three minutes of your video. You wanna have a lot of keywords, because the AI of Google, they listen to our videos, they know what we're saying, and so that's another way that they can rank you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:28]:\
Okay. So it's not just ranking in YouTube, but ranking in Google as well.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:06:32]:\
Oh, yeah. Mhmm.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:33]:\
Okay. Yeah. And I think we've all seen that when we use Google and there's, like, videos that pop. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Good to know. Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:41]:\
So so the title, it's it's digging into TubeBuddy. It's, you know, phrasing it in a way that creates interest, I would assume. Mhmm. Yeah. Or that answers the question that they're looking Yep. Is the same sort of thing go for tags? How do you are tags more than one word? Are they how do you like, kind of, how many tags to do and what they look like?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:07:05]:\
1st is I always tag my channel. That's that's always one of them, is, freedom in a budget is always a tag just because it links it, you know, when people are searching, I'm coming up. And then just other keywords you wanna do, whether they be, you know, you want them in the general area of, you know, how to pay off debt, debt payoff strategies, how to pay off debt fast, easy ways to pay off debt, budget burnout, like, all those different keywords that you can do that are along the same things if people are searching for it, they're gonna find your video. Okay. You can have up to 500 characters worth.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:45]:\
Okay. So do you normally max out those 500 characters?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:07:49]:\
Oh, yeah. Mhmm. Yep.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:52]:\
Okay. Good to know. As close as possible. Yeah. As close as possible. And this is probably super basic, but I could see people getting tripped up with it because hashtags are on, like, every other platform, but you don't do hashtags on YouTube. Correct?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:08:07]:\
Not they're they do have that thing that they started a couple months ago where you can put hashtag, and then I think up to 3 hashtags will show up right above your title on it, but I don't it doesn't really do much for SEO. It does give a little bit of credibility to people that don't understand how it works where they're almost, like, seeing as, woah, they ranked in this hashtag for it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:31]:\
Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:08:31]:\
But other than that, you don't use hashtags.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:34]:\
Okay. So it's not something to really have to worry about as much when it comes to No. Okay. And then the description, you know, we are doing you mentioned you're doing social media, you're doing your exposure, affiliate links, stuff like that. Are you you know, if you're doing, like, a video that's tied to a blog post, are you pulling in part of the content of the post? You're maxing out the description. What's what's that look like?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:08:58]:\
I don't necessarily max it out, but I do like to have a paragraph or 2 of what the video is on, with the links, you know, any links that go with it. If I'm talking, you know, have an affiliate link with it, or even related videos, you know. Sometimes people wanna see other videos that are along the same topic, then they'll look in the description. And always tell people to go to the description as well. Or if you're talking about something, say the links below in the description. Go check them out. Okay. That's helpful too.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:30]:\
Okay. And then I'm looking at this. My so another because this is this is, Liz Fail. When I first the very first time I, like, was trying to do YouTube, I was putting together this massive GDPR guide\
\
Kelly Smith [00:09:43]:\
back in\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:44]:\
2018, and I had videos for certain parts, but I didn't know you could schedule that. Yes. And so I was like, the post isn't done yet, but I need the video to be in the post, and it was like catch 22. Yep. Schedule them. You can there's a lot to I feel like there's other options there as well. So do you how much do you work in advance? How much do you schedule? How much do you just do? Sometimes it's just like, nope. Publish.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:07]:\
We're good. Like, what does that look like? What do you think works best?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:10:11]:\
I always schedule. Always personally schedule. Well, I take that back, unless I'm working with a brand, that's the only time I don't schedule. I'll have it as unlisted, and then I'll give them the link to it. Okay. And some because sometimes they need approval or they need things tweaked or anything, but that's, you know, that's more just working with brands. Yeah. With scheduling, I because you wanna have a set time and day that you're you're gonna be uploading, you know, whether it be one day a week, 2 days a week, 3 days, whatever it is.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:10:43]:\
You wanna have that consistency just like a TV show. So that's why I personally don't just upload whenever or, you know, just publish whenever. I always have it scheduled even if it's, like, for tomorrow morning, or I finish editing right before, and it's, you know, even 5 minutes before, I'll I'll schedule that out. So it goes at that set time.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:04]:\
Okay. Are is there like a certain time that's best to publish videos or\
\
Kelly Smith [00:11:11]:\
You really just wanna look at your own analytics and kind of test it out. Test the waters out, especially in the beginning. I in the beginning, it's it's very experimental and it's very okay. What's gonna work? What thumbnails work? What how long of videos do people like? What what topics do people like? And you can play around with the times, especially in the beginning, And there's analytics where you can see the real time view. So you can see for the last 48 hours, when are your peaks? When are people watching a lot? And then if it's 10 AM, okay, 10 AM is when I post. I personally post early in the morning, and I had people say that you're part of my morning routine, which was, like, the biggest compliment ever. Yeah. A lot of gamers, they post in the evening or, like, 5 o'clock.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:11:57]:\
Like, my husband was like, why don't you post till like 5 PM? That's when everyone posts. I was like, that's when everyone posts in your niche, what you watch, not not my niche. So it may be different, you know, for different people across the board. YouTube is not the same for everyone by any means.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:10]:\
Gotcha. Okay. So looking definitely look at your analytics. And, I mean so question though, if you're just getting started, you probably don't have a lot of analytical data.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:12:21]:\
Mhmm.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:21]:\
So how long does it take you to kind of I mean, if you're being consistent, right, at least once a week, maybe at different times or different days, right, because you're trying to figure it out. How long would you say before you kind of zero in? Or how many views? Or how you know, what amount of data do you need to start making those decisions, I guess?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:12:38]:\
I would say probably probably about 20 to 30 videos\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:43]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:12:44]:\
Is what I would say, and I always recommend not to pivot the conversation, but I always recommend people to get enough videos up that are binge worthy. So if I'm going to your channel, I wanna be able to go and spend an hour at least on your channel and watch a bunch of videos. I don't wanna go to your channel and see one video and be, like, I'm not even, like, it's not even worth it to me, or you watch it and then you forget about it. But if someone comes to my channel and watches 4 videos, that's also gonna trigger the algorithm. Even if they're not subscribed to me, it's still gonna trigger the algorithm so that they pop up again and again and again.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:22]:\
YouTube's creepy like that.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:13:23]:\
Yeah. Yeah. And, leaving comments. Like, I always tell people to leave every single video that you watch, leave a comment on it. Make sure it's a a meaningful comment, make sure it's not a spam, like don't say, I have a video on this too. Don't say, I have a channel too, but say, that was a great point that, you know, I learned a lot from that, or I found this to be the case, or, you know, always make sure that it's\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:50]:\
Starting a dialogue or a compliment.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:13:52]:\
Yeah. Always like it's always always remember that it's representing your brand. So even if it's, like, there's nothing nice to say about the video, find something to say. Like, even if it's, I think that's a cute shirt. I love your shirt. Something like that, but you never wanna put them down because what about the other people in the comments and they see it? That's gonna look bad on you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:12]:\
Your question negative Nancy.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:14:14]:\
Exactly. They're gonna see you as, like, oh, that girl's a jerk. Like, I do not wanna watch her videos. Whereas, if you say something, like, super meaningful or very helpful without trying to take away from the video and make you look like the superstar, you know, you wanna do it tactfully. Yeah. It's gonna be\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:30]:\
like question if it's\
\
Kelly Smith [00:14:31]:\
Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then they can be like, woah, that girl knows what she's talking about. Then when they go to your channel, you wanna have enough that they binge.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:40]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:14:41]:\
Have enough. So once you start getting, you know, 6 to 20 videos up, then start just going comment hog wild. Every time you watch a video, comment on it to get yourself out there and start, start getting your name out there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:57]:\
Okay. Yeah. Now I'm, like, getting ideas for videos. Okay. So we've kinda touched on the elements of a YouTube channel and the elements of post video. I feel like we started dive into just the elements of YouTube. Mhmm. There is a lot to it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:13]:\
Can can we talk a little bit more about your sort of strategies for end screens and and just yeah. Let let's start there.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:15:22]:\
This is a good one. This is one that I actually learned in the past 6 months, and it has been a game changer for my channel. Game changer. I've seen so much growth from it in the past 6 months, it's incredible. So, what I started doing is, say my video has 5 points, you know, 5 talking points or 5 tips to do this, whatever it is. At the I don't say couple of things. I don't say, in the last point is blah blah blah blah. I give I just say the next point is it's always the next point, the next point, or sometimes I'll number them like number 5 or whatever.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:15:57]:\
Never say the last point. Because once you say last point, books are closed, they're checking out,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:01]:\
you\
\
Kelly Smith [00:16:01]:\
know, just like in school or whatever.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:03]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:16:04]:\
So then when I give the next the last point and I finish it, I sit I go into a pre planned video plug. Okay. So when I'm writing my script, I think of a video that would be helpful. Okay. So, I say let's say I'm talking about paying off debt, and my next video that I wanna plug is how to stop living paycheck to paycheck. So finish up my point blah blah blah, and I said, we're gonna keep the conversation going. I'm gonna give you tons of tips on how to set a living paycheck to paycheck, how to break that cycle. I used to do it, all the tips and everything, and I'll see you in that video.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:16:39]:\
Close, end screen. Oh. You don't say, bye. You don't say, thank you for watching. You don't you leave them like, woah, woah, woah, what the heck? I wasn't done watching, like, what do you mean, Kelly? Like, no. I don't I don't want this\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:51]:\
The open loop you're creating where they have to go to the next video.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:16:54]:\
Correct. So then it forces them to do it. And to get even better, you can link that specific video, but within a playlist. So if you have a playlist with it, then you can click on the playlist, click that specific video link, and put that as the end screen.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:13]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:17:14]:\
So that way, when they click on it, it's they're already in a playlist, they're in a loop, they're they're sucked in, they can't they can't stop.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:20]:\
Yeah. You they've gone down the YouTube rabbit hole.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:17:23]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:23]:\
Like, you know, for me, because I do that at night and I'm like, oh, shit. I meant to go to bed, like, a half hour ago unless I'm, like, staring at my phone.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:17:31]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:31]:\
And it started, like, an hour ago, hour and a half. You know? Yep. It's that little rabbit hole. Okay. No. That's that's great. So what, because, you know, I think you said it took you about 3 years to get to 20,000, but then, like, another year you've already gotten 25%. So kind of what strategies have you seen to, like, help that grow, and what does it mean to have more subscribers? Like, obviously, there's the whole you need a 1,000 subscribers and a certain amount\
\
Kelly Smith [00:17:58]:\
of\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:59]:\
time to monetize. And if you want to talk about getting to that point and things that help you get there, and then if we can talk about what helped you get, you know, the next Yeah. How'd you how'd you get that first 1,000? How what did that look like? What's your\
\
Kelly Smith [00:18:11]:\
I was actually grandfathered in, so I didn't have to meet the monetization rules. If I if I wasn't already at that point, then I would have to qualify for it. But I was already at that point when they've hit those new rules.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:18:24]:\
But for people now starting, you need a 1000 subscribers k. And 4000 hours of watch time.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:32]:\
Okay.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:18:32]:\
So, now that can be a lot. I have a lot of friends that have hit the 1,000 subscribers and then they have like half of the watch time. So it's, you know, getting that watch time up it can be tricky, and then growing. A big thing is niching down. Okay. I personally was in 2 different niches and I tried to make it work and I tried to convince myself that they intertwined and it was okay, And I was like, Kelly, nope. You got a niche down. You got a niche down.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:19:00]:\
And I was like, y'all say this, but I don't believe it and I've seen this person that's successful Stapleton does it, and this person is successful, and yes, there may be those unicorns out there\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:10]:\
Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:19:11]:\
That can do it and have multiple niches. But for me, personally, when I decided to finally niche down, that's when I took off, and that's when I exploded. And so I\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:21]:\
was like Having a clear focus with your Yeah. Gotcha.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:19:26]:\
Yep. That's huge. And if you wanna go broader as you get bigger, then you can definitely do that as well. You know?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:\
Out. Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:19:34]:\
Yeah. If you like, you know, Graham Stephan, he just hit 1000000 subscribers. He could probably talk about whatever the heck he wants to right now, and he would still get 200,000 views on a video, but, you know, he didn't do that at 10,000 subscribers. You know, like, he you had to get bigger, and then you can kinda branch out a little bit more into, like, the lifestyle, the vlogging, all of that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:58]:\
Okay. Yeah. And so, what did you so you I feel like you're right. Like, the subscriber bit is not as hard to hit necessarily. Mhmm. How do you get those watch time hours? Like, anything you would suggest to kind of you know, if you're if you got the subscribers and you're trying to get the watch time hours, what would you do publish more? Are your videos longer? Like, what do you do?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:20:22]:\
Really just getting into that loop of, you know, getting people to keep on watching. And also, when you do get the analytics, when you do have enough data for it, watch your audience retention. Where are the graphs? Where are people dropping off? And then go back and look at what they did to drop off at that time. And then I don't really typically do use cards anymore, but if I do have a drop off where all of a sudden it's like, and then goes down, I'll put an Icard right before that to keep them on the platform. So that way, if they're right about to drop off, then I'm gonna try and get something to trigger them to keep watching another video of mine. But audience retention, if you can really hone in on how to keep your audience, their attention what they want, then they're gonna keep on watching. And if you can study that and study what they're going off off to or, you know, off to another video, then you can really hone in. Live streams are another great one.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:21:22]:\
I just had a live stream stream last night with one of my friends who was trying to get his watch time up. So, we had 4 of us on the live stream and, you know, it's just another way. To I think he got 17 hours worth of worth of watch time, which, you know, it doesn't seem like a lot, but\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:38]:\
It adds up.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:21:39]:\
Yeah. It adds up. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:40]:\
Yeah. Mhmm. But I used to I mean, YouTube has changed its, like, its stuff. Because I used to run my webinars using a YouTube live Mhmm. link, and, like, you can't do that now. It's it changed. It's annoying. But I get so much, like, watch time.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:53]:\
I was like, oh. I was like, that's really just for my webinar. But, but, yeah, I know. That's a great point is doing lives because I think people are, you know maybe initially, like, doing a live was intimidating, but, like, people do it on Instagram. They do it on Facebook. Like, you could just do the YouTube live too.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:22:10]:\
And if you're gonna do it, have topic ready, have questions ready, maybe, you know, pull your Instagram for questions or know know what you're gonna go in on, You know, because there may be dull silences. We can just talk where you can just be like, okay, and then next we're gonna talk about this topic and this is what I found for that. Because a lot of them they were like, alright, leave your questions in the comments and we'll be through. And then\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:30]:\
you're standing there like twiddling your thumbs waiting for questions. Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:22:33]:\
It's so awkward. Yeah. And you may have 5 people in your 1st live stream, but, you know, that's okay. Those 5 people, it's gonna mean so much to them. And then I'm able to get that 1 on 1 attention and that's gonna make them a super fan. You know, they were the you'll be from the beginning. You gave them that undivided attention. They're gonna love that.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:22:49]:\
So don't take it as bad if you only have a few people in your livestream. You should be like\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:54]:\
More than you had before. Exactly.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:22:57]:\
And be like, alright. Have the mindset of, alright. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna keep them. I'm going to make them a super fan. I'm gonna treat them with the white glove service. Yeah. And I want to make them, you know, trust me, think the world of me.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:12]:\
Tell everyone about me, you know?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:23:13]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:\
Mhmm. Yeah. Because if you think about, like, 5 people, it doesn't seem like much. But if you do, like, a 20 minute live, that's over that's, like, an hour and 40 minutes watch time.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:23:23]:\
Mhmm.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:23]:\
You know? So Yeah. That's every every every person counts. Yep. And treat them that way. Treat them like people. Treat them like your people. Yeah. So my next question, or something I'd like to talk about is sort of video content.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:40]:\
Right?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:23:40]:\
Mhmm.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:40]:\
Because some people, they just talk to a camera. Some people, it's like doing a present. What do you think works best? I know it's gonna vary by niche depending on what you're doing. Like, obviously, makeup tutorial or, like, a nail you know, that's, like, clearly Mhmm. But, you know, you're in the personal finance space or someone who's in, you know, other things. What sort of approach do you think how should you figure out what approach to take with the video? Because some people aren't comfortable in front camera.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:24:05]:\
Yeah. Well, first talking about getting comfortable in front of a camera. One thing that I always recommend people to do and you're gonna feel like an idiot, but is go around and vlog around your house while you're cooking dinner, while you're cooking. Be like, alright guys, I'm cooking dinner blah blah blah and this is the ingredient, like, you're gonna feel like an idiot, but it's gonna get you comfortable talking. It's gonna get you comfortable looking at the lens and not yourself. That is huge. Because if people are like, she's just looking at herself the whole time. Why am I even here? You know, she conceded.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:24:39]:\
Like, people are crazy on the Internet. They just go to the worst. Yeah. But it's just gonna get you used to talking on camera. I look back to my old videos and I said, every three words. Yep. And so just getting used to that is huge. And it all also depends on, you know, how comfortable you are with different camera angles and use of camera, like, different shots are really important.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:25:05]:\
I personally do talking head, so I just do one head on. I don't have the multi camera setup. Mhmm. I don't vlog in my typical video. Sometimes I'll use some b roll, but I keep it pretty basic. But I am trying to up my game, you know, as I'm saying this.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:23]:\
So We all are. If you don't look at your first videos, you know, later on and cringe, like, you clearly you waited too long. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Okay. So speaking so do do you wanna touch on what b roll is? Because you did mention it. I wanna make sure\
\
Kelly Smith [00:25:38]:\
you put the\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:39]:\
name and the term. And what it is and how you would use it?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:25:42]:\
Yeah. So b roll is just when you're watching a video and something comes across the screen or something pops up and it's like a video playing, that kinda emphasizes the topic of what you're doing. So if you're talking about, I don't know, a beach vacation or you talk about a a trip that you took and discussing it or how much cost whatever it may be. You may have a video come up on screen of the beach of you and your kids playing of whatever it may be, and just building that visual. So, it's help helping to keep them engaged in the video, because if it's just your straight head the whole time, they can get bored with that. So it was just kind of keeping them visually impaired or sometimes I'll do little pop ups of different things to kind of emphasize the point, maybe what I'm talking about and having the words on the screen so that it really hones in the point. They can read it almost like a slide type of thing.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:33]:\
Okay. And then I kinda wanted to ask, what are you using to edit? How do you go about editing? How do you go about learning to edit? Right? Because sound is super important. You know? Share wisdom, please.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:26:49]:\
So when I first started Okay. I only we're gonna get into story time. I only trimmed the first, like, the beginning and end of each video on my iPhone, and when you go into edit video on iPhone, like, just hitting the edit button, there's like this little bar they can move, but if you move it too much, it goes too far, and then if it goes and we would be driving their church, like, oh, crap. I went too far. Oh, I missed a spot, and it would take me 20 minutes to get the little ticker in the exact spot.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:19]:\
Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:27:19]:\
So I've definitely upgraded my editing from there. Now I personally use Final Cut Pro, which is about $300 investment. Imovie, if you have a Mac, Imovie pre installed. It's free. That's a great option. Premiere Pro is also another great option that's a little bit more of a step up as well.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:39]:\
You just use YouTube to learn how to use those tools?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:27:42]:\
YouTube University. Yeah. There are so many blog posts and so many videos. There's still I only know, like, maybe 40% of all that final cut can do, if that. There's still stuff that I'm learning every day and there's still stuff that I go to Google or look up on YouTube of how do I do this? How do I change that setting? Or I'm I'm having this problem. What do I do for it? So the YouTube's your best friend for that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:07]:\
Yeah. Yeah. And there's, you know, like you say, you don't have to necessarily spend $300 on Mhmm. Editing software or even a camera to start out. You use your phone for several years. Phones have great cameras on them.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:28:17]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:17]:\
You know? So Mhmm. Don't afraid to do that. What do you ever you know, because people know a lot I I know a lot of people are like, I wanna make sure I have everything before I start, but you don't need to. No. Go. But, is there, like, lighting kit or microphone? Do you use a microphone? Is that super important? Do you just use the computer microphone? Like, because sound is really important when it comes to video and no one wants to listen to a video with terrible sound.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:28:44]:\
Oh, yeah. Audio is so important. Audio is way more important than lighting. Audio is a game changer. If it's crappy audio, you can barely hear it. If there's too loud of a if there's background noise, whatever it may be, they're static, people are just gonna click off. You're, like, you're gonna get 2 seconds at them and they're gonna be like, see you. I'm out.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:29:06]:\
It's very important. I do have a resource list that I'll have for you guys with all of the stuff that I use. I have it from the beginning when I first started my channel and how I've upgraded, so there's totally different price points Yeah. In it. And you can you can have fun with the the lighting and everything, and, you know, I started doing backlighting and working on different camera angles and stuff. So it can it can get to be fun.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:32]:\
Okay. I like that. Yeah. And then any I mean, I feel like we've kinda covered the basics. I feel like we've done YouTube 101, getting started on YouTube. Any additional tips or advice you have for people that are are really just getting started or all they've done is, like, set up the channel name, you know?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:29:54]:\
Now, this one it's kind of contradictory. Okay. But in the beginning, it's your videos, unless you're like have an editing background, a film background, or anything like that, most likely they will be embarrassing and that's totally fine. If you go back to Freedom and Budget, it's it's bad. It's bad. All the ones from 2016, but with that being said, say a video goes viral, make sure it's not too embarrassing. So you wanna make sure that it's still, like, you would still be proud of the video. Never just rush videos just to throw them up.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:30:31]:\
I did that. I did 5 videos a week for over 2 years. And I'll be honest, a lot of the videos sucked and people kept on telling me, Kelly, but if you up your quality then then it will be better and be like, what do you say about my quality? But, yeah, let's be honest. You know, it wasn't good. A lot of the videos were, but some of them were, but not all of them. I was just throwing whatever I could because I was trying to get watch time. I was trying to get whereas when I, like, took back some videos, I ended up getting more views because it was a content overload.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:03]:\
Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:31:03]:\
So with that being said, make sure that you'd be proud of it. Like, for instance, my top video, I mess up the intro and then just keep on going. Like, I didn't even I didn't even edit it out because I wasn't editing at that time. I was just trimming either end of the video. Yeah. And it's embarrassing, and so I don't I've thought about taking it down, but at the same time I'm getting comments that this was so helpful. This really helped me, and I'm afraid\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:31]:\
that that would be perfect. Yeah.\
\
Kelly Smith [00:31:33]:\
Right, but at the same time, I don't want people to look at a video and think that that's what my channel is like. That's the quality of my channel and being like, okay. Yeah. That may have been helpful, but I'm done. Like, this isn't this isn't for me. So just, kind of, with that being said, make sure that you'd be proud of any video that you put out with the intention of what if it goes viral? Like, that's gonna be their first impression of you, and you can't redo that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:57]:\
Yeah. Okay. No. That I think that's a great point. And I know, you know, you've touched on it, but you do have something free for all the attendees, and the link is below what you wanna tell us about\
\
Kelly Smith [00:32:07]:\
it. Yeah. I just have a a super quick printable for you guys with just some basic tips, a checklist for you guys, What I use, what tools I use like TubeBuddy, a discount link for that, my gear, just basic basic stuff that you can just print out that you know exactly what you need to hit for each thing.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:26]:\
That's awesome. Thank you. And I think for people, like, at the All Access Pass, you're also offering a special discount. So Yes. You guys wanna be able to rewatch this session forever and also get access to this discount and a bunch of other stuff for the All Access Pass. Definitely get that. Can you tell us about what you're what you're doing for All Access Pass holders?\
\
Kelly Smith [00:32:43]:\
Yeah. I do YouTube coaching, so you guys can ask me questions, what whatever it may be, and just kinda coach you along in the process. So I'm actually offering 50% off for everyone that is part of this.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:56]:\
That is that's big. So, definitely, guys, if YouTube is something you really wanna focus on, get the All Access Pass, check it out. You know, fifty percent's nothing to sneeze at. That is a big discount. So thank you so much for your generosity there\

**Transcript:**\
Krista Miller [00:00:12]:\
Hey there. Welcome to the training on how to fill your funnel with leads at launcher course through a high converting virtual summit. This is gonna be a lot of fun, and we're just gonna dive right on in here. And don't worry. You're not gonna have to sit through, like, a 15 minute long or really dramatic story of my life, but I do wanna use this one slide to just tell you a little bit about why I'm so passionate about this topic. And I actually started out hating virtual summits because of just how slimy and gross they were, and I very distinctly remember complaining about them in a mastermind I was in back in 2016, when one of the members had guessed that they were gonna become a big deal that year, and they did, but my views on them obviously changed, and I came up with my own slime free system in 2017. And since then, I posted summits ranging from small 500 attendee events to producing larger 14,000 attendee events, a single event of my own has brought in up to a $121,000 in sales, just from the summit itself, not including a launch, and I've honestly learned so much both from the successes and the failures and every event I host is a chance for me to learn more and pass it along, but everything I've learned so far has has led me to my signature summit hosting framework. And then once I had that baseline framework down after the first few events, I experimented with launching, a course through a summit in 2020 and hit my biggest launch ever at the time, And that success led me to walking through the same process with clients to see if it would work and translate for them, and it did.\
\
Krista Miller [00:01:42]:\
We've brought in more record breaking results, and I've created our signature summit to course launch system to teach you how to do the same thing, and it's the reason we're here today, of course. So if you're here, I would guess that you have an incredible course that sells, but you need more people to sell it to, which is such a common problem. Right? It's funny we go through so much work to create our courses, and we think that's the hard part, but then we get the thing created and we're like, dang. Now I gotta, like, consistently find people who want to buy this. So, before we get into the 4 key steps that we're gonna talk about, I wanna just kinda set the stage a little bit to help you become aware of what you might be doing right now versus where we want to get you through a summit, so it all kinda makes more sense. So right now, you're struggling or at least hustling to generate enough leads for your course to hit the goals you set. You're spending too much time, bringing in leads with too little return on that investment with these slow growth strategies that just aren't cutting it and not cutting it consistently at least. And I know how frustrating that is.\
\
Krista Miller [00:02:40]:\
Your calendar is full of things that you know should be making a difference, at least according to what other people say. Right? But it it's just not cutting it. Things like creating content, engaging on social media, doing podcast tours, and those things that we know are worthwhile in the long run. I'm not saying those things don't work. I'm saying that you might get to the point where you're like, I need something that works right now. You might be at a point where you're seeing diminishing returns on your current launch or list building strategies, like maybe Facebook ads, and you're ready to try something new and more effective, and I poked up Facebook ads there, but I know there's so many different launch strategies out there, email sequences, webinars, challenges, and those things are great. I do all of those things myself, but sometimes you just find that you need to kick it up a notch because you wanna sell more of your course without constantly piling on more strategies in order to in order to scale, because that's not how it's supposed to work. We're not supposed to have to work way harder each time we want to increase our goals.\
\
Krista Miller [00:03:38]:\
So if you're someone who's tried most of these things from content marketing to challenges to networking and all other things listed there, but you find that nothing is generating the leads you need to hit your launch goals consistently, just know that you're not alone in that, okay, plus once you get those leads in the door, you're still not done. After that, you're you're doing additional things like challenges, webinars, video series, and email launches to convert those leads in into sales. And you do get sales each time, which is wonderful, but you're ready for bigger, better, more momentum filled launches and consistent evergreen sales as well. And this ties back, you know, just to the fact that a lot of the strategies that you might actually be using as, like, ways that you're trying to build an audience are actually designed as launch mechanisms. Okay. So if you're going out and you're hosting webinars, and part of your goal with that is to build an audience, that's just how it works. Okay. You need something much more effective, and this is where the power of a summit comes in.\
\
Krista Miller [00:04:41]:\
If you wanna combine all of those strategies with one thing that can do it all at once, a summit is what you're looking for and you are in the right place with this presentation. So let's dive in. You know, of course, I'll be talking about the 4 keys that you fill your funnel with leads and launch through a summit, but we're also gonna touch on things like how to have summit attendees, like, begging for you to open the cart to your course, which, you know, that never gets old. Right? We'll talk about the number one thing that can make or break your summit results, and then we will cover the biggest mistakes summit host make that lead to, 0 or very few course sales. So now that you have some context, you know, you kind of have an idea of why I care about this so much. Let's go ahead and dive into these 4 keys. So first up, the first key is, of course, the summit. The high converting summit you'll host is what kicks off the entire process and it's what draws those leads in to fill your funnel with.\
\
Krista Miller [00:05:32]:\
So typically this is gonna be a 3 to 5 day engaging online event with a group of speaker presentations, based around a specific topic that your audience wants. And if your goal is to go in and launch your offer through the summit, I would lean more on a shorter, shorter time frame. When I say the 3 to 5 day range there, I'd I'd go towards the the shorter end of that. So why is this part, this first key so important? Obviously, you can't host a summit without a summit, but I want you to see the power of a summit done the right way. It connects you with speakers who become affiliates and help drive traffic to your event. Because of that, the size of your audience doesn't matter because your speakers are helping you bring that audience. From there, you'll nurture the audience through your summit with engagement based strategies, which established that established the know, like, trust factor way faster than other lead generation methods you're used to using and at the same time, you're able to build desire for your offer while creating a transformation for attendees that they're excited to continue with once the event is over and that is powerful. And I know I I just said a lot of words right but in case you didn't notice I wanna give you a visual too your summit is a full funnel that's what I just went over from lead generation to launch built into one event and condensed into a small, very high impact time frame.\
\
Krista Miller [00:06:50]:\
And we have a full episode all about how a summit is a full funnel on the summit host hangout podcast, so be sure to check that out if you haven't. But in this process, you're connecting with speakers who drive a cold audience, getting those people on your list, building trust by getting them engaged, helping them make progress to the Summit, also reengaging your existing audience, you're introducing all these people to your offer, getting the first purchase out of the way with the all access pass, and then making your offer, all at once, all in one strategy. So we know what's so much powerful, but there's also one thing I wanna warn you about because I see this all the time in my Facebook group, and the biggest mistake I see is people that, well, let's just go to the slide. The big mistake I see is trying to reverse engineer someone else's summit and see the results you want. So you might be here at this summit being like, how are they doing this? But people I see will say things like, I'm so inspired by everyone in this group. You know, maybe they take part in a couple summits, maybe even, some of our client summits, but number 1, there's so much you don't see from the outside looking in that goes into a summit. So many pieces, so many emails, so much strategy, so many decisions, so many little tasks that you never think about, but more importantly, I want you to keep in mind that not all summits are set up to be profitable or lead into a successful course launch. In fact, most of them aren't.\
\
Krista Miller [00:08:05]:\
Okay? And I'm gonna take you through an example here. So this is what industry standard summit conversion rates look like typically some of our registration pages convert around 20 to 30%, so maybe 30% of people who see your summit registration page might sign up from there this is actually kind of an old stat I would say right now industry standard is, like, 2 to 3%. All access pass conversion rates because things have gone down a little bit recently. I think just because of of the rise in summits. So that means, like, 2 to 3% of people who sign up for your summit that's run the typical way, 2 to 3 percent of those people might choose to upgrade to your all access pass, and then most, hosts miss the opportunity to launch on the back end of the event, or they don't do it well because no one else is teaching it like we do here at Summit In A Box and in our launch with the summit Accelerator Programme, but let's just do an example here to kinda give you some numbers and some context with that. So assuming that 4,000 people see your summit's registration page between you, your speakers, maybe you run some ads if you want to, you get 4,000 people to that page. These are the results you'd see based on that taking percentages kind of in the middle of their example ranges I gave, so, and we're also gonna figure in a $100 average all access pass sale price for easy math that might be a little bit higher than what some people, and up with with the average price, but I just wanna give you something really easy to visualize here. The numbers are not the point.\
\
Krista Miller [00:09:26]:\
The comparison I'm gonna show you in a minute is the point. Okay. So just give me a second for that. So with those 4,000 people seeing the summit registration page, we'd expect about 1,000 of those people to register for the Summit, which would lead to about $3,000 in all access pass sales. You're not gonna hear me complain about a 1,000 leads, I'll take that, but I am not willing to put in months of work for $3,000 in sales. So I will be the 1st to tell you that summits are just straight up not worth it to run with the way they're typically done. With with the way people look at other people's events, maybe follow other strategies out there. I don't know how they're doing it.\
\
Krista Miller [00:10:03]:\
With these standard conversion rates, it's just not worth it. But let's compare it to what this standard conversion rate looks like using our framework. So this is what our client conversion rates typically look like. So summit conversion rates across across the board have gone down a little bit lately, and I've could adjust the conversion rates, we expect here to fit that. So if you were to go watch another one of my pre recorded trainings that haven't been updated yet, you might see that all access pass conversion rates and those examples are a little higher, but just know, that lately, I would say as of, like, q4 2022, things have gone down a little bit, so I am factoring that in here, I'm not inflating things. Anyways, we tend to see between 50 to 65% of people who view the summit registration page sign up. We've had clients get higher than that, but I always try to show reasonable numbers, and from there, we've been seeing an average of about 8 to 12% of attendees upgrade to the all access pass, just depending on the niche, the messaging, the time of year, sometimes the the website design. We'll see as low as 6% with our clients as high as 25%, but I would say 8 to 12% is the most common right now, and then from there, the conversion rate for the launch of your course will generally stay in line with past conversion rates you've seen.\
\
Krista Miller [00:11:12]:\
So a summit isn't magically gonna make a sales page or a webinar or an offer that doesn't convert work well, right? But it will warm up thousands of leads really quickly and get them excited to jump in, which is why we, I I specifically tend to talk to people who already have those proven offers and you have those stats stats and you know how things are gonna go. So the safest bet for your launch conversion rate for a summit is to compare it to your past launch results and your past conversion rate. So just like we did with the industry standard conversion rates, let's assume we got 4,000 people to your registration page, Again, going with conversion rates in the middle or lower end of these ranges, that would bring us to about 24 100 people registered for your summit. From there, you'd end up with about $24,000 in all access pass sales. And assuming a lower price course of about $200 with a 2% conversion rate, you'd add almost an additional $10k through a launch. And I know some of you are selling, like, I don't know, $50 a month membership, some of you are selling $2,000 premium courses, some are selling $10k group programs, so that last line can look way different, just based on what you're offering, but my point here is this comparison. Seeing these numbers side by side is so eye opening to me every single time, the way summits are typically done are not worth it to do. It's so important to host a high converting summit the right way, so you could actually see a payoff from the work you put in.\
\
Krista Miller [00:12:33]:\
So if you were to host someone that drives 4,000 page views, by the way, if you have, like 20 speakers that comes down to about 200 visitors per speaker, so it's doable, you can add a 1,000 leads to your list with the way summits are typically done or over 2 times that with our framework. You could, you could add $3,000 in revenue with the typical summit model or over 24,000 with our framework, and it's really so powerful. I've broken down examples in other trainings for everything from, premium courses, high ticket programs, low price memberships, but I hope these numbers are helping you see a little bit about why the high converting summit is our first key here and why I am so passionate about that part of it. So we're comparing what not so good conversion rates can do to your overall results compared to good ones, but what makes a summit have those high conversion rates? Right? Like, how how do we make sure we're on the the right side of that comparison? There are a lot of pieces at play, of course, but the biggest part is the way you position your event. So this includes positioning that both attracts the right audience to your summit and aligns really well with the course you want to launch afterwards. And this will make sure that we're not only filling your funnel with leads, but filling your funnel with the right leads, which is important. Right? So what goes into this positioning? First, you have the specific group of people your summit is for, this is, of course, quite important. I'll walk through the big mistake we we see with that here in a second.\
\
Krista Miller [00:13:56]:\
Then you have the tangible outcome your summit will create for those people, and third, it includes the messaging you use to communicate both of those first two pieces. So when you're positioning a spot on, you're someone that attracts the right people and makes them actually wanna sign up, which is a good start, so your number of registrations just skyrockets there. It leads speakers to actually be excited to participate in your event, so if you think about the past few pitches you might have received, so many, so much of our decision goes into how what we're being pitched is positioned. If we understand it, if we care about it, if we like the person, if it's for an audience we wanna be in front of, the right positioning makes writing copy so much easier and more effective and with the amount of copy that goes into a summit, this this is just a must. And it also builds desire for your course while helping attendees make progress through your summit, so they're primed and ready for that next step with you. The big mistake we see all the time here is just bad or kind of meaningless summit positioning, and you might think, no, I wouldn't do that, but almost every summit host we've ever worked with has needed help on this piece. I've seen some of the biggest business owners out there, people you would a 100% know the name of, get this wrong and then go on to say that some of us don't work because of it, when really it's because they missed one of the key pieces. So what does bad positioning look like? And, you know, I always feel a little weird here because I don't wanna, like, call out anyone who has used these things before, but here are a few examples that came to mind.\
\
Krista Miller [00:15:19]:\
Vague positioning looks like a summit to help online business owners grow their business, a summit to help entrepreneurs make more money, a summit to help burnt out moms be happier, a summit to help intuitive women find inner peace. Positioning like this is what will lead you to see those industry standard 20 to 30% conversion rates we were talking about earlier. But on the flip side, what are some examples of position that works well? So these are all client examples that really nailed this, so I submit to help crochet business owners increase profit while nurturing their love for crochet, I submit to help small churches reignite their children's ministry, I submit to help moms of toddlers learn techniques to regain control without yelling, a summit to help card makers find inspiration for and make their holiday cards. So do you see the difference? Like, how much more powerful and exciting are these examples on the right side? This, like, these are examples of things that are gonna catch people's attention. Someone will identify with all of those options on the right side, but not necessarily the options on the left. And here's a similar comparison for the topics. A summit to make more money versus reigniting a children's ministry. So like all of the options, on the right side are just so much more attention grabbing, and the results really spoke for themselves there.\
\
Krista Miller [00:16:28]:\
So I want you to start brainstorming your son positioning today. So first, consider who is the audience for your business as a whole, who are you targeting, or if you're gonna launch your course after the summit, who is that course for, who's the audience for that course? Next, this is a step almost everyone needs to take, okay, what subsets or smaller groups can you break that audience down into? So, for example, if my larger audience is someone with some kind of signature offer, I could break that down into course creators, membership site owners, people running high ticket programs, honestly, even those are very broad and somewhat unclear, but that gives you an example of how you can look at breaking down your audience into subsets. From there, look at which of those you're most drawn to, or which group have you gotten the best results with, or which one sounds the most fun to you. That group is your summit audience. Okay? And that doesn't mean, like, you're leaving everyone else out. It might means you do different editions of your summit so that they actually convert well instead of, you know, you turning into one of the people that says some of us don't work. So next, from there, consider what that specific targeted audience that you landed on, what that group of people needs help with that doesn't, like, apply to everyone on the Internet. Right? What's specific to them? So going back to my personal example, I run a summit called sell with the summit.\
\
Krista Miller [00:17:47]:\
The first version of that was, one for course creators. So it was course creator edition, and our mission was to teach people to combine the power of their course with the high converting summit to hit their launch goals, scale their course sales, all of that stuff. And then the person I originally created that summit with went on to host versions, for membership site owners, speakers, podcasters, and then I took it back over into course creator edition again. But like for example for the membership site edition her promise was to help membership site owners add their next 50 to 100 members with the summit. We were able to get so much more specific because we went and niched down the specific audiences and did different versions of the event. So, hopefully, you see here how, overall, like, even with our example, the thing we were helping with was increase sales. Right? But because we niched down, we were able to speak way more specifically, and I want you be able to do that too. So based on what those people need help with how can you make that more specific more actionable more positioned to like how you can help rather than necessarily focusing on like pain points And then how can you position it to build desire for your offer without replacing that offer? And when you put all those pieces together that is your summit topic.\
\
Krista Miller [00:19:02]:\
In this piece, I would say is both the most important and the hardest to get right. Okay? But it's so worth the effort and thought and time you put into it because even if absolutely everything else for the summit is done right, the positioning can be what causes this difference. You seeing conversion rates here on this slide, and if you're like, oh, I'm gonna need to walk through that again, I'm gonna talk about a free resource at the end where we have specific trainings on both the audience and the topic, and also talk talk more about tying it in to be positioned well for your course. So, I'll talk about that at the end. The 3rd key is your summit speakers, and these are speakers who will both bring an audience to your event and build an audience from participating. So everyone always wants to know how many speakers am I supposed to have. There's no set rule. Okay.\
\
Krista Miller [00:19:44]:\
A summit using our strategies can really have anywhere from 10 to 30 speakers. I would say the most common range is from 15 to 25 ish. The key here is that they need to be really strategically selected to bring and build that audience. They'll come into your event, deliver a value pack presentation, and good to go. Right? The presentation they can do can be live or prerecorded. I suggest prerecorded for a first time event. They can be, slide presentations or interviews. I tend to lean towards slides, and then, about 20 minutes long is typically the sweet spot to keep your attendees from getting bored and checking out, but don't stress over that piece too much, as, you know, you'll be able to see from the fact that my presentation is probably gonna end up longer than that.\
\
Krista Miller [00:20:24]:\
So the biggest mistake here I would say is inviting the wrong people\
\
Krista Miller [00:20:31]:\
to speak, and this tends to show up in the form of inviting the first people that come to mind and just\
\
Krista Miller [00:20:31]:\
kind of generally prioritizing the wrong wrong things in your speaker search, which leads to speakers who don't promote or promote without much success. So for example, pitching the big name influencer you have in mind, like that's cool, but are they gonna promote? Probably not. Pitching your business besties or the person you see speaking at every single summit. Those things really won't do a darn thing for, actually creating a successful event. So we have 8 steps to take, to brainstorm speakers and 7 pieces of criteria. We walk our clients through to decide if they're a good fit, but the first thing to look for is the audience match. So you want the speakers you pitch to have the same audience as you're targeting for your summit. Otherwise, they're not gonna be excited to promote something to something that doesn't make sense for their audience, or if they do promote, they're not gonna see results because they're promoting to the wrong people.\
\
Krista Miller [00:21:19]:\
So when I hosted my summit for brand and web designers, I was looking for speakers who marketed themselves to brand and web designers specifically and had proven offers for those people because I know if they can sell that offer to those people, like, they understand how to market to this audience and that's what I'm looking for. Both as far as promoting my summit goes and as far as speaking on my summit goes. So why does this matter so much? Without an audience match, your speakers aren't gonna be, as excited to be a part of your event. If they do agree, they'll do the bare minimum in order to get a little visibility, but they're just not gonna be in it. And the people you pitch are more likely to say no as well. It doesn't make sense for them to spend time on something that's not gonna bring the right audience in. Right? If they agree to speak, they're, like I said, less likely to promote, meaning those 4,000 page reviews from our example are way harder to get. And if they if they do promote, you're just not gonna see the results you're looking for.\
\
Krista Miller [00:22:07]:\
And when I figured this out, this was the difference you see there in the $22k summit and the $60k summit. The only change I made was figuring out, like, oh, the speakers who got the good results here all all targeted the same audience as my summit. Imagine that, let's try, you know, doubling down on that next time. Okay. That worked. Then I did it again the next time. Okay. That worked.\
\
Krista Miller [00:22:27]:\
So I learned this through trial and error, but luckily, you don't have to. And finally, key number 4 to filling your funnel with leads and launching with the summit is awareness, and that's awareness for your course that you're building in throughout your summit without being pitchy and gross, so give you a little quiz here, which launch is gonna have better results? Summit A, that's total pitch fest, summit B, where there's no mention of the course and it's just like sprung on them, or summit C, where attendees have slowly become aware of the course and the fact that it will be available as a summit has gone on, but they're not being pitched until they're ready for it, like, obviously, I'm setting you up there, the answer is c, but the big mistakes you wanna avoid here are either turning your summit into a pitch fest or blindsiding attendees and speakers with a pitch they weren't expecting. Neither one goes over well, and there's definitely a fine line to keep in mind, but awareness of it is is the first step, but, like, that's why strategically building that awareness in in a way that feels good to you, your attendees, and your speakers is so important. We want your attendees, like, begging you to open the cart by the time that you do, and we want your speakers, understanding and knowing that your cart is gonna open as well. We have an entire module going over all of this in our accelerator program, but to give you an example, like, one way you can build awareness really simply is to just include the name of your course whenever you introduce yourself in a video. Like, hey I'm Krista founder of summit in a box and creator of the launch with the summit accelerator program that helps you hit your next level launch goals with virtual summit like it's a you know it's a little bit wordier than if I just said hey I'm Krista but it gives them so much more understanding of who I am and I get to talk about my program every single time I'm in front of them without pitching them. Right? They're just, like, gently having the awareness built of it. It's so powerful.\
\
Krista Miller [00:24:05]:\
You know, there are more obvious things you actually wanna do with within your summit, but I just wanna give you an idea of different, like, low key ways you can build awareness. So I know this was both a lot and not a lot at the same time. Like, these will get you started. These are the things I want you to consider when you go into start brainstorming, what it's gonna look like to launch your course through a summit. So we talked about how to position your summit to attract attendees, speakers, and set you up for successful launch. You learned why not just any speaker should be a part of your lineup both for your sake and theirs, and you saw the importance of strategically building awareness for your offer through your summit. So I hope this has your wheels turning and that you see the power in the strategy.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.490] - Marvin\
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. I am Marvin Flavien and this is how to navigate the world of video in the visual era. I'm so happy you decided to spend your time with me today, so let's get into it. It's a little bit about me. I'm a video marketing strategist. I'm the owner of N K Flay Video.\
\
[00:00:30.120] - Marvin\
I help service based entrepreneurs and coaches connect with the audience online and scale it using video online. And I actively create content for my brand. Everything I'm going to share with you today is something that we do and what we do for our clients. So, we are going to impact in this presentation a very simple yet effective way to leverage video for your business to reach an audience. So, let's get into it.\
\
[00:00:52.540] - Marvin\
This is for you if you don't know how to get started brand new with video, or maybe you've done some stuff didn't really work out the way you wanted to, but at least you tried. This is for you too. Or if you're actively creating videos, you're probably crushing right now. At least looking for a better system or better hacks.\
\
[00:01:11.500] - Marvin\
Let me know in the comments. Are you A, you don't know how to get started? B you tried it, maybe worked with someone before or C, you actively creating videos and you just looking for a better system for some better hacks. So, let me know which one are you in the comments?\
\
[00:01:30.450] - Marvin\
Alright, cool. So, today we're going to talk about how to navigate the world of video in a visual era, but before we jump into it, I just want to let you know. Look, if you haven't had success yet, it's not your fault. Maybe no one ever showed you the right way to do it, or no one's really teaching or showing you the right way to do it. People are probably just copying other people and doing whatever they think is trendy at the time and you know.\
\
[00:01:57.390] - Marvin\
Or you're probably missing a piece. And you don't really have a real strategy that you can go to. But I'm here to tell you that all ends today. So, I want to ask you a question. When you hear the word video, what do you think about?\
\
[00:02:12.890] - Marvin\
How does that make you feel? What's the first thing that comes to mind? Give you some time, right? Does it frustrating? Is it the platform? Is it the gear, the tech?\
\
[00:02:24.670] - Marvin\
Like, what is it that I want to know where you are when you hit that word video, you can comment. I'll be reading some of them off. You can comment. But let's take a step back, step back and examine what video really is. What is video? For starters, it's a tool.\
\
[00:02:42.600] - Marvin\
It's a powerful tool that exists outside of time and space. It's not bound by our laws. What does that mean? Well, listen, you're here. You're listening to me.\
\
[00:02:52.540] - Marvin\
You're watching me. You're bound by this task. We're here right now, right? You're not here. You're not there.\
\
[00:02:59.150] - Marvin\
You're not anywhere else but here. So, video doesn't play by these rules. Video can be here. Video can be there. Video can be over there all day, every day, twice on Sundays.\
\
[00:03:10.150] - Marvin\
So, think about that. Think about that. Think about that kind of power and what it could do for your business. And notice how I didn't classify as video as a real or going live or a piece of content. Why?\
\
[00:03:22.790] - Marvin\
Because it's so much more than that. And when we start looking at video for what it truly is. We can start looking at how we can actually use it. So, what is video? I think it's the most powerful business tool in the world. It hits at the core of every business pillar.\
\
[00:03:39.690] - Marvin\
Business revolve around time, money and relationships, right? Businesses need time. They have time, they can solve any problem. Businesses need money, they need money, they have it.\
\
[00:03:51.670] - Marvin\
They can solve any problem if they need. Businesses need relationships, they need connections. Right. If they have it, they can solve any problem. And video hits at those three cores of the business. Video can automate time.\
\
[00:04:04.390] - Marvin\
A lot of things companies are doing. They're repeating over and over again. You can make a video and implement it, so you can get your time back. You don't have to do that thing over and over. We all know video increases conversion anywhere you put.\
\
[00:04:18.570] - Marvin\
Anywhere you put. Video builds relationships. It builds trust. Think about when you've seen the video of a business or company of a person. Think about how more friendly you felt or like you felt like you knew them because of that video.\
\
[00:04:34.050] - Marvin\
You know video itself can even be the product. Video can be the product that you sell, right? And I want to break it down like video into two different strategies for you to make it simple and sum it up. Offense and defense strategy.\
\
[00:04:51.150] - Marvin\
I don't even watch those, but this is your video strategy. Think of football, right? You got offense line. You got a defense line like they play a specific role. They have a job to do.\
\
[00:05:03.270] - Marvin\
Think about that same thing with video. Offensive video is where you put things out into the world, to bring people into ours, into yours or ours. This is where we see most of our content, like on social. It's real tiktoks going viral. That's where all this comes to play, you know putting things out into the world to bring people into ours.\
\
[00:05:23.980] - Marvin\
Scrolling your feed might have never been connected with them, but they see it. That's offensive video, right? That's the offensive. Defense is when people go looking for you, you know they're looking for more information about you. And most of the time, people are driving traffic to either their website or funnel. But these videos will live there to give them the information that they need.\
\
[00:05:45.410] - Marvin\
You know a term we like to use is securing your defense, where videos are placed, where decisions need to be made.\
\
[00:05:53.470] - Marvin\
I want you to look at it and think of it. So, as for your defense, this is an area where you can save so much time in your business, like you never have to explain what you do over and over again. Right? Video does that for you when they get on that video. This is what they do.\
\
[00:06:08.760] - Marvin\
Alright, cool. Cool. Cool. I want to work with this person. Video can do that. And it can be working for you at all times. Someone can be on your website right now.\
\
[00:06:18.130] - Marvin\
Someone could be on my website right now learning about me, my company, who I am, and if they want to work with me or not. That's all happening while we're here. Defense, that's the power of that. We can qualify. Prospects can save time, especially if you're in a service base business. Providing service can qualify prospects.\
\
[00:06:37.070] - Marvin\
They can see they like you. They get to see a process and things like that. So, you don't have to do that outside of that. That's what defensive video strategy can do. So, people are looking for you, and if it's done right, they get to experience to you, you know.\
\
[00:06:51.340] - Marvin\
And this can play a huge role in your sales process, too. Hey, watch this video, book a call or call before you know. One of our clients is a coach, and when they help on sales calls, they're ready to go because the video that they seen gives them all the stuff that they need. They're excited to work with them. They're ready to go.\
\
[00:07:11.540] - Marvin\
And you can have that, too. Alright. Now, offense. Now, this is the sales, the money, the building connection, the relationship. This is where your offensive video strategy comes into play.\
\
[00:07:20.870] - Marvin\
There's many ways to go about this, are you? I'm not going to tell you what's going to be right for you, because I need to know more about you with your goals and what you're doing. But the two things I can give you and we're going to talk about this more later in a bit in a second. But understand where your audience is and who your audience is and what your goals are. So, you have to know going into it.\
\
[00:07:41.440] - Marvin\
What is it? I want to get out of it. What is it I want these videos to do? And then where is my audience and who's my audience? Alright.\
\
[00:07:50.750] - Marvin\
So, how do we navigate the world of video in a visual era? Well, the first thing you can do is secure your defense. You know implement video to your sales practices like we talked about before, like my coach client. Right. The point of this is to not build any new strategies but like focus on accelerating the current things that you're already doing, the stuff that you're already good at.\
\
[00:08:11.860] - Marvin\
If you're great, your product and service is great, why not implement a video that can help you save time on consultations or maybe skip them all completely. Some people can do that. We have some clients who do that. And that's the thing. You don't have to really you know add anything new, but it changes with the stuff that's already there and that's good and working.\
\
[00:08:34.950] - Marvin\
That's a perfect opportunity to implement a video, right.\
\
[00:08:41.430] - Marvin\
If you're doing it, and if it's working, you can unbound yourself from that time. So, when people go looking for you, they have a video that gives them all the stuff that they need to know to make a decision if they want to work with you or not. And we kind of have a way of doing this. We call it a video business card.\
\
[00:08:55.900] - Marvin\
It's a two minute video answer where people are excited about the company. They want to learn more about the company. This video indoctrinates them on what this company is about you know. But listen, yours doesn't need to be like that. All you really need to do is welcome your visitors.\
\
[00:09:09.550] - Marvin\
You can record a video, explain who you are and welcome them to your site. Give her a face to her name, right. Now if you want to step into the realm of offensive video, here's something that can help you. And I'm proud to introduce to you my COOL method. Alright.\
\
[00:09:24.340] - Marvin\
Very cool. Very cool. So the COOL method offensive strategy basically put it. Define your call to action. Right? Focus on that one person.\
\
[00:09:36.390] - Marvin\
Get over the gear and leverage the platform. Define the call to action so that your viewers can take action. Focus on that one person, so you can help the person and get your message out clear and it's clear and it's engaged and get over the gear so you can just do it. You can get into it and do it and leverage the platform, so your videos can work for you. Now we're going to go dive into it.\
\
[00:09:59.570] - Marvin\
Alright. Now call to Action unless you're a YouTuber likes and comments are not call to action, again unless you are a YouTuber, that's your main thing. Likes and comments are not a call to action. Your video needs to have what's next? What is the next step that you take?\
\
[00:10:16.380] - Marvin\
What do you want your viewers to do? You did all that work. They got them to watch your video and they loved it. They probably enjoyed it. They got to it and you're not going to offer them something.\
\
[00:10:26.150] - Marvin\
You're not going to invite them to join you at the end. Like you really don't need to have a call to action. So, what are your goals? What do you want the outcome to be? This is what you need for your video, especially if you don't offer the video.\
\
[00:10:41.610] - Marvin\
It needs to have a call to action. And one thing just to point out if you're reaching cold audience and they're landing on your video, you got to give them what the video is about right away. Get to the point, provide the value and then get them to commit or like, you know how YouTubers, when they say, like this video. You don't want to do that, especially if it's for a cold audience. You want to tell them what the video is about.\
\
[00:11:05.360] - Marvin\
Get to the point. So you can, like, make a decision, like, I want to stay here and watch this and then you give them that call to action. Maybe in the beginning, maybe in the end, depends. But you get to the point. Focus on that one person.\
\
[00:11:17.400] - Marvin\
This is super super super important. Super important. Focus on your ideal person. Give them a name, you know talk to them. What do they need?\
\
[00:11:26.450] - Marvin\
What is it that they want? How do you want them to feel watching this? You know I'm going to say this. Stop trying to go viral. Stop trying to talk to everybody.\
\
[00:11:37.210] - Marvin\
If you're talking to everybody, you're talking to no one. You need to be focused on that one person and talk to them directly. And that one person can be multiple people. But you're talking to that specific need and the thing that they want. And you know that's how you can make, especially your video creation or so much easier, because your focus, you're honed in to that one person.\
\
[00:12:01.020] - Marvin\
Everyone is trying to go viral and try to get as many views as possible, which is a horrible strategy, because if it doesn't work out, you're going, you're to be upset about it. But anyway, focus on that one person. And if you want to get comfortable on camera, this is going to help you tremendously, because you are literally talking to that person that needs your help and you're talking to them. You know you get more practice and talking to them directly. You're not talking to everyone, talking to those right people.\
\
[00:12:27.770] - Marvin\
Other people can watch your video, of course, but they're the people that's going to be super engaged with it because you're talking directly to what they need and what they want. And I just got to say this, like, video isn't just about entertainment. Focus on the value that it brings. You can be the voice with message that the person needs to hear, to invite them to join you, to join you on your mission or get the help that they need. It's not about all about entertainment.\
\
[00:12:54.490] - Marvin\
Yes, some people are just naturally entertaining and funny, but that's not all what video is about. And as far as getting over the gear, quality is subjective. But your impact is not. Say that again, quality is subjective, but your impact is not. Your camera doesn't matter.\
\
[00:13:16.340] - Marvin\
Maybe your surroundings, your background, your lighting, audio is really more important anyway. But if you only got a phone, use your phone. If you only got a webcam, use your webcam like someone could be out there right now and you can help them. But we're not going to show up because we don't have a fancy camera. We don't got the latest Iphone, we don't got the latest 4K thing.\
\
[00:13:38.870] - Marvin\
We don't have a great camera, and we're not going to show up because of that.\
\
[00:13:45.030] - Marvin\
That doesn't sound right, and you shouldn't operate like that one. So, get over the gear. And like I said before, audio is probably more important anyway over the video quality anyway, because if video can look great, but if it doesn't sound good, most people won't watch it. So, some quick tips is just keep the mic as close as possible. I like to use Lav mics if you do something that can plug directly into your phones and things like that, but keep your mic as close to you as possible.\
\
[00:14:12.840] - Marvin\
You don't want your camera and your mic here and you're shooting all the way back there. It's not what you want. Alright. Now optimize the video on each platform. So, leverage the platforms. Some of the mistakes I see people see, some of the mistakes I see people make.\
\
[00:14:30.830] - Marvin\
People are not pinning a video on top of their social. It's hard to one of the best tools. If someone new landing on your page, you can pin a video to the top and they can watch that. They don't have captions on platforms that partisan video Instagram. Most people sometimes are scrolling and they don't hear anything, but they can read or see captions.\
\
[00:14:53.330] - Marvin\
Another thing too, is please repurpose your content. Please do not post it one time and think it's going to do all things that needs to do, especially on social media, especially your website. Like I said, defense, that's totally different. This is all offense we're talking about right now. Repurpose the content.\
\
[00:15:10.830] - Marvin\
The video that you create could be turned into multiple pieces of content you know. This is what we do for our brand. It's what we do for our clients. But just get it out of your thought process that I posted already. No one knows going to watch it like, no, keep putting it out there.\
\
[00:15:26.940] - Marvin\
If you know how the algorithm works. People are not seeing everything the first time, and people are not seeing everything you post at all times. So, it's okay to put things out there into the world and putting it out in different ways and things like that. So that's what I want you to do. You want video to work for you?\
\
[00:15:43.920] - Marvin\
You need to leverage the platform that we have. I'm not even talking about ads. I'm really talking about organically leveraging the path of the tools that they have, the playing by their rules. This is what you can do. Alright, so let's recap. What we're going to do.\
\
[00:15:58.360] - Marvin\
Secure our defense, record a video, explain who we are and welcome our new visitors to our site. Give them a face go and they define our call to action, so we can get our viewers to take actions. Remember, like some comments on our call to action. Focus on that one person. How you can help them? So, your message is clear.\
\
[00:16:15.530] - Marvin\
It's engaging. Get over the gear so you can create freely and authentically leverage the platform so your videos can work for you.\
\
[00:16:25.290] - Marvin\
And look, I'm going to give you my permission that you need it to show up authentically as you are. I don't know where I would be if I never posted that video. This is like one of my earlier video content series. It was consistently, so it wasn't just like a postal one. It was a port piece in that series, but I don't know where I'll be.\
\
[00:16:47.420] - Marvin\
I know for a fact. I want to be here talking to you if I never posted that. Gave my audience so much value at that time and gave me a lot of confidence because getting to see like, oh, this is what people need help on you know. I got to learn so much about me, my audience and all different things. So, I don't know where I'll be if I never posted that video. So, here is my permission to you to just show up as you are.\
\
[00:17:12.870] - Marvin\
And remember, you're helping people. Don't let the fear of what other people may think hold you back from reaching the people, your people, those people. And I promise you it was the most rewarding and also feeling when someone reaches out, you get a client or someone says, like, this piece of content, video actually helps. No, it's the most awesome thing. Just remember that. And video is not about being flashy.\
\
[00:17:37.070] - Marvin\
I keep saying it's not about entertainment. It's not about being flashy. It's really about a tool that merges and bridges that get that reality and bring forth that experience. That's what video is. That's what video is about.\
\
[00:17:50.710] - Marvin\
So, focus on that one person. Don't try to go viral. Don't even worry about it. Your people will be attracted to how clear your message will be because it is for them. Even if it helped one person, it helped one person.\
\
[00:18:07.350] - Marvin\
That's all that matters. Right? So, if you're good at what you do, if you're helping people for changing lives, what you can do is allow more people to see it. You can bring more people into your world and share these stories. Something I like to say is show, don't tell. Show.\
\
[00:18:25.670] - Marvin\
Don't tell. So, if you have a great product, show it. If you provide a great service, show it. Did something awesome for a client, show us. Show us the story, tell us the story, but also show us. And that is how you navigate the world of video and a visual era.\
\
[00:18:44.050] - Marvin\
So if you made it this far, I appreciate it. Thanks for hanging with me. I really hope this helps. And honestly, I really can't wait to see what you all come up with and deal with this. And if you're looking for some more hands on support, I have a free training ten videos to help you get comfortable on camera.\
\
[00:19:02.630] - Marvin\
Tell you exactly what the topic should be about and how you should kind of go about it. I'm just head to that link, and it should be there. I'm pretty sure there's a button down somewhere where you can click it and kind of get into it. But that's that. And honestly, too, if you're ready to work with someone, if you think that okay, I might be ready to step into this.\
\
[00:19:21.040] - Marvin\
You can definitely reach out to us. Just head to our website and you know schedule a call. We do have different ways of working with people, whether you're locally or not. We have a lot of different ways. And like I was talking about as far as, like, there's many ways to go about as far as like your offensive video, we pretty much have our own system, our own formula, how we go about creating content. That's one manageable.\
\
[00:19:42.190] - Marvin\
You get the most out of it as far as time, and we get a lot done. And pretty much, we basically do it for you, or we show you how to do it and we manage it for you. So, there's a lot of different ways that we can do it. All you have to do is reach out and have a chat with us. But like I said, thank you so much for spending this time with me.\
\
[00:19:57.680] - Marvin\
I can't wait to hear all the other speakers. It's about to be a super, super awesome summit and can't wait to see more. And I appreciate you being here. So this is my free gift to you. And until we see each other again, hopefully, I'll see you one of your videos.\
\
[00:20:08.790] - Marvin\
Hopefully, I'll see you on the Facebook group, but, yeah, that's it.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:10.160] - Meredith Marsh, meredithmarsh.co\
Hey there, it's a Meredith Marsh here, and welcome to the presentation for how to build your profitable YouTube channel in one hour a day. I'm going to officially introduce myself in just a moment, but I want to quickly thank Liz for having me here this year for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am so excited about 2021. And we're going to dive into one of my favorite topics, YouTube. I've got some slides for you so you don't have to watch me talk with my hands this whole time.\
\
[00:00:39.740] - Meredith\
All right. So let's dive into this now. I'm going to make a big giant assumption and assume that you're here because you would like to increase your audience and come online using YouTube. That's what we're all here for, right? Well, in this session, I'm going to teach you a simple way to incorporate YouTube into your existing strategy in one hour a day so that you can impact more people while making more money online, even if you're, \'93just anything\'94.\
\
[00:01:14.630] - Meredith\
You're just a mom. You're just a blogger, just a coach, just an attorney, just a shy introvert who prefers to be behind the camera. Or if you're a side hustler, a full time online entrepreneur or full time blogger, or if you manage your household full time or even if you have a full time job and you just can't walk away from your day to day life to start a YouTube channel, this is your chance to take those first steps towards starting and growing a YouTube channel that can lead to long term profit without it taking over your life completely.\
\
[00:01:48.590] - Meredith\
Like I already mentioned, my name is Meredith Marsh. I am the creator of the Meredith Marsh YouTube channel. It used to be called the vidpromom uYouTube channel.\
\
[00:01:58.610] - Meredith\
I'm also the founder of the Video Pursuit Society and I blog over at Vidpro Mom.Com. And my passion is helping side hustler's thrive as video content creators. I love giving the what I call the beyond the job training that you need to grow your audience and then come online using YouTube so that you can create more options and opportunities for yourself outside of a traditional job. And I'm sure it's no surprise to you that time is the biggest struggle that my clients and students have when it comes to getting their YouTube channel off the ground.\
\
[00:02:38.720] - Meredith\
But there's two things that I teach them right away about time.\
\
[00:02:43.710] - Meredith\
The first is that time is actually the number one reason why YouTube is the perfect side hustle or addition to an existing blog or online business. The content you create on YouTube has longevity, thanks to the fact that it\'92s search engine and when your videos are getting views for months and even years down the road, you also earn passive income and you probably already know what passive income is.\
\
[00:03:11.540] - Meredith\
But in a really quick nutshell, when it comes to online business and content creation, passive income could be something where you're earning revenue in the form of something like ad revenue through YouTube or through your blog ad network or you're making affiliate sales. These are things where you don't need to be present to get paid. Now, as you can imagine, there's more to it than simply just publishing videos that you're interested in creating or videos that you think will do well on YouTube.\
\
[00:03:42.140] - Meredith\
In fact, if time is your biggest YouTube struggle right now, then this is more important than ever.\
\
[00:03:49.700] - Meredith\
If you have a YouTube channel already, right, and you've been publishing videos and not seeing much growth, like you're not getting views or subscribers or, you know, maybe you're getting some, but it's just not as much as what you were hoping for. It's not your fault.\
\
[00:04:05.570] - Meredith\
You probably haven't been applying a strategy and knowing the exact right steps to take in the right direction. So the second thing that I teach my new clients and students is the search and rescue method, which is the fastest way to grow your YouTube channel. There's a ton of conflicting information out there. I recently had someone reach out to me and say that YouTube is like a a swamp of information. There's so much of it.\
\
[00:04:36.320] - Meredith\
And you never know really what you're getting into. And it's hard to know what the right steps are.\
\
[00:04:43.640] - Meredith\
So during the session, we're going to dip our toes into the search and rescue method. And together we'll create the foundation for building your profitable YouTube channel. Plus, you'll also have a plan for how to pull it all together by spending just an hour a day on it, because who has time to let you, to take over your life right now? Right.\
\
[00:05:02.120] - Meredith\
So in this session, we're going to follow along with this workbook. You might have access to this already, if not, you can download it at Vidpromom.com/YouTubeworkbook, you don't have to give me your email address or anything. It's just a direct download of the PDF.\
\
[00:05:20.610] - Meredith\
Now, most people are hesitant to start a YouTube channel or they're confused about how to get their channel off the ground because there's so much information out there, a lot of it contradicts each other. It almost kind of feels like if you follow the advice of one guru, then you're going against the advice of another. Right. It's like totally confusing.\
\
[00:05:41.490] - Meredith\
And combine the confusion with finding time to sit down and figure out what videos to create, how to do the Keyword research for YouTube and is it different than blogging and then fiddle with the camera and the lights and the microphone to shoot something and then finally actually be able to edit your videos. I want you to know that I hear you. It is a lot and I am you. I am a full time content creator myself. I'm a mom. I have all the same household management life stuff that most of us have.\
\
[00:06:20.520] - Meredith\
The only difference between those of us who gain momentum on YouTube and those of us who stay stuck is that momentum requires us to take action no matter how small that action is. So I don't want to take up too much time here.\
\
[00:06:37.620] - Meredith\
I want to dive into the actual strategy stuff. But I love to tell the story about how I joined the track team when I was in eighth grade because my boyfriend at the time was on the track team. I didn't know how to run. I did not enjoy running at all. I certainly could not jump over a hurdle. I didn't know what a relay was, but I joined the track team and when the coach asked for a female to volunteer to be the triple jumper on the track team, nobody raised their hand.\
\
[00:07:11.460] - Meredith\
Which if you have ever seen someone do a triple jump or if you've done it yourself, you'll know why it's weird, it's awkward.\
\
[00:07:20.520] - Meredith\
You look really silly while you're doing it, because it's basically a combination of tripping over your own feet and then landing in a sand pit. Of course, I didn't know any of that. So for some reason I can't explain. I raised my hand to volunteer and as the lone female triple jumper on the team for that season, I only had to compete one time. In that event, none of the teams that we competed against had a female triple jumper to compete except for one.\
\
[00:07:52.380] - Meredith\
I had essentially chosen a sport that no one else dared to do because it was awkward. So what does it have to do with YouTube? I promise it does. According to a Pew Research study, the fact is 73 percent of adults in the United States use YouTube. That's more than Facebook. It's almost twice as much as Instagram. And according to YouTube, 70 percent of what people watch is determined by the recommendation algorithm, which is why the search and rescue method is the fastest way to grow your YouTube channel, because when you show up as a search result or a recommended channel again and again for your ideal viewers, you become what I like to call is the hero in your niche.\
\
[00:08:39.840] - Meredith\
You become that go to person on the biggest social media platform on the planet.\
\
[00:08:46.050] - Meredith\
So in your workbook at the very top on page two, just quickly jot down what exactly is your niche? What type of content are you creating?\
\
[00:08:57.960] - Meredith\
What's your broad niche? Just write that down at the top. And I if we were in an in-person conference, I would say look around at the other bloggers and content creators that are in your exact niche.\
\
[00:09:08.280] - Meredith\
But in this case, I know you know who they are, right? You, you follow them on Instagram, you probably follow them on Facebook. You see them in all the Facebook groups that you're also in. So just think about some of your fellow bloggers and influencers that are also in your niche.\
\
[00:09:28.140] - Meredith\
You probably know who's fish taco recipe is outranking you on Google, right, or who beat you to the 10000 Instagram followers milestones and now they get the swiper feature.\
\
[00:09:38.910] - Meredith\
And if you're in a popular niche like food or travel or lifestyle or health and fitness, you probably know tens or even hundreds of other people who are content creators within the same niche.\
\
[00:09:51.600] - Meredith\
Right. But how many of them are all in, on YouTube?\
\
[00:09:57.930] - Meredith\
So through my short career as a triple jumper, I learned that there are two ways to win in this world. The first way is to do the easy thing, the thing that everyone wants to do, the thing that anyone can do easily. And when it comes to online business, blogging, content creation, this means posting on Instagram, scheduling pins on Pinterest and just creating more and more of the same types of content. This stuff is relatively easy.\
\
[00:10:27.390] - Meredith\
As a content creator, you can do it and so can everyone else.\
\
[00:10:33.390] - Meredith\
The barrier to entry is pretty low.\
\
[00:10:36.720] - Meredith\
The second way is to do the thing that other people are kind of afraid to do because they might fail or they might look silly, or it might seem awkward at first and for online business, for blogging, for site hustler's content creators when it comes to doing YouTube, that's usually the thing that people don't want to do, right?\
\
[00:10:57.810] - Meredith\
It usually translates to you, well, I can't do YouTube because I say too much or I don't look good on camera. I'm too old for YouTube. I'm too fat for YouTube.\
\
[00:11:07.320] - Meredith\
Oh, I can't do that because I'm an introvert or I need to get my blog set up. I need to get my Instagram set up. I need to get my Pinterest set up. I need my brand photos done. I need to get my business cards printed before I'll be ready for YouTube.\
\
[00:11:21.270] - Meredith\
It's the thing that most content creators put off and very few dare to do. So YouTube is for people who want to be the type of person who dares to show up, even if you're an introvert like me, even if you have lots of other things going on in your life, like a family, your own business, your blog, or even a full time job like I did.\
\
[00:11:48.450] - Meredith\
But you might be wondering, isn\'92t YouTube huge? Like isn't there a massive amount of competition there? Am I too late to the party? Isn't there too much noise? How do I even stand out at this point?\
\
[00:11:59.550] - Meredith\
And the answer is yes. There is a lot of people on YouTube. There are a lot of YouTube channels. There's 31 million YouTube channels out there.\
\
[00:12:09.120] - Meredith\
But of those, only six million have 1000 subscribers or more. So what does that mean?\
\
[00:12:17.290] - Meredith\
That means that over 80 percent of the channels on YouTube are stuck as very small or new channels.\
\
[00:12:23.760] - Meredith\
Maybe the creator just started a channel for fun and they threw a few videos up.\
\
[00:12:29.820] - Meredith\
Maybe they started a channel and they didn't see success right away, so they gave up. Either way, they're not implementing the search and rescue method. So to use that track meet analogy, 80 percent of the channels on YouTube are created by people who dare to show up once or twice, but they're not prepared to compete. So let's dive back into the workbook here. What are your let's say like what are your top performing blog posts?\
\
[00:12:55.080] - Meredith\
What are your favorite topics that you like to talk about?\
\
[00:12:58.590] - Meredith\
What will you be covering on your YouTube channel? What is your audience asking you for? This can go in that second section under top topics on page two. This is essentially like the topics that you're going to build the foundation of your YouTube channel on. All you had to really do is jot down some ideas. So if you have a blog with content on it already, this would be a great place to write down some of your top topics. If you look into your analytics, if you don't have a blog or you're just getting started, then just think about what are your favorite topics to talk about or write about within your niche.\
\
[00:13:37.470] - Meredith\
What do you think would make a great foundation to build your channel on? And that's where you can jot down some ideas there.\
\
[00:13:46.290] - Meredith\
So for me, I started with GoPro tutorials back in 2015. I started a blog which turned into a YouTube channel all about teaching people how to use a GoPro camera, how to edit GoPro videos, how to create family videos with a GoPro camera, which accessories to buy that kind of thing. And I started my YouTube channel and my blog while I had a full time job. My kids were seven and three. I have two little girls. They're not as little anymore, I should say.\
\
[00:14:18.450] - Meredith\
One of them is taller than me. So I wish this was like the entrepreneurial love story that most people tell where they start a blog or a YouTube channel. They start to make money. They put in their two week notice and they quit their job. The truth is, I lost my job, but I had started with my Vidpromom as a side hustle, taking small but consistent baby steps. I started making a little bit of money. I launched a course.\
\
[00:14:44.640] - Meredith\
I was earning some passive income, and then my employer moved to another city and eliminated my position. It was really before I was ready to dive into full time online entrepreneurship, I, I kind of jumped. It was kind of like pushed a little bit, but I kind of jumped before I was ready. But I had the foundation of taking consistent action, the right steps in the right direction to build upon.\
\
[00:15:13.110] - Meredith\
And those are the exact steps that you're going to be able to take action on during this session. So let's dive in the next section here on page two is who are you? Who are you helping? What are you helping them do? Why do you need that? Why do they need that? Excuse me? And why are you the best person to help them? These may or may not be new questions for you, depending on where you're at in your blogging journey, but these are important steps to take and building your profitable YouTube channel.\
\
[00:15:48.720] - Meredith\
So then on page three, you're going to jot down some video topic ideas. So I like to have people start with ten ideas off the top of your head. I know you have a list of ideas in your head. I know you have been thinking like, oh, that might make a good YouTube video or could I make a YouTube video about that? How would that work? So ten ideas just off the top of your head. You probably have way more than that.\
\
[00:16:15.090] - Meredith\
Then you can write down, but just jot down ten to start with and then ten ideas that are super basic, like, you know, I don't know, sewing for beginners or something, you know, for beginners or how to get started with.\
\
[00:16:29.960] - Meredith\
X, Y and Z, what does your ideal viewer need in order to get started with the thing that you teach, with your topic, with your niche and then 10 topics around daily use products or software within your niche?\
\
[00:16:50.510] - Meredith\
I'm going to use an example, a couple of slides from now on, like crafting, sewing and things like that. So this is where you might write down, like the sewing machine that you use, the accessories, the brand of scissors that you use or where you shop for your fabric or what cutting machine you use, like that kind of thing.\
\
[00:17:14.240] - Meredith\
Like what are the actual products or software that you use within your niche that other people, that your audience would also be using or have questions about?\
\
[00:17:26.010] - Meredith\
So you've got a little brainstorm there of some some video topic ideas and what you've created so far with this workbook is not only the start of a great foundation for your YouTube channel, but also the makings of the perfect about page for your YouTube channel. And you might be thinking, oh, we have an about page on YouTube? A lot of people don't even know that it's there.\
\
[00:17:50.550] - Meredith\
If you set up a YouTube channel, like when you set up your blog and I know a lot of us do this where like we set up the blog, we get the domain name, we find the Instagram handle, the Twitter handle, the Pinterest account, the YouTube, the Facebook. So you may have a YouTube channel without any content on it, but you also have an about page.\
\
[00:18:11.490] - Meredith\
and if that is blank, you can use what you've created so far in this workbook to complete your about page really easily. And so here's why it's important to focus on this at this stage. So YouTube and humans, they need to know what your channel is about.\
\
[00:18:30.300] - Meredith\
Who are you? Where can I learn more about you? Are you like a real person or I mean, we\'92re all real people.\
\
[00:18:38.400] - Meredith\
But are you legit? Right. People want to know that. And perhaps most importantly, people want to know what is your channel about? The YouTube algorithm wants to know what your channel is about. Google wants to know what your channel is about.\
\
[00:18:52.320] - Meredith\
Why should people care?\
\
[00:18:54.180] - Meredith\
So the exercise is on pages two, three and four here are crucial for setting up your channel for success, not because you're about page per say, like your page is not going to make or break your YouTube channel, but because you've taken the time to figure these things out before you start creating content for YouTube. So page four is essentially a template that you can use to using what you have on pages two and three. You can kind of fill in the blanks here and create your YouTube about page.\
\
[00:19:31.110] - Meredith\
So with your rocking about page, you can create your channel art to visually represent your channel, what your channel is about, who it's for, why they should care. Page five of your workbook has a link to download my channel art template so that you can, can do your homework.\

After this session. You can finish setting up your channel, you can create your YouTube banner. It's a little bit tricky because of the sizing and that's why I created the template. So you can make sure that your channel Art doesn't get completely cut off, you know, in different devices. So you can grab that template there from the link in page five. But let's dive back into the strategy stuff.\
\
[00:20:13.710] - Meredith\
So YouTube desperately wants to match viewers with your video. So usually we kind of have this backwards in our minds. We usually think that YouTube is looking for viewers for our videos.\
\
[00:20:29.220] - Meredith\
Like if I publish a video, YouTube is going to go out and it's going to find my subscribers and it's going to find, I don't know, other random people. And it's going to put my video in front of those people. But it's actually the other way around. YouTube is actually looking for videos to match to its viewers.\
\
[00:20:49.080] - Meredith\
So when Sally logs into YouTube and she's on the YouTube homepage or she opens up the YouTube app, YouTube is going to gather up the videos that it thinks she's most likely to be interested in and show them to her at the top of the page, at the top of her homepage.\
\
[00:21:10.770] - Meredith\
So for every user on their platform, the algorithm is trying to predict exactly what that viewer is going to want to watch next. What are they actually going to hit play and watch next to to stay on the platform to watch more and more videos? Because the longer the viewers are on YouTube watching the content, the more money YouTube makes. And YouTube is obviously a business, a very big business. So YouTube wants people to watch your channel as much as you do.\
\
[00:21:42.660] - Meredith\
And using the search and rescue method, we can do some of the heavy lifting for YouTube and make it easier for YouTube to pair its viewers with videos, with your videos.\
\
[00:21:56.400] - Meredith\
So to help YouTube know who you are and what you're all about, we really need to fill out our niche on YouTube like a spider web. When you niche out your content, the spider web effect starts to take hold and the content you create begins to attract your ideal viewers. But the biggest benefit of the spider web effect is that you'll know which topics are worth your time to create. No more guessing. So remember these ideas from page three, right?\
\
[00:22:30.700] - Meredith\
Yeah, page three, we need to put these ideas into the spider web and this is where the examples come in here.\
\
[00:22:36.420] - Meredith\
So these are some example topics for someone who might be thinking about starting a channel about, let's say, like all things crafting. OK, so we have sewing, our cricket tutorials, buying guides. We have topics over there on the left hand side like how to sew scrunchies, how to sew curtains, watercolor for beginners, best cricket must have cricket accessories, things like that. So this is where the spider web effect comes into action. So let's pretend that this circle here on the right hand side is a spider web.\
\
[00:23:15.870] - Meredith\
So if you imagine that you took like three to four categories from your list of ideas, if we go back here, we have ,sewing our cricket tutorials, and buying guides. We kind of separated our ideas into some categories, into some like buckets, if you will.\
\
[00:23:32.610] - Meredith\
And this is where the spider web effect starts to work. So we took our categories. We have three or four. Three or four is usually a good place to start.\
\
[00:23:44.040] - Meredith\
You know, preferably three is is usually enough for your brain to handle.\
\
[00:23:49.410] - Meredith\
And we're going to say this niche is crafts or crafting. So we have crafts right there in the middle of our spider web.\
\
[00:23:58.450] - Meredith\
So crafting is at the spider of the web, the spider of the web, crafting is at the center of the web, and you want to cover all of these topics on your channel, right. So let's say this week you create a video about how to sew scrunchies.\
\
[00:24:15.220] - Meredith\
And next week is a video about how to create vinyl stickers with your cricket machine. And the week after that is about how to create stained glass window art or something. Right. These are all crafts.\
\
[00:24:27.530] - Meredith\
But they're also all over the place, and the problem with that is that if a viewer or one hundred or thousands of viewers find your scrunchie video through the search results, let's say, and it's really helpful and it's exactly what they want and they watch the whole thing and then click your links and they make purchases through your affiliate links. Right. What are the chances that those people, those viewers also want to do cricket stickers and stained glass window art?\
\
[00:25:02.480] - Meredith\
Who knows?\
\
[00:25:03.170] - Meredith\
Right. For all we know, none of them are interested in those topics.\
\
[00:25:07.400] - Meredith\
And you might be thinking, so what's the big deal? So the scrunchy people don't want to watch a cricket tutorial. They just don't watch it. The problem with that is two things.\
\
[00:25:17.360] - Meredith\
One, if they do click on your vinyl sticker tutorial and then they're like, why?\
\
[00:25:23.870] - Meredith\
This isn't what I wanted to see. I thought this was the scrunchie lady, they click off. And what does that tell You Tube? Your video is no good. No one wants to watch it. Your YouTube, YouTube, YouTube has zero incentive to show that vinyl sticker tutorial to more people within the algorithm. So it hurts your channel overall. But the second thing is that and this is more important by not making another scrunchy video or at least a hair accessory, sewing related video, then you're missing a huge opportunity to serve up content that these people who've you've already attracted want to watch.\
\
[00:26:11.610] - Meredith\
So this is how the spider web effect affects your channel, if you think of a spider, it weaves a spider web to catch her food and then when insects or bugs fly by, essentially get caught in the web and that's how she eats.\
\
[00:26:26.370] - Meredith\
So you want to kind of think of your YouTube channel and set it up to do the very same thing.\
\
[00:26:31.650] - Meredith\
So if you pretend the dots here, the the circular web on your screen, if you think of the dots are actual videos and they are all within one section of your spider web, when a potential viewer is searching for topics or even just browsing YouTube, you want them to find your videos. So you need to have a web of videos that's like so tight that your ideal viewer can't even browse YouTube without seeing your videos being recommended to them.\
\
[00:27:06.490] - Meredith\
So when your topics are scattered, there's not enough of a web there to catch people, it's just like a one off video about scrunches. People have no reason to stay. They have no reason to watch more of your videos because they came for the scrunches and you don't have any more videos about scrunches.\
\
[00:27:25.030] - Meredith\
So remember, YouTube wants to keep people watching YouTube videos. So we need to create videos that keep people on your channel, basically binge watching your videos or at the very least hitting the subscribe button so they can come back later and learn more from you. This is how you gain traction on YouTube quickly and build a profitable YouTube channel so that you can monetize your channel with ads and attract viewers who want to. I like to think of them as kind of like stay in your wake.\
\
[00:27:55.810] - Meredith\
They want to see what you're up to. They want to watch your videos. They subscribe to your emails. They join your Facebook group. They buy from your affiliate links. They join your online programs, they hire you for coaching, etc.. Now, one quick word about monetizing your channel with ads. In order to earn ad revenue through YouTube, you have to have 1000 YouTube subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. It's completely doable, you know, within a year or less if you follow a strategy and publish consistently.\
\
[00:28:30.940] - Meredith\
So how do you make this work for you in just an hour a day so that YouTube doesn't have to take over your whole entire life?\
\
[00:28:38.260] - Meredith\
So there's two two main processes for this. And these are just ideas. They, they should work. One of these should work for most people. But you can adapt these to your own lifestyle. So the first way is to plan and publish week by week. So if your video topics in your video style and your skills are such that the videos that you create are pretty easy to set up and record and edit, then you could spend an hour a day doing each phase.\
\
[00:29:11.140] - Meredith\
So let's say if you create tutorials where you're recording your screen or if you are doing like a like a craft tutorial where you're recording, you know, your hands and you can just kind of shoot an intro and outro with your face on camera or not even have your face on camera at all. Then on Sunday, you can plan your topic, do your keyword research, do your optimization, figure out what you're actually going to cover in the video.\
\
[00:29:38.590] - Meredith\
Like what am I actually going to say Monday? You can record when you use a block scripting process. It's super quick and easy. Tuesday you edit and when your videos are planned and scripted, editing is so much faster than winging it. And I hear all the time people are like, oh my gosh, it took me six hours to edit my video. My question is always, did you plan the video before you record it? Because a lot of times the answer is no.\
\
[00:30:06.370] - Meredith\
Let me just tell you, it is so much faster to edit a video when you have planned it out before you shot the video, because then it's just a matter of putting it all together. It's like building a scrapbook or something. Right. So by Wednesday, you can finalize your edit, make any polishing touches you can upload it to YouTube and get it ready to be published and turn it into a blog post or repurpose it, for example. You can, like, do all those kind of things and get it ready to go live and then say on Thursday you can hit publish.\
\
[00:30:41.790] - Meredith\
So, oops, let me go back.\
\
[00:30:43.380] - Meredith\
So if your videos take a little more time to create, if you have a lot of moving parts, if it's more of a process for you, like if you make cooking type of videos where you have actual ingredients in food that you have to prep in order to be ready to create your videos, then I would highly recommend that you plan on taking a whole day or even just an afternoon to shoot several videos at one time. You could do this maybe once a month.\
\
[00:31:13.290] - Meredith\
And so you can spend an hour a day up to that point, doing the planning. So doing your keyword research and optimization, scripting your videos, prepping to shoot the video and then spending a day or an afternoon actually doing the shoot. And then you can edit as you go or you can hire an editor to do that part of the process. This the process of creating videos is so personal. It's it's a little bit of art, it's a little bit of science.\
\
[00:31:45.030] - Meredith\
So it's a personal kind of creation, creative process for people. And as long as you're taking the right steps in the right direction, right. You're always moving forward. Nothing has to be perfect when you're just starting out and you have to remember that it's a creative process and it's OK to experiment and just try new things. So we dipped our toes into the search and rescue method to build your library oYouTube videos that get views and gain subscribers for weeks, months and years to come.\
\
[00:32:17.490] - Meredith\
Your next steps are from here to update your about page and your channel art based on the template inside of the workbook. Come up with five to 10 video topic ideas in one section of your spider web, just one section of your spider web and then the next steps from there would be to plan and create those videos.\
\
[00:32:40.960] - Meredith\
So, you know, with millions of views happening every hour on YouTube, the second largest search engine on the planet, nearly all of them come from search results and the recommendation algorithm.\
\
[00:32:52.780] - Meredith\
So even as you're watching this presentation right now, people that need your stuff, your content, your value are searching YouTube and they're finding something.\
\
[00:33:04.960] - Meredith\
They're finding someone and someone is earning revenue, talking about your niche right now.\
\
[00:33:11.170] - Meredith\
So the real question is, why not you? Right. And if you're someone who likes to follow a guided step by step process to achieve your goals in this case, to build a profitable YouTube channel, I invite you to hop on the wait list for the Video Pursuit Society, where I simply hand you the complete search and rescue method course, along with a monthly growth plan, template packs, expert masterclasses, support calls and a private community. So the search and rescue method, as you know, is the fastest way to grow your audience on YouTube by creating consistent weekly content to build your library of YouTube videos that get views and gain subscribers for weeks, months and years to come.\
\
[00:33:51.160] - Meredith\
And nothing is going to help you monetize your YouTube channel than a powerful YouTube strategy paired with multiple revenue streams and having the step by step plan plus the support and guidance will help you to avoid struggling through any roadblocks you might encounter because you simply don't know what you don't know.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:02.980] - Nadalie Bardo\
Hey there Blogger, Breakthrough Summit. It's Nadalie Bardo, your Pinterest Coach here, and I'm so excited to bring to you this brand new training. We're going to start with talking about why you really need Pinterest. This is how to forget Google and grow with Pinterest in 2025 and beyond. We need to talk about this. Major changes with the Google search algorithm in 2024. Sadly, many sites have lost all, most, or some of their organic search traffic. Here are just some snippets of what's been going on. You can see this Reddit post that says, I lost 95% of my traffic. That is major. As you can see right here, I have lost between 50% to 60% of my traffic depending on the day. I have definitely been hit by the search algorithm. However, thankfully, because of Pinterest, I have been able to maintain the majority of my passive income I was earning from my ad network. We have so many questions about this. We cannot understand how major these changes have been. What does this mean for us? To be clear, SEO is not dead, but Google search might be. With 91% of all search, Google is not the only search engine.\
\
[00:01:44.250] - Nadalie Bardo\
It's just the biggest. Okay, for now, anyways, there's lawsuits in the pipeline. People seem to be going for Google. We'll see how this all shakes out. Will Google search traffic ever recover? This might be a question you have. Honestly, I literally don't know, and I don't think anyone does. I don't even think Google knows. What can we do about it? Is there hope? You need to diversify your traffic sources, especially if Google is your primary source of leads, of clicks to your site. What are our options? Let's go over them. We have got Instagram, very much a influencer, hashtag-based platform. A lot of people are complaining about how the algorithm changes are really killing leads. We also have TikTok, so to be successful there, you've really got to be okay with doing video. We also have YouTube, which is also a search engine. It's also owned by Google. But once again, you've got to be good with creating video. We also have Facebook We all know that organic reach on Facebook is pretty much nonexistent. Instagram, Facebook, Meta, you're definitely going to have to run ads. We also have X. I don't know what's going on there.\
\
[00:03:15.360] - Nadalie Bardo\
I don't want to know. We also have Pinterest. Pinterest operates way differently than your other options, and I want to break it down for you. Your most reliable option is now Pinteresr. Why Pinterest? Not Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook. I want to break it down for you. Reason number one, Pinterest is a visual search engine. So remember, SEO is not dead. We're just moving away from Google. It's not social media. We're talking keywords, not hashtags. Plus, absolutely no engagement required. No going live either. You don't need to be social on Pinterest to be successful. There are 5 billion monthly searches on Pinterest and over 500 million active monthly users on Pinterest. The platform is growing. With 96 of Pinterest's top searches are unbranded. What does this mean for you? It means Pinterest is not dominated by big brands and influencers, like you might see on other platforms like Instagram. You know also how Google had become. The last few years, pretty much every search term was dominated by those huge publications. Even if it wasn't the best content, it would outrank. Reason number 2, Pinterest pins have the longest lifespan for posts, meaning you can create a pin once and it has the best chance of continual long-term traffic.\
\
[00:04:58.550] - Nadalie Bardo\
Pinterest pins can live Live, and by Live, we mean it's still getting views and clicks and engagement for four months to years. This pin, my number one pin for saved this month was added to Pinterest in 2017. Or this pin, which was added in 2020 and it got over 1,000 clicks this month. Yes, like how Google used to be before, where you You would create it, you would achieve the ranking, and you would just continue to get traffic. But better because you never have to update them. You never have to update your pins. Reason number 3, Pinterest users are trained to click and shop. Did you know, Pinterest users are more likely to purchase from you? Or that 75% of weekly Pinterest users say they're always shopping. And 50% of Pinterest users see the platform as a shopping destination. Also, one in three, Pinterest shoppers have an average annual income of 100K or more. There's more. Plus, Pinterest users spend 80% more per month than on other platforms. This is where the cash is. Shoppers on Pinterest spend twice as much as shoppers on other platforms. Okay, buckle in. Sounds great. That's why you need to focus on Pinterest and forget Google.\
\
[00:06:39.580] - Nadalie Bardo\
Here's how. Step one, you need to design Pinterest pins. Let's talk basics. Types of pins. We have got image pins, and we have got video pins, and we used to have idea pins, but thankfully, these have now been recategorized as video pins. We're talking about organic pins. These are unpaid pins, not ads. Let's talk pin dimensions. This is the size of the pins you'll be creating. For image pins, they are going to be vertical 2 by 3 ratio. Essentially, that's 1,000 by 1,500 pixels, JPEGs or PNGs. For video pins, we want to make sure they're also vertical 9 by 16 ratio, which is the same size as shorts, as reels, as TikTok videos. That's 1080 by 1920 pixels, and they want to be saved as MP4 videos. You can design pins with a free graphic design tool like Canva. Canva is amazing. Use it to design your pins. Let's take a look at this. For example, I really encourage you to create some high converting templates that you can easily use to update and create multiple new pins. Essentially, when you have your templates, you're just going to be swapping in new text and changing the images.\
\
[00:08:08.940] - Nadalie Bardo\
Just like me as I'm updating these pins for a new blog post, it took me about a minute, a pin, to design seven new pins for my content. It just is so much easier. This is the post that I'm designing for. It's so much easier when you're working from templates because you are not staring at a blank screen. You're not wasting time trying to figure out what should my pins look like. You have these templates that you can easily use and update for your content in just a few clicks. That's a look at Canva. Pro tip, you're going to save time by using pin templates. Just swap out the text and the images like this. We can see here, these are my pins. You can see I'm working I'm working with seven templates that I update for every single post that I have. I encourage you to not copy anyone else's designs. It's low-key theft and very uncool. You can purchase templates or use the ones they have in Canva. So don't start from scratch. Once you have your templates, update them quickly and easily. For example, you would just update your templates. We're not starting from scratch.\
\
[00:09:30.520] - Nadalie Bardo\
Here are a few more examples. You're just going to update your templates for your new content. A pro tip, design pins that look like ranking pins for the keyword you're targeting. For example, when we search Amsterdam, you can see that a lot of these pins look very similar. I've just blocked out the ads. That's what the spaces are. Or for this one, on smart goals, you can see all the ranking pins are very similar, including one of my own. You can see here for this travel bag, all the ranking pins look similar. So pretty pins are just part of it. Step two, you need to optimize pins for SEO. Let's break it down. Like any search engine, keywords are the language of Pinterest, and they're how your pins get found in search. You first need to find the right keywords to target on Pinterest. Then optimize your pins with that keyword in all the right places. This is how you search. We are going to use Pinterest Trends. That's one tool where you can access. This is a free tool accessible with any Pinterest business account. Or you can use the Pinterest search bar to find keywords.\
\
[00:10:50.870] - Nadalie Bardo\
For example, here are some pins that are ranking for how to meditate for beginners. You want to make sure once you find When you're in that keyword, you're going to add it to your pin. Let's take a look at one of my pins that's ranking. It's called How to Meditate for Beginners. I'm going to show you where I would put these keywords. For example, you want to make sure it's in your pin title. Pin titles and pin descriptions are almost like the open graph title or metadata you would add to any of your product or blog post pages. We also want to make sure it's in our description. It's in our linking URL. Out. If it's a product or if it's a blog post, whatever you're linking to, you want that keyword in the URL. It's also right on my image, how to meditate. It's also the board my pin is saved to. If you're not familiar with Pinterest boards, think of them as folders for your content. However you organize your products or your content, you want that to be reflected on Pinterest using keywords for those boards or folder names. It's in our alt text, and it's also going to be in the topic tags that are added to our pins.\
\
[00:12:11.040] - Nadalie Bardo\
Topic tags are like modern version of hashtags. They're predefined by Pinterest and you add them to your pins. That's not all. Use the keywords to guide you in your content and product creation. Where possible, use trend graph data to tell you When to Create What. This is a trend graph that you can find right inside Pinterest Trends. It's a completely free tool. We can see for this keyword, which is meditation, that search peaks right in January. By using this data, it's going to help you to plan your content and to plan your products or your promotions. Here's another example for small business. We can see right here, it peaks in around August. You would be creating content ahead of August so that it gets on Pinterest in time. I would usually count forward around 2-3 months. Using trend data, you're able to predict when keywords are going to peak. Here's another example for you where you can see that sometimes keywords have a peak, but sometimes it's a very subtle one and it's more consistent throughout the year. Either way, use this data to inform when you create what. Use your research to create content like blog posts, podcasts, YouTube videos, shorts, and products.\
\
[00:13:42.760] - Nadalie Bardo\
Now, let's finish up. You ready? Step three, save or schedule pins. It's time to get your pins on Pinterest. Ways to Pin. Okay, on one side, you can pin directly on Pinterest itself as the website website, but you could also pin with a Pinterest scheduler like Tailwind, for example. If you're using the Pinterest website, you can only pin 30 days in advance. You would be able to pin 30 days from the day you're posting, and you can only schedule a maximum of 50 pins at a time. With Tailwind, the limits are based on your own plan. For example, if you're on the base plan, maybe you're only able to schedule schedule 30 pins a month, but you're able to schedule those pins out as far as you would like, and like Tailwind has a free plan. It just depends on your needs, your budget, and which of these tools you want to pin with. It's less about which way is better and more about what works for you. What works for your budget? What works for your workflow? Do you want to only schedule 30 days out at a time? Do you want to get farther ahead?\
\
[00:15:00.110] - Nadalie Bardo\
It's up to you. But it's more about following the best practices for pinning than how you pin. It's very important that you don't break the rules. There are many unwritten rules you need to know and follow to be successful on Pinterest. Otherwise, it won't work for you and you could get in trouble with Pinterest. But don't worry, don't panic. It's okay. All right, are you listening up? Are you listening up? Here are the basics that you need to know. Number one, pin at least one new pin per day on Pinterest to start. That's one brand new image that's never been added to Pinterest before. Start with at least one. When you have capacity, you can increase to two or three. I would never pin more than, say, seven. Seven seems like a lot when it comes to Pinterest these days. Number two, never repin your pins again. Save them only once. Once. You do all the work upfront, you design an amazing graphic, you make sure you've optimized it, you save it to the best board, and you walk away. That's it. You only pin it once. You're going to wait seven days to share the same link again on Pinterest.\
\
[00:16:17.240] - Nadalie Bardo\
We're not repinning identical pins, but you can go save an additional pin to the same link. If you wait seven days, let that link cool off before you add it We don't want to appear scammy or spammy on Pinterest. You should design multiple pins per link and spread them out on Pinterest. That's why I encourage you to have templates that you can easily use to update for all of the new links you create, like this. Maybe week one this goes out, and then week two, and then week three, and then week four, and week five. Five, and week six. You get it? Then week seven, and then week eight, and then week nine. A pro tip. Start with five or so pins for your new links. If it as well, then design more pins. Say, for example, you are creating blog posts. You can start with just a few pin templates for your blog post. If your pin takes off or if that particular link is very popular, then go design more pins. For example, if this is the top pin on your account, great. Go design more pins and space them out. For example, we had one pin.\
\
[00:17:43.440] - Nadalie Bardo\
It did fairly well. We're going to go design multiple pins per link and space those out seven days to help to build traction because we validated that, yes, this content is what people want. People are clicking on it, so let's give them more. Then, if you're lucky, you'll have multiple pins ranking in search for the same keyword, meaning that you're going to get even more clicks. Remember this screenshot? These are my pins in the first and the third position, meaning that if maybe one pin isn't appealing, maybe the second one is. Also, if you scroll throughout the results, you'll see even more of my pins. Okay? You all get it? I hope so. But don't worry, if you need help, if you have questions, you're definitely going to want to click and get your free Pinterest best practices cheat sheet. I've broken down in detail everything I've shared with you in this class so that you can print this out, you can refer to it, and you can ensure that you are pinning in a successful way that is going to bring you traffic, subscribers, and sales.

[00:00:13.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Hey, guys. I'm really excited for our next speaker. She's going to be talking about YouTube, which is something I'm working on improving myself. She is a lawyer, a mental health advocate, and a booktuber. Please welcome Rachel Eyo to the Summit. Rachel, thanks for being here.\
\
[00:00:32.910] - Rachel\
Thank you. Thank you for having me. So excited to meet you. \
\
[00:00:36.460] - Liz\
Yeah. So first I feel like, quick question on your background. What is a booktuber? I feel like a lot of people may not know.\
\
[00:00:46.230] - Rachel\
Yeah. Okay. So a booktuber is basically somebody who creates videos that are book related on YouTube. So I am a booktuber. I principally create videos on YouTube that are centered around book. So book reviews, book recommendations, reading recommendations, book challenges, or fun ways to do that. So that's basically what booktuber does on YouTube.\
\
[00:01:12.280] - Liz\
Okay. So for those when you get started with YouTube, what is sort of the first step they should take? \
\
[00:01:21.170] - Rachel\
Yeah. So if someone wants to get started with YouTube, whether it's BookTubing or just YouTube in general, I think the first thing that they should do is just actually start. A lot of people don't like, want to start and then they don't know how to start. They want to get all the right equipment. You want to get cameras or lighting or things like that.I started with my phone and natural light. I didn't even have a ring light. I just started with my phone and so I just started.\
\
[00:01:53.860] - Rachel\
But in deciding what part of YouTube I wanted to be in, I had to do a little bit of research because I am very passionate about books. I love to read. And I decided that I was just going to sort of niche down into books and maybe some other things as well.\
\
[00:02:11.540] - Rachel\
So I would suggest that, first of all, you not only start with where you are, in terms of what equipment you have. Maybe it's your phone or your tripod or whatever, you don't have to have the most expensive gadgets. That's where you can start. And you can also do some research to see what people are in certain fields are passionate about. It could be make up, film, it could be books, it could be nature.\
\
[00:02:50.910] - Rachel\
Whatever it is that you like to talk about or record, you can do some research and also just try to narrow it down so that your channel is not focused on so many things at once.\
\
[00:03:08.470] - Liz\
Okay. So, you say do research. Are you researching on YouTube? Are you using a tool?\
\
[00:03:16.150] - Rachel\
Okay. So to answer your question in terms of research, yes, it will be helpful to do research on YouTube. You're doing research on YouTube to find out what type of videos people are creating in a field that you might be very passionate about. You want to find out how well those videos are doing. If you want a large subscriber account, especially if you're just starting out, you want to be in a popular area of YouTube. It would be great to do some research on YouTube and then you can also do some research on normal search engines like Google, just to find out how successful people are doing in that field that you might want to get into in YouTube. So YouTube and Google and other search engines. \
\
[00:04:00.950] - Liz\
Okay. So when you're looking at YouTube and you're trying to see how well a topic is doing, what are you looking at? Are you looking at someone's subscriber count? Are you looking at views? What is your main focus?\
\
[00:04:12.910] - Rachel\
Yeah, we're looking at views. We're looking at the words that are being used on the title of the videos, if the words are like catchy enough, the way the video is made. So with book tubing, for example, some people have sit down videos where you sit down and you just talk about a book, you have your bookshelf behind you and you're talking about a book that you really love. Or you can have a reading blog where you vlog your experiences. Maybe you went to a bookstore or you met up with a friend that loves to talk about books. So you sort of want to know what kind of videos are being created. And then yes, you can look at the views and maybe the subscriber counts, but that's for when you've gone far at the beginning stage, it's quite slow, especially with BookTube.\
\
[00:05:01.430] - Liz\
Okay, so you're doing kind of keyword research.\
\
[00:05:03.460] - Rachel\
Yes.\
\
[00:05:03.800] - Liz\
So that was kind of one of the other questions I had. How long does it take to see traction? Is there ways to speed that up?\
\
[00:05:11.810] - Rachel\
Well, definitely. I'll say the best way to speed that up. The truth is you have to go through the process. I mean, a few people have videos that go viral the first time they post on YouTube, right? And some people call it beginners luck. Some people will be like, "Well, I've been on YouTube for five years. I only have ten subscribers."\
\
[00:05:31.050] - Rachel\
But I will say, especially because I do booktube in a genre, that is not very popular. I talk a lot about African literature and literature in general, but I would say the best way to speed it up will be to post consistently. As a person beginning on YouTube, beginner, you have to post consistently. You have to upload consistently. You have to be able to interact with other fellow YouTubers, preferably smaller YouTubers, because they're the ones who want to connect and network with you. But maybe three to four times if it's possible a week when you're just starting. Because if you do once a week, people tend to forget about you because you're yet to make your name. And then the YouTube algorithm is yet to sort of recognize you or refer you to other YouTubers or people who watch YouTube a lot. So posting consistently would definitely help to speed up. That growth.\
\
[00:06:31.890] - Liz\
Okay, SEO, when you're doing the research, you mentioned, what kind of words are they using as kind of keywords because YouTube is its own search engine. Is there a way you're kind of tracking keywords or keeping a list for video ideas. What do you recommend?\
\
[00:06:49.470] - Rachel\
Okay, well, so for me personally, I know I downloaded Tube Buddy. I'm not like an ambassador or anything, but I think that there are some apps that help you with keyword, maybe optimization and search engine. Just to tell you what words on YouTube will have a lot of views. What the SEO might look like if you actually released a video with a certain title that had a keyword.\
\
[00:07:16.290] \
So, I personally, I used Tube Buddy. So when I'm uploading, I'm able to see if I want to put a tag. I'm able to see how popular those keywords are. When I've uploaded the video, I go back and I'm able to see what my SEO score is. It's like out of 100. So if the words in the title are not that popular, I probably get 17 out of 100. And if it's really popular, maybe like 95 out of 100 So yeah, so maybe using YouTube related apps could help in terms of determining what words are popular out there. But I personally used Tube Buddy. I think there are a bunch of other ones out there. I don't know about them.\
\
[00:07:55.110] - Liz\
Yeah, no, there's lots of different tools. Okay. So when you're a beginner, obviously you're not going to qualify for ads on YouTube overnight. That's a requirement of like 1000 subscribers, 400,000 watch time hours? What is it...\
\
[00:08:13.650] - Rachel\
4000 hours\
\
[00:08:15.270] - Liz\
...4000 hours over the course of a year. But you can certainly monetize in other ways. How do you recommend beginners try to monetize their YouTube channel to make it worth their while, while they're building up.\
\
[00:08:29.490] - Rachel\
Right. Okay, so, I would first say that when you're beginning YouTube, it's really advisable that you don't really like go into it saying, "Oh my goodness, I was doing this for money and money alone." Because usually what draws people who are willing to maybe spend money or sponsor something that you would have are often drawn to someone's passion and their expression. So, I think that other ways that people can monetize is they can probably have sponsorship. People tend to sponsor like they'll give you an item and sponsor your video to get to talk about it, maybe for a few minutes. You can put this at the beginning of your video or at the end of your video. If you also have a large following on social media, maybe you can have like an influencer post where you can put up a post on your stories, on your feed, on Instagram or Twitter or whatever. And then people can see that and they can pay you for that. Also, you can have maybe like a newsletter or maybe an email subscription where people can subscribe to your email every month. They get to keep up with you and see how you're doing. And you give them exclusive content where they can have access to the other subscribers may not.\
\
[00:09:54.430] - Rachel\
And then you have things like the Patreon. You have, Get a Cup of Coffee, (BuyMeACoffee) a lot of creators often use that when they're not monetized. So people can actually send you money. People will even do just the normal when you click a link, somebody can send you money just to support your creative journey. If you can't have a Patreon or I know there are some countries that can have Patreon or maybe grab a coffee, that kind of thing. So those are things that people can actually explore if they're trying to monetize to make it their well. And you would just be surprised. A lot of people will vibe with your content and want to support your creative journey and just help out with that.\
\
[00:10:32.370] - Liz\
Awesome. Okay, so what are some tips you have for beginner bloggers, that may not be obvious. I know the first summit I ever did, one of the tips was to send a default description. It was like, life changing for me. So what are some tips? Sort of some things that maybe you do on Default that a beginner may not realize they could do.\
\
[00:10:56.490] - Rachel\
Okay, well, when you say Default, I did have to do research to learn some of these things. So I think maybe three major ones were on Default was just to be myself in expressing myself and creating my content, being authentic and following what I'm really passionate about. There's that temptation to look at what other people are doing, other people with higher subscriber counts and high views and say, oh, that's what I want to do. Meanwhile, you have no passion for it or you're not even interested in talking about it. A lot of people need to provide with authenticity, so you have to be authentic. I feel like that's one major thing for me.\
\
[00:11:40.010] - Rachel\
And another one was in terms of edits, or you know, the best camera or whatever. But the way you edit, that's one thing I learned at the beginning. The way you edit really helps people to stay longer, to watch your videos. So you want to edit in an entertaining way in terms of, you don't want to have like a really long, drawn-out video where you're thinking about something, that is taking you three minutes to come up with it and you leave that part in the video. You should be able to edit that out so that people see that in a fun way. And if you have blocks, you can edit that in an entertaining way.\
\
[00:12:12.180] - Rachel\
And I think another tip for me that, well, maybe it wasn't like really Default, I guess was. One tip that I really practiced when I first started was to learn patience like to be patient. Because everybody wants to grow to 5000 subscribers within the first week. Everybody wants to grow to 10,000 within the first month. But I had to sort of like learn that patience and take it one step at a time. And just while I'm doing that, I'm also prioritizing my mental health and taking time off while I'm creating what I love to create. So, yeah, those three things were key to me at the beginning.\
\
[00:12:52.180] - Liz\
Yeah. I'm like, don't beat yourself up over it. The thing is, I always have to. It's a lesson I've learned is you can put in all the work and effort, but you can't control the outcome. So just...\
\
[00:13:05.380] - Rachel\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:06.430] - Liz\
Don't beat yourself up if the outcome isn't what you hoped.\
\
[00:13:10.090] - Rachel\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:13.310] - Liz\
Okay, so what are some of the biggest mistakes you see or you think beginners make when getting started with YouTube?\
\
[00:13:25.890] - Rachel\
Yeah, I think that people come into, like I said, YouTube thinking, I just want to make that money and I'm going to make it the first time. And it's not bad to have that view. But I think that the number one thing is it sort of shows when you are not really being passionate about what you're talking about, you're not interested in it and you're in some weird way, it shows. So I think that one mistake would be to come into YouTube or video blogging saying, you know what, I'm just coming into it for the money and I don't really care so much about anything like that. And you can see that in the video.So I would say to correct that mistake, like I had said earlier, make sure that you're talking about something that you're passionate about. You're creating videos on things that you're passionate about.\
\
[00:14:09.920] - Rachel\
Another mistake would be to not actively engage with other smaller YouTubers. You're coming in as a small YouTuber. You only have five subscribers. A lot of people stay in their own corners and then you're not able to grow because you don't have generating subscribers. So to correct that, it's best to go to like, what would you call it? Smaller YouTubers that create similar content, go on their comment page, don't spam their comment section, but watch their videos, leave meaningful comments, try to connect with them and see how that goes so that you can grow your content.\
\
[00:14:51.590] - Rachel\
I think a third one would be what we call sub for sub, where you just want to go really fast. And so, it's called subscriber for subscriber. So you see a lot of smaller YouTubers because you don't want to be patient to create content and grow. You then start trying to have a group of people where they subscribe to your channel. You subscribe back, they don't watch your content, you don't watch theirs. You're just trying to grow your subscriber count. What happens that YouTube eventually finds out anyways and then cuts them off? So they might even suspend you, especially if you're doing that a lot. They might suspend your channel or they might give you strikes. They might say, oh, you violated community guidelines. So that is a very big mistake that a lot of new YouTubers use, especially when they're not trying to be patient. We call it sub for sub. Yeah.\
\
[00:15:43.110] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even if you're trying to grow only follow people, you're actually going to watch their stuff that you're interested in.\
\
[00:15:46.670] - Rachel\
Exactly, exactly, exactly. \
\
[00:15:49.810] - Liz\
For sure. So, I want to take a step back because you mentioned editing, because obviously you can start with just your camera or your phone, rather camera. But editing can be a little daunting. What tools or resources do you recommend to learn how to edit and to do the actual editing?\
\
[00:16:14.810] - Rachel\
Right. Okay, so when I first started, I use an iPhone. So when I first started, I started using editing with the Imovie. It comes with the iPhone, I think. So it's an Imovie app. It's very basic, very simple, easy to use if you're just trying to start out with editing.\
\
[00:16:32.270] - Rachel\
I had no prior experience with editing videos, so I was learning as I was going and I was like, "You know what? I'm not going to wait until it's perfect." Your first couple of videos will be terrible, so don't even try to make it perfect, except your professional video editor.\
\
[00:16:48.380] - Rachel\
But currently, on my phone, I use KineMaster. That's another app that people can try out. K-I-N-E. Master is one word. So I use that to edit, and it's pretty simple. You can edit on the go. If it's on your phone, you don't have to have your laptop with you. So if you shoot the videos on your phone, you can edit on your phone, send it to your phone. If you can even upload on your phone, fine. But sometimes I have to send to my laptop and then I do that.\
\
[00:17:16.530] - Rachel\
So I would recommend those two. If you don't have any prior experience with editing videos and you're just trying to learn on the go. Of course, there's a whole lot of other editing apps out there. There's a lot of them that even go on your laptop. If you have a laptop and you like to edit. I don't really know about those ones. I'm yet to try them out, but I would say for it beginner these two are perfectly fine. \
\
[00:17:45.570] - Liz\
Yeah, I use Imovie to edit most of my stuff, to be perfectly honest. I'm not super fancy, but I use YouTube to figure out how to do things in it. Just very full circle there. Okay, YouTube is your friend when you're trying to learn.\
\
[00:18:09.330] - Rachel\
Just to add that if somebody's trying to learn how to edit or once recommend literally just Google. How can I edit this? Like the things that you find on Google and YouTube, you'll be so amazed. Like, even if you go, how can I put a laughing sound behind what I'm saying? How can I put like a clapping effect or an animated effect? Just type, no matter how crazy it sounds, you'll get at least 500 results and you can click on it and learn how to edit and add things and remove thing. (inaudible) So the Internet today is a lovely place.\
\
[00:18:57.490] - Liz\
Yes. Lots of people share their knowledge for free to help you learn. So definitely do that. Okay, so I feel like we've covered a good amount of ground. Any final words of advice or things people should know if they're getting started with YouTube.\
\
[00:19:14.710] - Rachel\
Yeah. So like I said, create what you're passionate about. Have fun while you're creating videos. Be authentic, stay true to yourself. Of course upload frequently and try to be consistent.\
\
[00:19:29.250] - Rachel\
But most importantly prioritize your mental health when you're creating, if you feel really overwhelmed or burned out, take a break and be okay with taking breaks. Of course, don't compare yourself to another YouTuber who has been there for like five years and you just started five months. You're already feeling pressured.\
\
[00:19:52.150] - Rachel\
Take it one day at a time and of course the last thing I would say is just to be patient with yourself, be patient and see the results. Like you said, you can't control the outcome, put in as much as you can and just see how it goes. So I think just be patient with yourself as you create.\
\
[00:20:10.630] - Liz\
Fantastic. All right. And if those watching want to connect more with you, how can they do that? Where can they find you?\
\
[00:20:18.260] - Rachel\
Yeah, so I'm on Instagram and Twitter Rachel Eyo. @racheleyo_ on Instagram and Twitter and RachelEyo on YouTube. R-A-C-H-E-L-E-Y-O. So you can subscribe to my YouTube. I have more reading tips, book recommendations and lots of fun videos that you can watch.\

[00:00:09.700] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
All right, guys, I'm super excited for today's session with my friend Tasha from One Big Happy Life. Tasha, welcome and thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:16.720] - Tasha Cochran, onebighappylife.com\
Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here. I love talking about YouTube. So I guess I'll start off by telling you just a little bit about me.\
\
[00:00:25.540] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:00:25.750] - Tasha\
So, my name is Tasha Cochran. I am a lawyer and a wealth expert, and my business is One Big Happy Life. And it started out entirely as a YouTube channel where I was talking about hair, of all things, and then it evolved into a personal finance and lifestyle design channel, which then my whole business grew out of. And now I run a multiple six figure business, which is really, really exciting. Over the past four years, I have been able to work with brands like Google and Sony and Adobe as brand partners for all my YouTube channel, we have over 17 million views and my YouTube channel is how I grow my audience and also find customers for our paid products; people who want to go deeper with us on the topics that we share about on YouTube.\
\
[00:01:20.300] - Liz\
You started YouTube kind of- do you want to talk mainly about sort of YouTube versus blogging and how they can go hand in hand or where they don't or your thoughts?\
\
[00:01:30.760] - Tasha\
Yeah, so the power of YouTube, at least especially for me, I love to write, but I am someone that gets writer's block like nobody's business. And so a blog post can take me a really long time to write, whereas very few people get speakers block, talkers block. And so for me, I just found that it was so much easier for me to get my ideas out on video with just a basic outline than it was to write a blog post. But the really powerful thing about YouTube in particular over blogging is that when you blog, okay, now you've got your content, but then you've got to figure out a way to push it out there. Right, and get it in front of eyes. So you either got to add on SEO or Pinterest or some other sort of social media marketing or paid advertising. But with YouTube, you have the YouTube algorithm, which is Google working for you right where you can show up in Google search. You show up on YouTube search because YouTube is a search platform. And it's constantly serving even your old content to new people. So, it's very much an evergreen platform. So that's why I prefer YouTube over blogging. But I also recognize and everyone should recognize that you don't own YouTube. So be very careful about building your audience and your entire business on some other platform that you don't own.\
\
[00:02:55.510] - Tasha\
You do on your blog. And so it's a great opportunity to put the two of them together so you can embed your videos on your blog, which gives your blog also SEO juice. Right. Because that's that additional asset in there.\
\
[00:03:08.590] - Liz\
Time on page.\
\
[00:03:08.740] - Tasha\
Exactly. And a lot of people, too, when they watch your videos on YouTube, some people like to read what you say, even after they've watched you say it, they want to go deeper. So it gives them this extra bit of value add to say, "Hey, go on over to my website and I've got it all written out for you in the blog post. You can follow it step by step and also opt in to my email list and get tagged by my Facebook pixel so that you can stay in my universe. There you go.\
\
[00:03:38.360] - Liz\
Yes. Okay, so I think one of the things that overwhelms people with doing video and YouTube is, you know, they feel scared of editing video and staying consistent, like "I can edit something out. Right. I've been doing that since third grade," you know. But video, how do you stay consistent with that? And like do how many systems in place that help you kind of stay on track of everything and keep it simple?\
\
[00:04:02.320] - Tasha\
Yes. So I can't see that video can be really challenging to stay on top of, especially for women when we feel like we have to present a certain made up face and hair done. And what are we wearing on video? And of course, that's entirely a style preference, right? Because you absolutely can show up on video, no makeup, same clothes every time, if that is your brand. But for someone like me, wear my brand looks like this. It takes probably about 35/40 minutes just for me to even get ready to show up on video. And so the key is to batch record. So, ideally if I'm putting on makeup, we're shooting three or four videos right. And so if- and then the next thing comes into play is your posting frequency. So to start out you only need to post, let's say, once a week. So if you can batch shoot four videos at a time, then it's like one set of work because you sit down and you shoot four videos and sure, all four can look exactly like the same outfit they make up. I think that's an. I really find I usually will switch out my shirt. But batch working is a great way to stay consistent. The other thing is keeping a never ending list of ideas. So, don't try to sit down and come up with an idea right then when you're about to shoot or you need to come up with four ideas because you're going to shoot in an hour. No, have a never ending list of ideas that you keep a running list of and so then when you're ready, you can just select your favorite ones in that moment from that list so that you're not trying to both be entirely creative and come up with things from scratch and also outlining those things and fleshing them out into full ideas.\
\
[00:05:49.210] - Tasha\
The other thing that I suggest is to have a set. So this is a set. It looks like this all the time. It's also known as my dining room. Here is my dining room table. And so it's just one wall of the house that we've made to look appealing for video so that we can just drop in and shoot a video whenever. So, I can go from not ready to shoot a video to ready to shoot a video excluding makeup in like two seconds, because all I have to do is turn all the lights on. So, you've just got to decide that video is going to be your thing and set yourself up for success by making everything easy and streamlined.\
\
[00:06:32.120] - Liz\
Yeah, so one thing I want to follow up on is once you have the idea outlining, I tend to work well from an outline and just talking through it. I don't necessarily need a full script. I know some people do. What are your thoughts on that on Teleprompter's? How simple or complicated does it need to be? I mean, different people have different needs, but...\
\
[00:06:54.050] - Tasha\
Yeah, so I have done it both ways for my own YouTube channel, we almost never use a teleprompter. The only time we'll ever use a teleprompter is sometimes when we work with brands, especially if it's a medical related brand or like health care or something like that or a bank. They are very specific about the words that they want you to use. And so we will read any branded part of the video directly from the teleprompter in those instances, because we can't just wing it because they will literally ask for a reshoot for one word. But most of the time on our own channel, what we have is an outline. And typically it used to be that Joseph and I would shoot videos together. And so when two people are shooting a video, you don't need as detailed an outline, because when one person is talking, the other person is thinking. But as I started shooting more and more videos by myself because I went full time in the business and Joseph is still working full time. So now the videos are like ninety five percent, just me. I found that I needed a more detailed outline so that my thoughts could flow better. But I generally do not prefer to write everything out word for word because it is very hard to read from a teleprompter and come across as convincing. I can do it now because I spent a year shooting a YouTube video show for the financial diet where I chose to fully scripted out because I didn't have a lot of time because I was still working full time. And over time I learned to read and have people not be able to tell that I was reading because I learned how to modulate my voice and also write better for a teleprompter. But it is way more work. It's a lot easier to just master the art of being able to speak on the fly. And the way that you do that is by just doing it. Your early videos, they're going to suck. So, if you really...\
\
[00:08:49.620] - Liz\
Go to your early blog post. Right, so same thing.\
\
[00:08:51.790] - Tasha\
Exactly. If you go to my early YouTube videos, one thing that I discovered very early on was the like the RBF, the resting bee face, like you cannot just be a normal person on video. You come across as really boring, but you don't know that at first. So, like my first YouTube videos, I'd be like this and I would talk like this before for a regular person is fine, but for video that is not fine. But it took me at this point we've made over four hundred videos, so the early ones suck. But I got better and better and better. And I got better at my messaging too, because I would watch the videos and say, "Okay, how did I say that? How could I have said that better? And so then you just get better on the fly."\
\
[00:09:35.220] - Liz\
Okay? Yeah. No, I do like that. So- and one thing and tell me if you do this, if you're recording, if you make a mistake, you just pause and go again and edit that out? Is that something that could save you a lot of time? I think people try to get everything perfect.\
\
[00:09:49.130] - Tasha\
Yes. So we are fairly lucky in that we tend to not have as many cuts. I have more cuts now when it's me by myself, because I forget what the next thing was that I was going to talk about. So, I have these pauses, but that's actually not a bad thing. A lot of video editors prefer to have more cuts in a video. So, we still do a lot of our own editing in-house. But sometimes we will have video editors edit for us and they're like, "Well, there weren't too many cuts in there. So, I added some visual interest because people are used to seeing changes a lot in television. So watching something where you're just sitting there for eight minutes straight talking, even if you're incredibly entertaining, is a little strange for people. So it's totally OK if you go a minute and then there was a cut because it's just like little it's called an in and out cut. So it's just these tiny little cuts that actually feel very natural to people. The only time that the cuts matter is like Facebook.\
\
[00:10:48.710] - Tasha\
So, you can repurpose your YouTube videos and also put them up on your Facebook business page. And so Facebook tends to like more like people on Facebook, tend to like the more live streaming videos that are that don't seem pre-recorded ones. If you. Yeah. So if you have a cut in a Facebook video, then it seems pre-recorded, then you really need to take your editing up a notch to make it look like a purposeful edit. Right. It's just like different takes Facebook versus YouTube. But even still, we throw our YouTube videos up on Facebook. We use them for like for ads and things like that, and they perform very well. So I would say give yourself some grace, allow yourself to have cuts, but I would say not too many cuts. So maybe try to keep your cuts, at least give them like a good thirty seconds. If you didn't talk for thirty seconds, then you're better off just starting from the beginning and saying it again.\
\
[00:11:44.510] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay, so then once I think people can figure out, OK, I've got an outline, there's a gazillion things you can use to record your phone. A photo booth on Mac, I'm sure there's an equivalent on PC. What do you once you've recorded. what do you do with the video? Where should you edit it? Editors can be overwhelming, you know- what- like for people just getting started. What would you suggest?\
\
[00:12:09.650] - Tasha\
So I will say that I have edited using Premier pro basically from the beginning. Now, in the very, very beginning, I had a Mac, so I used iMovie, but it was a MacBook Air and a MacBook Air cannot handle at least back then. I don't know what's going on with them right now. Couldn't really handle what I was trying to put them- put it through, which is basically simple cut. Now the great thing about iMovie is that it has some fun little- you can do things like add little end screens and add little titles in very easily where you as that is incredibly difficult to do in premier. Like you've got to know what you're doing and chances are you might even need to pull in after effects to get that to work. So that's the downside of premier pro. But you don't need any of that fancy stuff to be successful on YouTube. I still don't do any of the fancy graphics and editing on my video because I fully believe in that Parado principle. The 80/20 like 20% of your work gets you 80% of the result. And so I think that those fancy things are like part of that extra 20% that you don't even need when you're starting out too fancy.\
\
[00:13:19.250] - Tasha\
But I do like Premier Pro because I personally feel that it is very easy to use. You don't have to use any of the bells and whistles, but is very easy to use. And I like using kind of doing things right from the very beginning versus going with the cheapest thing and then having to do all these work arounds and spending time, which is a finite resource, when you could be spending money, which is infinite. So, I like Premier Pro, but having said that, there are free ones out there or cheaper ones like Mobaby, I think is one of them. Filmora. It's hard for me to say because I don't use them, but here's what I say- just keep it simple. You do not need a whole bunch of fancy editing. You don't need scribbles. You don't need titles. You don't need any of that stuff when you are just starting out. Don't let that stop you from getting started. All you really need is to sit down, shoot your video, do your intro, give your- tell them what you're going to be talking. First of all, tell them what you're going to be talking about. Do your intro, deliver your main content, have a call to action at the end and you're done. Right. You can add all of that other stuff later.\
\
[00:14:32.690] - Liz\
Yes. Okay. So, a couple follow up questions based on some of the things you said, what would you suggest? I know some people do storage on like external hard drives versus a computer. Is that something you recommend?\
\
[00:14:46.290] - Tasha\
So, we have done things a lot of different ways. It's been many a year now since we've been making YouTube videos. And so when we started, we edited on laptops. We still can edit on laptops. We just get really powerful PCs . And I know a lot of people are Mac people. And so they think that Macs are actually the better machine, but they're not when you're looking at high end specs. Right. So all of our laptops outperform high end Macs and they cost well, our desktop cost more than the highest end Mac. But like our laptops will cost less than the highest in Mac, but have better specs. So, that's why we are a PC business vs. an Apple business, because we do so much video editing. But ideally, you want to edit your video on the hard- on the local hard drive, because that puts having the video on an external hard drive just puts more of a demand on your computer. So you just need enough space on your local hard drive for you to transfer those videos over and edit that when you're done editing them, then you can save them on an external hard drive. You do not want to keep them on your computer because they take up a ton of space.\
\
[00:16:05.850] - Tasha\
So, we actually have multiple servers in our house to store all of our because all of our videos for 4K, which is like four times the size of standard HD and over the years that stuff adds up and I haven't been wanting to get rid of any of the footage. And so here we are like I don't even know how many terabytes later of storage trying to keep up with it. But just to start out, start with like a one terabyte external hard drive, they're like 100 bucks- it's not cheap at all- not expensive at all.\
\
[00:16:36.930] - Liz\
They're like cheaper now like 50 or 60.\
\
[00:16:38.130] - Tasha\
Oh really?\
\
[00:16:38.790] - Liz\
Yes. And black- you know, like you look at sales, Black Friday, New Year, holiday sales, like you could find them cheaper.\
\
[00:16:46.020] - Tasha\
Exactly. And you could also choose to not keep all of your original footage. It's not- see, we did, especially in the beginning we were doing a lot of family vlogs and things like that. We did brand partnerships with Visit Florida. So we went down to the Florida Keys and have all kinds of footage as a family there. So it's almost like home movies that I don't want to get rid of. But for you, like our talk or videos where I'm like, you know, five ways to build wealth this year, we can get rid of that corporate and just keep the final file. Right, the final rendered video. So that can save you a ton of space, too.\
\
[00:17:22.620] - Liz\
Yeah, Okay. And then the other question I wanted to follow-up on, I feel like sound is the most important part because people kind of listen and work on something like they won't necessarily be watching you hard core. So, sound like I'm no sound expert. I mostly am like remove background noise and make sure it's not too loud, you know, any tips on sort of the sound to make sure that you have a good consistent sound?\
\
[00:17:46.830] - Tasha\
Yes. The closer the mic is to your mouth, the better your sound will be. So, in this case, with a zoom call, I actually I'm going to try to pick this up and hope that it doesn't make too much noise. But you can see I'm bringing this closer to my mouth and it sounds a little different. It sounds better, right? I don't have to speak as loud. And then when I take it further away, I have to raise my voice. But then that introduces more noise into the room. So the Yeti, the blue Yeti is what I use for live streaming. And if I'm live streaming in this room because I actually now have a second set in my office right at my office desk with a Podcast mic. But I will use the Yeti for live streaming. But if we are shooting- I wonder if I can- let me see if I can pop this off so you guys can see it. This is a zoom eight six. It's hanging right over my head, just out of sight on a boom pole. And so it's dangling down and pointing at me. And so normally this is what we record our sound on now. But this bad boy is was something we upgraded to later. I think this is a good place to start. Or you can go even cheaper. The zoom H1 is like the tiny baby brother to this. And for a while we would just put it right on the table, right in front of us. And it doesn't have this on it. So, you can't see it and you can connect a cheap $20 Lav mic to it and plug it in right here or even cheaper than that record. Do the same thing but record on your phone.\
\
[00:19:19.620] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:20.010] - Tasha\
The annoying thing about recording on your phone is that you then got to get the recording over to your computer and it's not- so you've got to plug it into your computer. I just find it a little bit extra hassle, but it's cheaper than buying an entirely new piece of equipment.\
\
[00:19:33.840] - Liz\
True.\
\
[00:19:34.830] - Tasha\
Having said that, I truly believe in investing in your business and investing in the equipment that you need to show up pro, because if you invest in your business, your business will grow and thrive. So we have always invested. We just didn't start with, you know, higher end things. We started out with things that cost maybe $50, $100 and slowly built up our gear over time.\
\
[00:20:02.410] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay, so we've covered storage and sound and recording equipment, I feel like we should just go and touch on lights.\
\
[00:20:13.090] - Tasha\
Lights, lighting. Okay, please burn your ring lights. Burn them. Okay, like just toss them out because here's the thing; I think that people thought that ring lights were the Holy Grail because beauty bloggers use ring lights. That's where they came from because beauty bloggers were super close to the camera. They wanted all this like an evenly lit face. Why? Because they contour their face, so it doesn't matter if their faces flat from light, because they add it back in with makeup. But for regular people, a more flattering look is to have your light coming from like two different areas.\
\
[00:20:50.680] - Tasha\
So I have a soft box here and a soft box here. And I'm in a room that has zero light. Basically, I've got two windows that might as well be walls because there's so little light that comes in. But in my office it is a bright room. So, as long as the sun is out, there's plenty of light there. And so with a good camera, which IPhones now have- cameras are plenty good. You don't need any extra light.\
\
[00:21:17.710] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:21:18.550] - Tasha\
So if you have some great natural light, if you can sit in front of a window then you may not need any extra light. But if you have a dark room like I do, that's the only option, then you're going to need two soft boxes on either side of you. And again, these aren't expensive either. You can get two for like one hundred bucks.\
\
[00:21:35.470] - Liz\
Yeah, I think I got mine for 160. I'm using right now because I loan them out to my sister. But I have a window right here and I was like if I turned it would be better, but that just didn't work out with the way the room was. So I keep the blinds closed behind me because otherwise it wouldn't be much.\
\
[00:21:50.560] - Tasha\
That's what I had going on too. And so we spent a day and rearranged our entire office so that I could have one window in front of me and one to the side. And so now I don't absolutely- I don't have to have any light in that room except for if I'm trying to do something after the sun has set, which can happen in winter when the sun is gone at five o'clock.\
\
[00:22:11.050] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:22:11.200] - Tasha\
And so I do actually have a ring light in the office, but it's way off to the side and it's tilted up. And so then I can crank that sucker up and the light will bounce off the ceiling and hit my face. So, never even coming directly to me.\
\
[00:22:24.400] - Liz\
Yeah, I actually I do have a light going on right now, but it's like the lowest setting and it's a ways away. Yeah.\
\
[00:22:30.730] - Tasha\
As long as a ring light is fine, it just shouldn't be right in front of your face. You can put it off to the side if you already have one, don't get rid of it. It'll work just fine. And I actually like that they can adjust because these lights here that I have, they don't adjust quite as much. There's like two levels, basically. And that's it.\
\
[00:22:49.570] - Liz\
Yeah. No, I agree. Yeah. So okay. Any other any final words for people who are willing to do YouTube in conjunction with their blog or get started on YouTube- a real strategy?\
\
[00:23:00.310] - Tasha\
Well, yeah, I would say just get started. So I've got to just get started because too many people per use, right? Business owners, we overthink everything and we think that it has to be perfect in order for us to get started. But that's absolutely not the case. You look at our old videos. In fact, my very first video was a hair video and it is yellow as all get out with just yellow. The color is awful. The angles are awful. The sound is awful. It was a T five I, I wasn't trying to start a YouTube channel. I was just trying to make a YouTube video and put it up because I thought that it would be helpful to other people. And even when I was thinking, Okay, well now I'm going to do this YouTube channel thing, my content didn't look anything like what it looks like now, you know, and my current content, which is plenty to get me to 200,000 subscribers, 17 million views, biggest working with huge brand partners. It's still not that fancy. I don't have a fancy editor adding in all sorts of bells and whistles either. It's still very basic and that's fine because it's very effective.\
\
[00:24:15.590] - Tasha\
So, the second tip that I have, which I will say is I actually feel like it's the most important thing. So, when you start making content, be purposeful about it and include a specific call to action in every single video that will drive people to do something that you want them to do. Right. Because people don't take action unless you specifically tell them to. They'll just say, "Okay, that was great. Now I'll move on to the next video", if you don't tell them what to do. And the thing with YouTube videos, unlike blog posts, you can never change them. Once they are out there, they're out there. And maybe you can change, say, the description box. But people may not read the description box if you don't even tell them there's something in the description box that you want them to see.\
\
[00:25:02.480] - Tasha\
So when you're making your videos, just think about, well, ultimately, what do I what's the purpose of this video? What do I want it to do for my my business, for my blog? What action do I want people to take to bring them closer into the fold of my business and my company and my brand? And make sure that you're putting that stuff in there from the very beginning because you're going to be upset if you start making the YouTube videos. And six months from now, your very first video takes off and it doesn't have a single call to action in it. So it serves no purpose whatsoever.\
\
[00:25:38.120] - Liz\
Yeah, and one call to action, though, ideally.\
\
[00:25:40.520] - Tasha\
Right.\
\
[00:25:40.790] - Liz\
If you give them multiple, they're going to choose none of them. I think last year we learned during one the YouTube sessions that you can actually have like a default description. And so I started using that and have CTA in there so, I never forget to type it or talking about it. So, it's another little quick tip.\
\
[00:25:58.610] - Tasha\
Yes.\
\
[00:25:58.970] - Liz\
Okay, awesome. Thank you. I think this is super helpful, especially for people that may be feeling a little intimidated at doing video. Done is better than perfect. Give it a go, be consistent. How long would you say you need to be consistent before you should kind of, you know, maybe decide that's not going to work out for you?\
\
[00:26:15.800] - Tasha\
So I don't believe that there's any such thing as it not working out for you. Right. With anything in business. It's like I think that people go to a thing they hear like, oh, videos. The next thing, because I'm sure, like, YouTube is very hot right now. I'm getting this vibe because, like, we have some opt-ins related to YouTube and those are getting more and more traction, even though I'm not doing anything with them because our YouTube course is not currently available for sale.\
\
[00:26:44.420] - Tasha\
And so I think that we all have this tendency in online marketing to hop on the next fancy thing. And so when people don't immediately gain traction on YouTube, they think, "Oh, well, this is never going to work." But a better question to ask is, what can I do here? Like where? Like troubleshoot, what's not working and why isn't it working? I think the only time that you should really consider scratching your YouTube channel is if you gave it a good go, like maybe six months to a year and you're still like and let's say six months and you're like, I hate video. Like I absolutely hate it, you know-\
\
[00:27:25.400] - Liz\
You don't like anything about it.\
\
[00:27:25.510] - Tasha\
There's nothing that I enjoy about this. And it is my strong preference to never be direct to camera. Even still, I would kind of push you a little bit and say we are that is where things are going. So, if you want an online business, then I strongly encourage you to go take a speaking class. Right? Like go to Toastmasters, go take a course on how to become a better speaker, on how to get comfortable in front of the camera so that you can do this. Because I do believe that having. The video will really help you grow your business and grow your website, because think about if someone pops on to a website, it's just words and sometimes it can be really hard for your personality to shine through in a single blog post, especially if it's a very- it's like a listicle, very utilitarian type of blog post. Whereas in a video they can't help but get to know your personality at least somewhat because they see your gestures and hear your voice.\
\
[00:28:28.690] - Liz\
Also puns going on.\
\
[00:28:28.690] - Tasha\
Exactly. And so it's it's how you start to build a relationship with someone. Like there is a reason why Match.com has added video chat to their process of connecting people, because video really does help build relationships and help you see if your- it helped them see if you're a good fit to help guide them on whatever it is that you want to help them with. So, I just see it see it as a way of serving your customer on a deeper level, serving your audience on a deeper level, so that they can feel that connection with you and want to come back to you over and over and over again.\
\
[00:29:05.590] - Liz\
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so I think we're about out of time. They should definitely check out your site. Is there anything particular they should go check out? I think we have a link, but is anything particular you want to tell them they should go check out?\
\
[00:29:17.570] - Tasha\
Yes. So we do have a five day QuickStart course to get them started with YouTube, giving them some great tips on how to build a YouTube channel from the ground up the right way so they can grab that over at one big happy life dot com forward slash and YouTube tips.\
\
[00:29:35.740] - Liz\
Yeah, we'll make sure the link is on this page. Definitely go check it out. Obviously, Tasha knows what she's talking about. This is just scratching the surface of her knowledge. Tasha, thank you so much. I appreciate you taking the time.\
\
[00:29:48.370] - Tasha\
Oh Liz this was so much fun. Thanks for having me.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:03.650] - Thei Zervaki\
Hello, I'm Thei Zervaki, and today I'm going to talk to you about strategic social media makeover using artificial intelligence and human design. I'm Thei, and I'm a linguist, translator, and interpreter based in Seattle. I also have a full blog. That's why I'm here with you at that summit. I use also different tools like human design and astrology to create content easily, the easy way, let's say, whenever I can. Okay, let's go. The plan for the day. I'm going to talk to you about social media today and why we do care for social media, or maybe we don't. What is human design and how we can use it for your content creation? And the use of AI as a tool to create, engage with social media content fast. Okay, let's talk a little bit about social media and why we love to hate social media. I'm sure that most of you know all the statements I'm going to read that I collected throughout the last few months. We don't have the luxury not to be on social media. We need to get off social media sites because they're toxic. You have to be visible, let people know what you're up to and be discovered on social media.\
\
[00:01:29.020] - Thei Zervaki\
Social media is neither negative It's the positive, it's the energy who attached to it. Social media can be around. We don't decide, the algorithm does. Finally, you never know who is going to see you on social media and what doors will open for you. I don't know if you agree or disagree with those, but in any case, all the statements are legit. The first and the second that they contradict each other, we don't have the likes to not to be. The other one says, Oh, you have to get off social media because they're so bad. You have to be visible, you are discovered. It's all about being found online. A lot of people talk about randomness of social media. It's the algorithm that decides. I like the blue. The fourth on this page, social media is neither negative or positive. It's the energy we're attached to it, and this is what I believe about social media. Now, am I consistent in social media? No, I'm not. For the same reasons as everybody else. It's a lot of work. It's not paid work, really. You never know what is going to happen with that work. Some of that type disappears immediately.\
\
[00:02:35.370] - Thei Zervaki\
The next couple of hours, other posts, they stay there for a longer time. I'm myself a little bit confused. That's why I try to employ tools that make the process of social media creation easier. Now, because I told you I have a food blog, I don't like Instagram because mainly Instagram is very visual and there's a lot of competition. All the food bloggers are there. You have to compete with 5 million other food bloggers together with professional chefs, mystery chefs, and restaurant owners, coffee shop owners, and bakers. I don't actually like it. I am very consistent on Pinterest, which technically is not a social media platform. It's more like a search engine. I see the evolution and the progress, even if it's slow. It is slow progress, but I can see it. The more I post on a Pinterest, the more traffic I get, the more impressions I get, the more saved I get, the more clicks I get. I see something's moving on on Pinterest and I like it. Does it take time to create all those pins? Does It does. But I found a system, I batch it, I use pamphlets, so I make it easier for me.\
\
[00:03:53.170] - Thei Zervaki\
But again, Pinterest is not social media. It's a search engine. It's slightly different. Now, there is no a small size fits all approach for social media. That's why also different. Some people, they use all the social media platforms. They're everywhere. Instagram, threads, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest even. Others, they pick one. I'm only on LinkedIn. I told you, I'm a translator and interpreter. I use LinkedIn for that part of my business and try to be consistent and be on LinkedIn one or twice a week. It's actually quite helpful. People see me, I get job offers or project offers rather. It works for me. But again, am I consistent all the time? No, I'm not. Do I show up every day? No, I don't. That will continue being. This is The main thing I want you to think a little bit about. What you need to find out is what you're going to be known for in life in general, but in social media, specifically for this presentation. Because if you don't know what you're going to be known for, you can't really create any content on social media. You have to, Okay, why am I going to be discovered?\
\
[00:05:04.580] - Thei Zervaki\
Why I want people to find me? Or what for I want people to find me on social media? Am I the top-notch food blogger that I make amazing, three layer cakes, and this is how I want to be known on social media? Or I am the top-notch travel blogger that I create content about South American countries that people travel, and I want to be known for that expertise. You have to find what you're going to be known for social media, what is your expertise. Then based on that, you can decide what type of content you're going to create and what are your content pillars. Think of content pillars like your categories. Go to your blog and find your top three categories and then decide if this is what you're going to post about on Instagram, Facebook, and any other platform you do post. Okay, now let's talk a little bit about human design. Human design is the pseudoscience, as people think. It's a spiritual, intuitive tool that you may or may not like. It's not science. I'm very clear about that. It's more like a modern, a complex system grounded in ancient tools and practices, including the Astrology, the tractor system, the Chinese Ai Qi and Kabala.\
\
[00:06:18.410] - Thei Zervaki\
At the center of human design, there are four energy types that provide insights into our individuality and how we interact with the world. You can see human design as a roadmap to discover who you are, your precise uniqueness, strengths, gifts, and traits. You can use human design every day for business, marketing, content creation, communications, relationships, and so on. Human design has been developed by Alan Robert Krakower, following an alleged mystical experience in Spain in the late '80s. He then published the book The Human Design System under the pseudonym Ra\'fal H\'fa in 1992, and he's known as Ra in the world of human design. Ra died in 2011, so he's not alive right now, but he left a whole huge intellectual property estate that most of it is hosted on Jovian Archive, with a lot of information, programs, courses, books, et cetera. It's not the only one that is available. There are a lot of online human design schools and systems and books, and there are a lot of human design consultants, and you can find anything you want online. One thing to know, human design is very complex. It's not something that you can learn very easily, and it takes a lot of years of practice and studying and all those things.\
\
[00:07:40.300] - Thei Zervaki\
I actually find out human design in the late '90s, but I haven't done much about that since then. I rediscovered in about 2015, and I slowly started to study basically everything I could find online for free because I have to say the human design classes are really expensive. A lot of free information online articles, books, YouTube, videos, and so on. Then after a while, I started taking classes and invest a little bit more on human design. But I also study astronomy for a very long time, since I was a teenager, with a lot of many famous astrologists in different astrologists schools. I'm with that type of area and of expertise, let's say. Although I never turned that into a full-time career, I always use it as a side, tool project, and I work with the clients for readings and applications for that. Let's move on now and find out how you're going to create your chart. You need to do your chart for free. Your human design chart, the basic one, is free. Now, if you want to have a most sophisticated, complicated chart, you have to pay. But the free one is fine for this presentation, and you don't need more than that, really.\
\
[00:08:53.970] - Thei Zervaki\
I did the two charts I created for this presentation. There are two avatars I'm going to use. I created the chart of Joven Archive website, which looks like that. You need to know, as I said, the date of birth, the time of birth, and the location of birth. In this case, our first avatar is Jennifer, also known as Jan, born in July 15, 1979, at 9:15 in the morning in Chicago. When you see that chart, you see different things here. You see the body in the middle, which just looks like a chakra system, which it is. You see numbers right and left, red and black, arrows, and information on top about type, definition strategy, profile, inner authority, not self-theme, and incarnation cross. Now, for this presentation, we only care for the type and the strategy. Jennifer was a projector, and the strategy was to wait for the invitation. The type is your energetic field looks like and what it does, and the strategy is how to use it energy for a life-release resistance. There are four different types in human design. Basically, all of us, the humans, are divided into four types. Each one does different things.\
\
[00:10:10.190] - Thei Zervaki\
The whole idea is to embrace your type and embody your type. If you do, life is a little bit easier. The generators are manifesting generators, two types under one, basically, they both have the same strategy to respond. They make 70% of the population. You're most likely to be a generator, manifesting generator. The strategy is to respond, which means to respond to what people want and provide solutions. The generators or manifesting generators are actually the people here who do things. The doers, the builders, the producers, the creators that have a lot of energy and they're super productive. Then, yes, they respond to what people want and they provide solutions. Famous generators, Oprah Winfrey, Jlo, Madonna, the creative types that work all all the time. Oprah once, I think she was given an interview and she was talking about her life, saying, I have a day job, I have a morning job, an afternoon job, an evening job. She keeps working all the time. The manifesting generators are slightly different. On top of that, they're also super efficient and they're multitaskers. Everybody needs a manifesting generator in their team because those people are really good to juggle different projects.\
\
[00:11:27.310] - Thei Zervaki\
They're multitasking and they have an incredible energy. Think of Elon Musk, from Teslas to the space to, I don't know what else he's doing, AI now, social media platforms. Tony Robbins, how many workshops he has done so far in his life? How many books he wrote the last 30 years, he's doing what he does. You can do it. You can do it. Steven King, how many books he wrote, Steven King? I don't even know. I lost track. Let's move to the next type, which is the projectors. 21% of the population are projectors, and the strategy is to wait for the invitation. I will explain what that means. Projectors are here to guide us. They're the experts, the guides, the advisors. They make amazing coaches and consultants and helpers, and they are natural teachers too. They have the amazing ability to see things clearly and to show us a new way of success. Now, wait for the invitation does not mean that you sit and wait. That truly means is to go out and about and be seen in the world. And then the world, when they see you, they invite you in their life. Famous projector, Barack Obama.\
\
[00:12:41.560] - Thei Zervaki\
Do you think Barack Obama would ever be elected as a president if he was just waiting for the invitation? No. He was out and about, and he was seen, and he was talking and engaging with people. And one day, he was nominated for the presidency, and the rest is history. Princess Diana, same thing. She She wasn't waiting to be invited to the royal family. She claimed the invitation on her own, on her own right. Next group, manifestors, 8% of the population. Those are the people who are the trailblazers and that they like to get things started. They're here to inform and to initiate that strategy. They initiate things, but they are not necessarily into the all doing things. They just bring new ideas into life. They like to innovate. They are the visionaries, the trend setters, and they thrive when they do things on their own terms in their own way. As I said, they don't necessarily do the whole thing. They inform, they initiate, they set the trend, They send you off with all of ideas and innovations and whatever else they're going to initiate, but they don't necessarily finish everything off. Manifestors also work in cycles.\
\
[00:13:58.650] - Thei Zervaki\
Like Adele is a A good example of that. They work and they perform and they do what they do, but then they disappear for some time. Like Adele, she creates an amazing album, she was on tour for six months, and then you don't see her for the next 12 months. It's not that they do nothing in that time. It's just they don't want to be seen. They work behind the scenes, they rest, they recharge, and they work on the next project, right? But they're not out and about. And the final group, the reflectors, 1% of the population strategy to wait for the Lunas cycle. Because people are the natural empaths, they take in and mirror the energy that is surrounded around them, and they can offer a powerful objective assessment of any environment they're in. So the Lunas cycle, I don't know if you know about this, but the lunar cycle takes 28 days for a lunar cycle, basically. From the new moon to the full moon is 14 days, and from the next full moon to the next new moon, another 14. So they follow that. Famous reflector, Sandra Bullock, Rosalind Carter. I never met a reflector, as far as I know.\
\
[00:15:09.840] - Thei Zervaki\
Probably I met, but I didn't know that I met. But 1% of the population is really small compared to the 70%, but still, there are quite a few reflectors out there. I haven't many one as far as I know, though. If you're a reflector, let us know who you are, how is to be a reflector these days and how you function. Okay, now let's move to the next. The first practical example I'm going to share with you, I'm going to do two. I'm going to try to rush because I don't have too much time for this presentation. Jennifer sees a projector and the strategy is to just wait for the invitation. Let's create a prompt by picking our favorite AI tool in this case. You pick your favorite AI tool. I'm not going to tell you which one. I used ChatGPT, the free version of ChatGPT for this one because I want everybody to try the same. If you want to, you can use Gemini, you can use Claude, you can use Perplexity. There are so many these days. Then once you pick your favorite AI tool, you assign it a role. In this case, I said to the tool when I prompt it, You are my social media content creator now.\
\
[00:16:19.780] - Thei Zervaki\
Then I create the instructions, which is actually known as prompts. This is a long one. I think this is probably about 160 words or something like that, even more maybe. Jennifer is a beauty blogger, and this is how I describe the blog. My blog is a beauty blog that provides content on minimalistic beauty and skincare for Gen X women, 46 to 65 years old in the US. That includes product reviews, product launches, and trends in this beauty category. My target audience are Gen X women who want to maximize their results by reducing cost and time. This is a very good description of what the blog does and what the target audiences of the blog are. Jennifer is very clear about this, right? Minimalistic beauties, skincare for Gen X women, what the blog reviews and talks about and what the target audience are and what they want. The other code or prompt I included, and you don't have to do that if you don't want to, I said that the respond will engage voice as the social media content creator on a medium-sized blog, beauty blog. Give me details and examples and feel free to share your opinion.\
\
[00:17:36.520] - Thei Zervaki\
Use tables and graphs when delivering content strategies. You don't have to call that if you don't want to, or you can create your own. You can ask AI to give you whatever you want from AI. Now the green highlight here is exactly what we want the human design and AI to do together with our content pillars. Develop a content creation workflow for Instagram that aligns with my human design time of a projector in my strategy to go ahead for the invitation. For this one, the social media atlant is IG, it's Instagram. My content pillars on educational post readers, a day in the life of a skincare beauty creator, and cutting-edge skincare tools. Three content pillars for this case, right? Educational post, a day in the life of a beauty creator, and cutting-edge skincare tools. Build a table with seven days of content ideas, focusing on Instagram reels, carousels, and stories as the primary types of content. That's actually a good prompt to use. If you don't want seven days, you can five days or 14 days or three days, whatever you want. Seven is a good chunk of content that you're going to get. You can split in different days if you don't want to post every day for seven days.\
\
[00:18:52.580] - Thei Zervaki\
That's the general information that they gave me, ChatGPT. For Jen's Instagram strategy, focusing on Minimalistic Beauty and Skincare for Gen X women, it's crucial to present content that resonates with your audience's desires for effective yet simple solutions. As a projector, Jen's content should position her as a guide who introduces insightful tips and trends, invite your audience to learn and engage on a deeper level. You see, we talked that projectors make good guides, and ChatGPT got it immediately. Here is a detailed seven-day Instagram content plan that leverages the strengths of a projector in human design, focus on educational posts, the day in the life, and the latest skincare tools. Now, it's a lot of information here, people, so I have to rush and be fast. For day one, the content type is real, and the topic is quick morning skincare from busy Gen Xers So you create like a reel video. Showcase a simple quick morning skincare routine using minimal products that deliver results. Use before and after skin visuals. Cta, the call to action, top save if you're trying this tomorrow. I like that. Good idea. Day 2, Carousel. Top three skincare tools for women over 40.\
\
[00:20:05.220] - Thei Zervaki\
Very good. Introduce tools like LED masks, microcaron devices, and Sony cleansers, detailing their benefits for my true skin. Each slide can focus on one tool, CTA. Which tool are you curious about? Comment below. Very good. You do what you do and you have all the CTAs and the comment below call to action. Very, very good. So day three, story and poll together. Choose our next review. That's very good for a story. Review two or three products and use a poll to let followers decide which one Jen should review next. This builds engagement by involving them in content creation. It's call to action. What for the product you're going to ask to explore next. That's a very good idea. That gives you some clues about your audiences about what products they like. Day 4, make it real. Decode Serum ingredients. That's advanced. Explain common ingredients in serums ideal for Gen X skin, like hyaluronic acid and retinol. Use clear, concise language and visual. Cta, DM us your favorite serum and why? Amazing. Day 5, carousel. Five minimalistic beauty tips for maximum impact. Share tips and simplify beauty routines while maximizing skin health and esthetics such as multi-purpose product or overnight treatments.\
\
[00:21:23.710] - Thei Zervaki\
Call to action. Which tip are you going to try? Let us know. I find that the five, maybe it's too much information. Maybe you should do a three instead of five. Maybe five is a lot. If you have time, you can do five, but you can do three and another three next week, for example. Day six, the real evening routine for optimal skin repair, another real. You demonstrate an effective night routine focused on rejuvenation and hydration featuring 2-3 key products. Cta, save this rule for your night routine. Very good idea. Two to three products is fine. And the day seven, stories a question, ask me anything skincare edition. In this case, the suggestion is to host an ask me anything, where Jen will answer a follow-up questions about skincare challenges, products, and techniques. This position Jen as an approachable expert and builds community. Engagement strategy, use questions, stickers to collect questions throughout the week in your stories, probably, and then answer them in a story series. Okay, I have to sip a little bit of coffee. In this case, if you find that you like some more than others, you have a choice. What you can do, you can pick, let's say, the three ones that you like the best.\
\
[00:22:46.340] - Thei Zervaki\
Let's say that you like one reel, one story, poll and one carousel, and you can put it back on your AI tool stating that those three are my favorite suggestions based on my prompt. Create more of the same suggestions. In other words, create more carousels, more story and poll and more reels. Or you can formulate it according to your own language on what you want AI to create for you because maybe you don't like the ask me anything. Maybe you don't like to have too many carousels with five slides each time because it's too much for you. Then also seven days, you don't have to do seven days. I may be already told you, but you can do five, you can do three. Some people, they like to batch their content creation for social media, and they ask 14 days or 21 days. You get everything in one goal. You sit one day in front of your computer, get your AI, get your human design stuff. You put in there, and you ask 21 days for content creation. Then you take them and you put them the days that you like, not necessarily one day after the other.\
\
[00:23:51.290] - Thei Zervaki\
Some people are very good. They show up every day. Others, not so much. You don't have to show up every day if you don't want to, but you have to show consistency. I said that to myself, too. Okay, that's Jennifer, the beauty skincare blogger. Now, we're going to do another one, and this time of John. John was created. He was born in December 21st, 1989, at 9:15 PM in Miami, and he's a manifesting generator and his strategy is to respond. So John is a travel blogger, and his favorite social media platform is LinkedIn because his blog is a travel blog that provides content on destinations in the Caribbean Islands, targeting professional men and women, 45 to 65 in the US. That includes specific itineraries in the Caribbean, obviously, high-end resort and hotel reviews, as well as exclusive shopping ideas. My target audiences are women and men who have disposable income and want to indulge while traveling in the Caribbean. His blog is more like a high-end blog targeting a little bit older people, not Gen Z, not millennials, 45 to 65 Gen X and boomers, younger boomers. This is what he wants to focus on.\
\
[00:25:10.560] - Thei Zervaki\
The green highlight says, Develop a content creation workflow on LinkedIn. Com that aligns with my human design type of manifesting generator and my strategy to respond. My content pillars a high-end resort and hotels in the Caribbean, a day in the life of the Caribbean traveler, and the luxurious shopping in the Caribbean Islands. Build a table with seven days of content ideas, focus on LinkedIn text posts, video posts, audience posts, and articles as the primary types of content. In this case, LinkedIn, I don't know if you use LinkedIn, some of you, or not, allows text post, video post, image post, articles post. You can do a whole newsletter on LinkedIn if you want to, although I don't think newsletter is actually social media. You could do, what do you call them? One-liners. You just post one line, like a statement, and you leave it there, and people come and engage with you later on. We're going to see what ChatGPT created. I was a little bit disappointed with ChatGPT for this one, to be honest, because it didn't really explain if took into consideration. He said, Yeah, it's very simple. This is the content creation for John based on his human design type, but he didn't really precise that he is a manifesting generator and strategy is to respond.\
\
[00:26:34.330] - Thei Zervaki\
Okay, it's also a very good content plan for seven days, but it's too much information, in my opinion. I think John can use it in two weeks, really. For example, the first one is an article, and it's a long article of five luxury resorts in the Caribbean for 2024, the top five. Kick off with the detail article reviewing the best luxury resorts, including amenities, unique features, and why they stand out. That's actually a lot of work. The call to action is, which of these have you visited or planned to visit? Share your experiences. You don't have to do such a long article. You can do, let's say, the top one luxury resort according to the trends. We have one top-notch, a luxurious resort in the Caribbean, or maybe the top three. Five is too much information. You can do one every week if you want to. You can do two every week. It's a good idea, though, to review a luxury resort for your travel blog on social media because that gives a good information to your audiences. Day two, video post a day at the Hyatt Caribbean resort. Okay, that's really cool. You can do a video.\
\
[00:27:44.090] - Thei Zervaki\
You take your viewers through a day, the top-tier Caribbean Resort from breakfast buffet to spa treatment. Obviously, you have to ask for permission for that. I'm sure that the result wouldn't mind, but just in case, call to action, would you spend on a day like this? Let us know in the comment. Okay, Text post on day 3, Insider tips for luxury travel in the Caribbean. That's actually the video. All the Insider tips really do very well. Not only on social media, they do well everywhere. Really blog post, now Substack, even. Provide valuable tips for navigating the high-end aspects of Caribbean travel, such as the best time to visit for exclusivity, travel hub, etc. Cta, do you have any travel tips to add? Comment below. Now, we do a poll on number 4, Favorite Caribbean Island for Luxury Shopping. You ask your followers to vote for the Favorite Caribbean Island for Luxury Shopping. Then, as an engagement strategy, you follow up with a post discussing the most popular choice and what makes it special. Okay, that's actually a very good idea. Day 5, a video post, exclusive shopping in the Caribbean, what to buy and where.\
\
[00:28:50.360] - Thei Zervaki\
Basically, you do a video exploring a luxury shopping district in the Caribbean, highlighting local products, art, and jewelry. I think for this one, you should focus maybe on one or two. Shops on one specific island. You can go everywhere. I mean, the video will be long. Then, has CTA ever bought something special from the Caribbean? Sure, you find. Let's go, for example, let's say you're in Barbados and you do a video on a specific jewelry shop on Barbados. That's very specific. Day 6, text, post an image, spot-flying Caribbean culinary delights at five-star resorts. So your formation on gourmet dining options on a high-end Caribbean resorts, including photos, dishes and chef insights. CTA, which of these dishes would you like to try on your rest of vacation? Comment your choice. Again, it's long. You can pick one gourmet restaurant, high-end restaurant, all of them. The final day, they do an article Planning your Luxury Caribbean getaway, comprehensive guide. This is actually a guide. It's a long-form article that serves as a guide to plan on a luxury vacation in the Caribbean. I think this one, it should be more like an article about About Planning that is probably short.\
\
[00:30:03.740] - Thei Zervaki\
Then you can try to upsell your guide. So your guide, it should be the main product, not the freebie. Then you have a CTA, what's your top tip for to get away, grab your guide, grab my guide, and you direct them to your shop, Shopify shop, your website, whatever. This is a lot of information. The other thing I forget to tell you is that LinkedIn allows you to Instead of writing an article, you can share an article of a top-notch, in this case, travel magazine like Travel and Leisure, National Geographic, something like that. That's it, people. This is what I had to share with you. I hope you enjoyed this presentation and you got some ideas about what is human design and how you can use it for your content creation on social media. Obviously, I only take the type and the strategy. So call to action for my part, your homework otherwise known, pick your favorite social media platform, whatever it is, create your human design chart and focus on type and strategy for this part because it's only the beginning. I include my profile lines when I do that. This gives you way for more detailed information for your content creation and social media.\
\
[00:31:23.990] - Thei Zervaki\
Then pick your favorite AI tool and develop your prompts. Assign your AI tool and and develop your prompts as I highlighted here in yellow and green. Then you can download my resource guide somewhere here on that page. It's a simple resource guide with a curated list of articles, books, and websites about human design and social media, and some other information. Yet, I hope you find helpful. And that's all I had to tell you today. You got to find me, find me a hello at ninthhouseastrology.Com and at Threads, theiswords, which is the same name as Instagram, but I'm not really active on Instagram. So, threads@theiswords. Thank you so much. See you soon on the internet and somewhere on Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads. Have fun. Bye-bye.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 3\
All right, guys. I am excited for this next session with Trina Little. Thank you, Trina. Welcome. Hi.\
\
[00:00:05.680] - Speaker 2\
Thank you for having me.\
\
[00:00:07.720] - Speaker 3\
Yes, because I'm like, I need to know how to do this because you're going to talk about creating videos, which I feel takes... I was really working on doing videos with each blog post last year, and I stopped doing that because it just felt like it was slowing me down. And so I'm really excited for your session because you're going to be teaching us about how to create, what did you say, a month's worth of videos in...\
\
[00:00:31.220] - Speaker 1\
One day. In one day.\
\
[00:00:32.890] - Speaker 3\
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely need to know that. All right. So can you tell us a little bit about your background, what got you into this, and then the highlights of what we're going to cover?\
\
[00:00:43.940] - Speaker 2\
Yeah. So I come from a business background. I have a master's in business. And prior to 2015, I just thought YouTube was a place for cat videos. I actually was using YouTube on my own, uploading videos of my friends and I when we traveled. And so it was an easy way to share videos to them because we lived across the country. When I got pregnant the first time, I went down the YouTube hole because I had no idea what was happening to me. And so I was finding other people that were also pregnant for the first time sharing their journey. And I realized when my business mind clicked with this YouTube piece, how it all worked together. And I saw how people were creating communities and really creating this know, like and trust. In fact, I used one of the channels that I was watching in 2015 as the place that I went to get all of my baby registry stuff. And then just some person who I had watched for weeks and trusted what she told me to get in my register. So I really started to see how this all fits in a marketing strategy and how it could really change the game in business, even back in 2015.\
\
[00:01:54.990] - Speaker 2\
And so I started playing with YouTube. I started trying to figure it out, see how it worked. And as I started creating videos, I started getting asked questions like, how did you add a thumbnail? How did you know what's the title it? How did you do this? And so I saw the opportunity, and I took the jump and started teaching people how to do YouTube and also managing YouTube channels. And so it's just snowballed from there.\
\
[00:02:19.550] - Speaker 3\
Okay, that's awesome. So what are the high points or the steps we're going to learn today so that you can create a month worth of videos in a day?\
\
[00:02:27.800] - Speaker 1\
Yeah.\
\
[00:02:28.340] - Speaker 2\
So I talk a lot about YouTube because that's my sweet spot because I use YouTube as the hub of my content. But today I'm going to talk to you how to get started with that video that you could put on YouTube. And so it's going to be three steps to super simple video creation that I use to grow my YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, plus my email list and attract more clients by using this three step. I'm also how to create video content that looks professional because I know a lot of the times we don't want to stuff out there that doesn't look super professional. So I'm going to get you covered there. And then most importantly, how you can start implementing today all of the stuff that I just talked about and do it in your business, just like we said, eight hours a month.\
\
[00:03:13.860] - Speaker 3\
Wow. Okay. I am excited. Let's get going. All right, let's go.\
\
[00:03:19.540] - Speaker 1\
All right, so let's get started. I have my notes right over here alongside of me. So if you see me picking over there, I'm just making sure I'm getting you all the content that I have jam-packed into this presentation for you because I don't want you to miss anything. I just want to get to know you here a little bit, start chatting in the chat box. I would love to hear from you to know if anyone here has ever felt like they're spinning their wheels when it comes to creating content, blog posts, Instagram posts, Pinterest pins, all the stuff that goes into blogging. Do you ever feel like you're just going through the motions, but nothing ever seems to move needle forward. No matter what you do, you can't get more traffic to that blog, and it's just like, what the heck should you do next? Today, I want to talk about when I first started my business real quick, I was juggling it all. I had every single hour of my day down. To say I had calendar blocking down to a T is an understatement. Every single minute of my day was blocked with something that had to be done.\
\
[00:04:30.120] - Speaker 1\
I only had so many childcare hours, so I really needed to maximize those hours to get everything done on my to-do list because it was always so massive to do. The only problem with having every single thing down in my schedule and mapped out was I didn't map in my calendar time for a little boy to have a 104-degree fever. I didn't have time for when the internet went out for four hours. I didn't block in time into my schedule when I was struggling with postpartum depression and creating content just wasn't going to happen because I just couldn't get out of bed that day. Maybe you're dealing with depression, maybe you're dealing with juggling blogging and childcare. But the thing is, we are not thinking about our time effectively. This is This is exactly when I realized when this guy woke up that morning and had that fever and he couldn't go to childcare, and I thought, Crap, I already have these things that need to get done today. What's going to happen next? This is exactly when I realized it It's time to maximize my content, the content that I was already creating, and create a system so I wasn't constantly worried about running on the content creation hamster wheel, and I had space in my schedule, in my daily life, to take care of my family and myself when I needed to.\
\
[00:06:04.940] - Speaker 1\
I want to take just a second here for you to calculate how many hours in a week are you actually spending creating content. I'm talking blogging, maybe this Pinterest graphics for that blog. Maybe you have a newsletter, maybe you don't. Maybe you're posting about your blog on Instagram. All of that content you're creating, I want you to drop that in the chat box. How many hours a week week do you think you are spending creating content? I'm going to take a minute, let you really think about that because it's a huge question, right? Is it 5 hours? Maybe 10? Maybe you have no idea because you're doing it all the time. But the more important question we need to ask is, is creating this content actually working for you? Moving that needle forward, getting you more traffic to your blog? I want to talk about this theory of time. This is Parkinson's law that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Maybe it's taking you 5, 10, 15 hours to create your content because you aren't putting parameters on your time. You're like me. You're thinking, it's going to take me five hours to write this blog post.\
\
[00:07:20.000] - Speaker 1\
I'm blocking five hours. It's going to take me three hours to plan out my Instagram content, so I'm blocking three hours. Like I said, I was blogging all of my hours for content creation, and my days quickly became jam-packed. I felt like I could never get everything done because every single minute was scheduled. So if any hiccup showed up, I was stuck, right? Here's the thing. Most of us started blogging, or maybe we even started a business around our blog to set our own hours, to work when we wanted to, to spend more time with our family, not work all the time, not let our blog and our content creation take over our life. That's exactly where I was at. When something came up, I had no flexibility. I had no time in my schedule to live. I want to know, real life right here, we're getting raw and real. Is your content controlling your life right now? Is it controlling your life because that's what they, the experts, say? They say the more content, the better. If you aren't cranking out content every single day, you're behind and you're going to fail. That's what they're saying.\
\
[00:08:27.790] - Speaker 1\
Maybe this is what your day looks right now. Your life is consumed with that content creation. It's all you ever do. And that's not how you envision life when you started this blog. Here's what no one tells you. I'm going to tell you a little secret that nobody tells you. Make less content, but do it better. In 2018, when my son had that fever, so back to that first slide, in my entire calendar was thrown out of whack for that week, I I had to make a change. I couldn't keep living this way because it just wasn't sustainable. I started creating less content in 2019, and I set parameters that I was not working on Fridays. Tuesdays and Thursdays were my big work days because Wednesday and Monday, I had preschool pickup and drop off, and I wanted to be there for preschool pickup and drop off. So Monday and Wednesday were only half days for me. And during that time in not only did my business, my revenue in my business, double and I hit that six-figure business revenue club, I did less content creation. I created less. So if you're ready to see how, go ahead and tell me you're ready in the chat because we are going to dig right on in.\
\
[00:09:50.280] - Speaker 1\
So if we haven't met yet, hi, I am Trina. I am a YouTube and video content strategist. I have a master's degree in business, and I really help business owners scale their business through video content. I've been using YouTube and video content in my business since I started over five years ago, because when I started my business, I knew the fastest way to build my authority and be looked at as legit and create those relationships quicker. I had to show up on video. I knew absolutely nothing about editing, filming, cameras, microphones, none of that stuff. So I had to self-teach myself all of that, plus self-teach myself everything about YouTube because back then there wasn't really a whole YouTube culture yet. Now with my YouTube strategy and my video content strategy and the way I multiply my content that I'm about to show you. I have a sales team of videos on YouTube and my blog working for me 24 hours a day, seven days a week, constantly driving me new traffic. Now I can enjoy three-day weekends with my little ones. When I need some mommy time alone, I can have that because I've created this space and got off of that content creation hamster wheel.\
\
[00:11:13.720] - Speaker 1\
Video content has allowed me to get my time back in my day to actually live my life and in return, scale my business. Right now, maybe you're stressed. You feel like you've never had time to do everything before. How are you going to have time to do video content. You're probably already creating loads of content as it is, Instagram, your blog, like we said. And you're like, Yes, Trina. Yes, I am ready to get off of that content creation hamster wheel. Or maybe you're ready to have brands actually reach out to you to want to sponsor a blog post or want to work with you on a blog post. Or maybe you want to see that affiliate income clicking up and up and up because you have more people coming to your blog and you have more people wanting to buy the things that you're talking about in your blog. So let's dig in. We get stuck in this cycle of doing the same things in our business or on our blog over and over again because that's the way we've always done it. We get really comfortable, right? That's the way they say it works.\
\
[00:12:18.290] - Speaker 1\
I talked about this infamous they, or it's what I know, right? You already have this blog writing system in process. You're good, you're comfortable, you're in your safe little box, right? Well, what we have been seeing more and more in the past few years is studies show us we are spending over 2 hours a day on social media. So maybe that's why you're starting to reach out and create more content on different platforms like Instagram and Pinterest because you know you can get more people to buy your affiliate links or make your blog look more valuable to brands. But you don't have to keep recreating new content to put out on these platforms. You need to start thinking about that content smarter and creating a repurposing strategy so that you're not creating new content over and over. Back to that hamster wheel again, right? So how are you going to break out on these platforms a lot faster without creating more content? Well, that's what we're here to talk about today. We're here to talk about video, but it's time to get strategic with your videos. Otherwise, creating any video out there for any social platform or your blog is basically like throwing spaghetti at a wall.\
\
[00:13:29.740] - Speaker 1\
It It may stick, it may drive more traffic, or it could fall completely flat. So I really want to help you make sure those videos are really working for you. So that's what I'm going to talk about, why we need to focus on using YouTube as the hub of our content. And I know as bloggers, this can be a little bit scary because you're like, I'm already creating blogs. That's my jam. I'm not on YouTube. But I really want to walk you through the importance of YouTube because it's the second largest search engine in the world, and it's owned by Google, which I know so many of you are trying to show up at the top of Google search. I'm going to talk about how YouTube and implementing this clear video strategy on YouTube is going to help you get two posts showing up on the front page of Google, right? You also need to remember that this year alone, in 2020, over 80% of internet traffic is going to be to video. So it's time for you as a blogger to really accept that video is that next step to see the growth in your blog that you really want to see.\
\
[00:14:34.510] - Speaker 1\
Also, YouTube has grown significantly. You can see on mobile devices alone, YouTube reaches more adults ages 18 to 49 than primetime television Vision. I'm talking like, this is us. Youtube reaches the same amount of people as this is us. Over 50% of YouTube's audience is female. So if you're really targeting those women, those moms, this is your place. 68% of 68% of YouTube users watch video to help them make a purchase decision. So why not have your affiliate link in that YouTube video so they can purchase that product after watching your video talk about it? And 80% of YouTube users who watch the video to help them make a purchase decision said they watched the video at the beginning of the shopping process. This just goes to show how important incorporating some type of a YouTube video into your blog post is really going to finally move that needle forward in your business. In fact, YouTube is one of the fastest-growing platforms. We hear a lot about Facebook and how it's the largest platform. But in 2018 alone, YouTube grew the largest out of all of these platforms. People use YouTube 63% more than they did in the previous year.\
\
[00:15:50.990] - Speaker 1\
So you can see how what really this is the platform to be at here in 2020. Again, if you think, well, my audience is on Facebook or on Pinterest. If you look at this chart, it's a little confusing to read, but if you go over to the up top, use YouTube. 95% of people who use YouTube use Twitter. 95% of people who use YouTube... I'm sorry, I said that wrong. 95% of people who use Twitter, also use YouTube. 95% of people who use Instagram, also YouTube. 87% of people who use Facebook, also use YouTube. If you go down all of those, people use YouTube widely across all these platforms. So whether you think they're on Pinterest or they're on Snapchat, your audience is also using YouTube. But I don't want you to fear. I'm thinking, holy cow, a new platform. Like I said, I don't have the time to do video. My to-do list is already jam-packed. We don't need to be overwhelmed. There is a simple, easy to follow formula that you can use to create a month's worth of video for all of the platforms in just eight hours. And you'll be able to permanently remove some of those to-dos on your list with a repurposing plan that gets you on more platforms, reaching more people, and spending less time doing it.\
\
[00:17:08.580] - Speaker 1\
So can I get a praise hand emoji, like something down in the comments that you're excited to hear this step-by-step platform? I just want to address a couple of little things that might be holding you back from actually committing to this before we jump in. So maybe you're thinking, Well, Trina, I'm already creating content. That's fantastic. That's amazing. I'm going to show you how this content is going really help you in my step by step plan. But videos really increase that know, like and trust. It feels like that viewer knows you, and this is going to skyrocket your credibility and make you look much more valuable to a brand When they are looking for partners for sponsored posts, they know you have that connection with your audience because you're showing up on video and making that extra step with that connection. Maybe you're telling me, Trina, well, I'm already doing blog posts, so my time is booked. I totally understand I'm doing blog posts, too. But what makes my blog post more valuable in Google's eyes is I am embedding my video to my blog. So not only does my blog post show up at the top of Google Search for a lot of my search terms because Google, I'm sorry, is going to put my videos at the top of Search.\
\
[00:18:22.060] - Speaker 1\
They're going to put my blogs at the top of Search because they know that blog has video content and they value video content. So not only does blog pop to the top of Google Search, but also my YouTube video is at the top of Google Search. So now instead of having no content at the top of Google Search for certain keywords, I now have two, a blog post and a YouTube video. Super, super powerful when it comes to Google SEO. Or maybe you're thinking, Okay, cool. Yeah, I get it, but my people just aren't on YouTube. And that's a logical statement, and I totally get it. But like I said, to that, do your people search Google Like I said, YouTube is the second largest search engine. Google owns YouTube and your content can show up in Google, even if you have both YouTube and Google. Finally, the last one I really want to hit home is, what if YouTube is just a fad, Trina? There's TikTok, there's Snapchat, there was the other Periscope. What if it's just a fad and they waste my time? Look, more and more brands are looking to the YouTube world to make lucrative brand deals with creators.\
\
[00:19:29.260] - Speaker 1\
Why? Because most of those people on YouTube share a deeper connection with their audience by showing up on video on YouTube. So brands know that their people will buy what they recommend. A great story is, I'm not sure if you follow the beauty world, But Shane Dawson had this makeup launch back in October, and he had never did anything makeup-wise before. But he took people on the journey. He shared the video process, and that collection blew out makeup statistics across the board. It sold out in less than a few hours. The reason why is because the viewers were invested. The viewers felt connected. He created that relationship with them, and that just made his merchandise, his products, way more valuable. That makes his name as a creator way more valuable to brands out there moving forward. Let's just sit to all those excuses. I broke it all down, and let's start getting strategic with our time content. If you're ready, let me know you are ready. You are ready to roll. You want to know my process. We're going to walk through this three-step process. It's going to go research. If you want to write this down, research, create, and then repurpose.\
\
[00:20:45.050] - Speaker 1\
We're going to make sure you're repurposing the wrong way because there is a wrong way to repurpose. Let's jump into step one research. You really need to think about the videos, especially if you're going to be creating them on YouTube. Even if you're going to be creating them for your blog, you want You want to make sure you're creating content that your audience is searching for so that when they go to Google to search for something, your blog posts are actually showing up, your videos are actually showing up. Because the worst thing I want to happen for you is to spend time creating your videos and then have crickets. That's the worst thing that can happen. I want to help you minimize this. When you're researching, we're going to look at YouTube, we're going to look at Pinterest, and you want to check some Facebook groups as well. What this looks like when you go to YouTube is YouTube is going to give you video ideas. Youtube is going to give you a blog post ideas. All you have to do is go into YouTube and go to the search bar and start typing out a topic, any topic that you want to talk about.\
\
[00:21:44.100] - Speaker 1\
It's really easy to figure out these videos because as you start typing it in, I started typing in when to post to Instagram. And these are the actual search terms that are most popular on YouTube. People are searching this. So create a post about this. So whatever your niche is, just go in to YouTube search and start typing in that niche and see what YouTube is populating for you. This is another example. I started typing in brand photography. I have a lot of photographers that are students of mine. And so when I type in brand photography, you can see video ideas, blog post ideas right off the bat. Brand photography tips, brand photography ideas, brand clothing for brand photoshoot. So what can you wear during a brand photography? Again, YouTube is giving you all the details to make sure when you post a video or you upload a blog or write a blog, you don't hear cricket. Now, if we move... I'm sorry, I'm a mover, so it's hard for me to sit still. If we go over to Pinterest and type in the same thing, brand photography. You can see the actual search terms people are using on Pinterest.\
\
[00:22:49.140] - Speaker 1\
Again, because we want to make sure we're getting in front of our audience's eyes quicker and faster. So brand photoshoot ideas, brand photography, brand photography inspiration. These are the types of topics you want to be creating blog posts around to really skyrocket the traffic to your blog. Here's another one, what to post on Instagram. If you just start scrolling through here, you can see all of those headlines and what people are actually reading on Instagram to really help you figure which blogs you should be writing and turning into video content, more importantly. You're going to spend about 30 minutes. Remember, we're breaking this down into eight hours. This only is going to take you eight hours. Remember Parkinson's law? Work expands to the amount of time you give it. You're going to research four videos, a 30 minutes for each video. This is the really important part because I don't want you wasting time on the wrong videos. I want you to move your needle. I want you to move the needle forward on your blog the fastest way possible. You're going to research these videos. You're going to spend 30 minutes on one video.\
\
[00:23:59.010] - Speaker 1\
We're going to do four at time because remember, there are four weeks in a month. You're going to spend two hours researching these videos. Before you're like, holy heck, I don't have two hours, remember, this is your content. Think about all that time you're creating on content. Once a week. You only have to do this once a month. So two hours. Now tell me in the chat, how are you coming up with your video ideas right now or your blog post ideas? Let me know in the chat. A lot of people go to Google, some go to Facebook Facebook, I want to hear from you where you're getting your ideas right now. Let's move into step two, which is create. Here's the key to making a video super easy for you and also quicker, because what happens is people spend a lot of time filming their video, and then they have this massive raw video file, and then it takes them hours to edit it. By following this formula I'm about to share with you, it's going to help you save time filming, it's going to help you save time editing, it's going to help you save time repurposing, which is the key here.\
\
[00:25:03.530] - Speaker 1\
Remember, we're saving time and get you more action takers, get you more affiliate revenue, get you more people following you and being more valuable to a brand. So here is that formula. Get your pen out. This is exactly how you're going to craft a script for your videos. You need to be able to hook your audience in the first 5 seconds of your video, because if you can hook them in the first 3-5 seconds, they're going to decide or not to click off of your blog or your video. Remember, we want them to watch you, to build that extra special relationship with you. When they see you on video, they're going to be able to connect with you, but you have to hook them first. They got to watch your content first. When I talk about hooking your video, I'm talking about really thinking about that pain point they're struggling. Let's say you have an Amazon affiliate for organizing, right? You're thinking about that person on the other end who's really struggling with organizing their refrigerator. Let me talk about a topic that I struggle with. You're talking about organizing your refrigerator, and you're going to list all of these products you recommend buying on Amazon.\
\
[00:26:11.340] - Speaker 1\
You want to think about where is that person really struggling with that you're going to get them bought into what you're about to share. You may hook them with something. Maybe you even show your refrigerator before, or you say something like, If you're tired of never being able to find anything in your refrigerator and constantly finding expired food, I'm going to show you in this video how to clean up your refrigerator and make your refrigerator look more pinches-worthy. Again, I'm just coming up with that at the top of my head, thinking about the pain point that I struggle with. I have food that goes expired. I don't even know there's some stuff in there because it's tucked around in the back. So you really want to think about that pain point that that audience is struggling with that they're going to buy into your video. So hook them. When you're going to move into your intro and you want to keep this really short, remember, they're bought into your hook. They need to see the meat of that content pretty quickly. So this is just your elevator pitch, your name, your title, and who you serve.\
\
[00:27:09.890] - Speaker 1\
So for me, in every single video that I create, I say, Hi, welcome back. My name is Trina. And on this channel, I help you build your confidence on YouTube. Super simple to the point. They know they've come here to build their confidence on YouTube. Then you've got to get to that content, the meat of your content within the first 15 to 30 seconds. And you really want to be able to share that in a step-by-step process. You probably already do this on your blog post, so you're already thinking in that way. So steps, lessons, advice, go through that process and easy to follow. Then here is the key to get action-takers, to get people to buy from your affiliate or to follow you more often or to become that loyal following. Now, there is a strategy if you're looking to grow on YouTube as well, build that presence on YouTube. You do that as well. But you really want to customize just the ending of your video. So the last 10 seconds of your video, you may do four different endings so that we can cut that in in editing to look like it's been made for every single platform.\
\
[00:28:13.850] - Speaker 1\
Ten second ending four different platforms, that's like a minute of your time, right? So in YouTube, you may say, watch that next video where I share how I shop for my organization tools, or maybe you tell them to subscribe to your channel. Instagram, maybe if you post it to Instagram TV or Instagram stories. Maybe you say something like DM me, comment below. Or Facebook, maybe you say something like share this video with another friend that's struggling with their refrigerator woes or like this page for more content like this. This is what's going to absolutely make your content stand out amongst the rest. So again, putting this all into eight hours, right? I only want you to spend about 10 to 15 minutes scripting this video. Every single video should be spent 10 to 15 minutes scripting it. We don't have to write word for word. Just know where your content is going. And I find that when you do read from a teleprompter or when you worry about reading word for word, it stresses you out more. So really hone in on that hook. That's the most important part, then let the middle of the content flow a little bit and have this alternate ending.\
\
[00:29:21.030] - Speaker 1\
So it's going to take you about an hour to script these four videos. So we're looking at three hours of time right now. Then you're going to give yourself about an hour and to film. Remember, we are putting time limits on this. We do not have to shoot this massive video. We don't have to shoot a massive video. 5, 10 minutes, that's all you really need to do. Just give them the very quick ways to get a clear win at the end of your video. You're spending about an hour and a half to film those videos. Ten minutes for each video, you're good. You're building that trust. Now, I know showing up on video can be scary. You're looking at all the other people that are already doing this on YouTube and you're like, Holy cow, I'm not as good as them. I'm not as pretty as them. My voice sounds terrible. Maybe you're older and you're like, I've got wrinkles. I've got them too. But you aren't alone. And imposter syndrome is real. I show up on YouTube every day thinking about, Holy cow, who am I to talk about this? And then I remind myself, I've done this.\
\
[00:30:22.090] - Speaker 1\
I've grown YouTube channels. I know what I'm talking about. So if you've organized your refrigerator and you've kept it clean, you've done You're good enough to talk about this. Also, you do not have to make everybody happy. There are going to be people out there that are going to say, Well, that's not how to do it. That's not how I would do it. That is absolutely fine. We are not out there to make everybody happy. I just really want you to understand that you do know enough to be on video. You can show up. You are your own special unicorn. That's what that gift is there for. I just wanted to give you that pep talk because I understand how difficult sometimes it can be to show up on video, but you can do this. You can be you and still do well on video. I want you to write this in your notes right now. If you're taking any notes or put this on a post-it and stick it on your computer, stick it in your office, stick it on your mirror that you wake up to every morning. You are good enough to be the face of your business or your blog.\
\
[00:31:24.880] - Speaker 1\
You are good enough to show up as the writer, as the content creator. You are good enough, okay? Write that down. Say it every single day, say it multiple times a day. Trust me, you are good enough. So now here we go. We're moving into that repurposing strategy that you are so anxious to hear. And so here's what happens. You create that video for YouTube, which is your hub, and it shows up on YouTube, it shows up on Google. Amazing, right? So you create that YouTube video. You then put that video on Facebook because you edited that Facebook ending. You then maybe send that video out to a newsletter. If you have a newsletter, you then can transcribe that or flush out your script, and you have a blog post that you can embed a video to. Double the SEO juice for Google, right? Again, if you have funnels in place for your email system, you can use that video there. You can create video pins, and we have seen massive success with video pins in my own business. You can turn that first 15 15 seconds of your video into a video pin on Pinterest.\
\
[00:32:34.760] - Speaker 1\
You can share that video on Instagram, too. Look at that one video that's going to all these different places, right? This is your multiplying formula right here. So how is this going to be possible? Templates, templates, templates, my friends. Doing this first round is going to take you a little more time than doing the second round because you need to set up templates for your Facebook. You want to make sure it is dimensioned for Facebook. You want to make sure it looks native to Facebook, and you want to make sure it stands out on Facebook. So creating one Facebook template is all you got to do. And then you just constantly put that video on that template that you created the first time around. Then you're going to do the Same thing for IGTV. So every time you put that IGTV video up, even if you're shooting horizontally and not vertically, it still looks well on Instagram. Same with your stories, same with your pins, and same with YouTube thumbnails, which is really critical if you're going to people on YouTube to actually watch your video. This is what templates are going to look like.\
\
[00:33:35.410] - Speaker 1\
Your template for a YouTube thumbnail may look like this, and then your Facebook template may look like this because remember, Facebook likes square video, and square video really stands out on Facebook. Then you got your Instagram TV or your Instagram stories. And then you got your video pin that might look something like this. So these look like templates. Let's see what this looks like in my business so you can get a sense of how this really looks. So you'll see up in the corner, that is my thumbnail on YouTube. It's much more catchy. People are more likely to click on that. Then you see down below, is video content killing your business? That is my Facebook video, and I'm taking the transcript so that I have captions underneath. Then I have that Instagram story or Instagram TV there in the middle, this one right here. Then this is my video pin where this video actually plays. It's 15 seconds and it plays. Creating these templates allows you to do this. Then this video pin. Oh, no, it's not going to work for me. This video pin looks something like this. Give it a second here.\
\
[00:34:41.000] - Speaker 1\
I'm going to tell you a little secret. Obviously, you won't be able to hear it on Pinterest, but that's going to stand out on Pinterest, right? And maybe your IG TV or your Instagram stories look something like this when you post it to make it super easy to post.\
\
[00:34:54.800] - Speaker 2\
I'm going to tell you a little secret about video content.\
\
[00:34:57.560] - Speaker 1\
And again, this can all be Templated. All you need to do is change out the video, change out the text. Super easy to do. So let's break this down. How is this all working in a eight-hour time frame? Because remember, we're taking that time you're spending per week. Maybe you're spending five hours per week creating content. Time's that by four. That's 20 freaking hours, right? This is just eight hours a month. You're going to spend two hours researching four videos. You're going to take one hour to script those four videos. Remember, you You have to stay in these boundaries. You have to set boundaries on your time. Otherwise, it's going to expand to the amount of time you give it. You're going to take 2 hours to film those videos, so about 30 minutes for each video to film. Then you're going to take 4 hours to edit, plot them into templates, and then schedule them. And your content is done for the month. You're showing up on YouTube, you're showing up on your blog, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, all of the places. One video a week for an entire month. Maybe your content plan looks something like this.\
\
[00:36:01.100] - Speaker 1\
Monday, you do your YouTube video. Tuesday, you do your blog post. Wednesday, you email your newsletter if you have one. Thursday, you do a Facebook post. Friday, you post on Instagram. Saturday, you do an IGTV episode because listen, somebody is not following you on all of these places. Maybe your mom, maybe your best friend. But most people are not catching your content all the time. So putting the same piece of content on multiple platforms is totally okay because there's people that are hooked on Facebook may not be on YouTube. There's people who are on YouTube may not be on Pinterest. So creating one piece of content and repurposing it strategically across all the platforms gets you in front of more people, gets more traffic to your blog, and finally moves that needle forward in your business or blog. So you have got to stop running this hamster wheel of creating content for every single platform and get more strategic, okay? You need to actually get that space back in your life again to enjoy your life and stop doing what they say and creating constant content. Okay, so that was a lot. I know. Totally understand.\
\
[00:37:07.800] - Speaker 1\
I covered a lot. Who feels like this is totally doable? You can actually see you Getting your life back right now. Let me know in the comments if you're like, Holy cow, I think I can actually schedule a massage or a manicure next month once I get this process in place. Let's just recap again, if you want to scribble these notes down or take a screenshot. We first talked finding the right video ideas that will convert. Convert to affiliate clicks, convert to loyal followers to make you look more valuable to a brand. You learn how to create a month's worth of powerful video content in just eight hours. And you learn why you don't need to focus on just one social platform to be successful because somebody is not following you on all those platforms. And even if they are, they aren't catching that content every single time you post it, right? You learn how to use YouTube and Pinterest to get in front of your target audience super fast because these are search engines and these are so powerful for you. You also learn why you need to follow this video format to get the most out of your content because I want to make sure you're creating content that connects with the viewer and also gets them to take action, whatever that action is you want them to do.\
\
[00:38:21.620] - Speaker 1\
You saw that it doesn't take more time to create all this video content. In the end, it's probably saving you time, right? If you're spending 20 hours a month creating content, I just cut your content creation time in half so you can finally enjoy your life again and spend time with your family. Maybe you can take those Fridays off like I have last year and really enjoy that time off as well. But here's the thing. I'm not going to leave you high and dry here because I know this can be a huge task to undertake. I want to give you this video multiplier roadmap, which is going to show you how I create all of these and also gives you the dimensions to every single video. You can start creating those templates with the right dimensions and a bonus point. If you take... I don't want you to create new content, right? I want you to take one of your most popular blog posts or maybe your most engaging one that you got the most comments on and turn it into a video. You probably already have loads of blog posts in your library of content.\
\
[00:39:20.140] - Speaker 1\
Take your most popular blog post right now and turn it into a video. When you do and you upload it on YouTube and embed it into your blog post, send me the link to that blog. I will go watch it. I will give you feedback. I will help you figure this out because I don't want you to do it alone. I challenge you to see if once you add that video to that blog post, does it do even better? Does it jump to the top of Google search results? Does your video show up at the top of search results? So you have seven days, so one week, to send me the link to your video. And like I said, I will give you feedback to help you continue in this video creation process and multiplying your content. Okay, got it? So you can get this PDF at trinalittle. Com/vmf. And you can also email me that video at trina@trinalittle. I would love to give you feedback on it because I know what it's like to struggle and to spend time on content creation. I don't want anybody else to have to think they have to create constant content to be successful because it is so not true.\
\
[00:40:29.990] - Speaker 1\
So one thing I really, really want you to take away from this because look, I know you may be going out of your box here, out of your comfort zone and getting on video. You are good enough to be the face of your business or your blog. I know maybe you're just creating a blog, but your blog is your business. And look, you really need to show up as that leader on your blog to create those connections, to really get people to take action for you. Okay? I know it's tough, but I know you can do it. So remember to grab this as soon as possible. Send me that link within the next week so I can give you feedback on your video. And I cannot wait to see what this does for your schedule. And if you can finally get your life back and off that content creation hamster wheel.\
\
[00:41:16.680] - Speaker 3\
All right, Trina, thank you so much. I have a lot of work to do in my eight hours this month, but I'm excited to give this a go and get back to video, especially the other sessions we have in this summit. I'm like, I really want to get back to I enjoy it. So now that I feel like I have a way to accomplish that, thank you so much. You have a free offer for attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:41:39.310] - Speaker 2\
Yeah, it's actually my video multiplier roadmap. And so in there, it takes you through every single piece of content that you can create with one video. This is really going to save a lot of your time in that content creation because you post a blog post, you want to get the word out in as many places as possible. So this is going to show you all the different places you can multiply that content to. And then what's really important, I'm giving you all the dimensions for all the video places. So the dimensions for stories, Instagram stories, Instagram TV, LinkedIn, Facebook, any video platform you can stick it on. I give you all the dimensions inside of there.\
\
[00:42:16.080] - Speaker 3\
Okay, awesome. Thank you guys. Definitely go grab that. The link and the information for that is below this video. I'm definitely going to go sign up because, like I said, I've been wanting to get back to video. So thank you, Trina, so much. Any just final words for anyone?\
\
[00:42:29.520] - Speaker 1\
Yeah, if you're wondering what your first step is, just create a video.\
\
[00:42:35.930] - Speaker 2\
I use the analogy getting on a bike. You're never going to be able to learn to ride that bike. If you don't just get on, there will be falls, bumps, and bruises. But you keep going at it, you'll get better at it, and you just got to start.\
\
[00:42:49.280] - Speaker 3\
All right. Yes. Thank you so much. I learned a lot today. I know everyone else did, too. Definitely go check out her site, guys.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.550] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
All right, guys, I'm really excited to be here with Alisa from Tailwind, so thank you so much for joining me.\
\
[00:00:15.190] - Alisa Meredith, tailwindapp.com\
Yeah, I'm thrilled to be here.\
\
[00:00:16.810] - Liz\
Yeah. For anyone that doesn't know you and your background, would you mind just sharing a little bit so they know where you're coming from as we talk Pinterest today?\
\
[00:00:24.320] - Alisa\
Of course. Of course. I have been going for three and a half years as a Pinterest product specialist and manager there. And prior to that, I have run marketing agencies and just ended up specializing more and more towards Pinterest advertising. And I'm just a big believer in Pinterest marketing in businesses. And bloggers have a huge opportunity as well.\
\
[00:00:49.780] - Liz\
Yeah, because Pinterest wouldn't exist without content creators.\
\
[00:00:53.080] - Alisa\
Yes. Exactly.\
\
[00:00:56.040] - Liz\
Okay. So, I feel like people start learning about Pinterest, and they there's a gazillion experts out there telling them to do a gazillion different things. You need multiple pins. It all needs to match. It doesn't need to match. You need to pin this many times a day. No, it's actually this many times at. What do they actually need to do? What could they maybe take off their plate? What should be the focus I guess?\
\
[00:01:22.620] - Alisa\
You bring up a good point. And I think a lot of those rules happen because well-meaning teachers want to give people a place to start, right? Yeah. There's also that 80, 20, 80 percent of other people find 10, 20 percent of your own, that it's not the other way around. Yeah. Or the other way around. Right. It's the thing that was made up, I think, to help people, because we like we like we like absolutes.\
\
[00:01:46.830] - Alisa\
And that was just a place for people to start. But I think to get beyond that and think about your content, right. Is all about you and your content. There is no reason to feel like, I need to be a professional curator of content. And I don't want it to look like I'm only promoting my own stuff. That's not a consideration on Pinterest to . The biggest benefit is going to come from sharing your own content. And a lot of times people are very generous and they want to support their friends and others and maybe they want to save something for themselves to read later. But the concentration should be on your own. So, just get that in mind first. That can be helpful.\
\
[00:02:27.990] - Liz\
Yeah, because when I think about I feel bloggers sometimes forget because they use Pinterest, so differently from the average user. And so when you actually go and Pinterest to look for something, you think about how you're using it in terms of does it matter? Are you looking at the profile and saying they're only publishing their content? [laughs] I don't.\
\
[00:02:47.880] - Alisa\
You know, well and too, now that the business profiles are a little bit different when you go to someone's profile, Pinterest has arranged it. So, what you see is, first of all, pins that a creator has made right. You have to go to a different view to see anything they say is of anybody else's. So, Pinterest is really giving you the green light to focus on your own content. They want you to get the credit for your content.\
\
[00:03:15.090] - Liz\
Yes, and then I mean, 2020 was the year of "We need fresh pins." That seems to be going back a little bit, just like hashtags did a couple of years ago in 2021. So, what is sort of your stance on the fresh pin or pin design strategy?\
\
[00:03:33.950] - Alisa\
So, when it was first apparent that what Pinterest when I was fresh pins, there was an understanding that that means new images for all of us. But it has been updated, and what they really want is fresh ideas. They want fresh content, which means contents on site. So, they want a new blog post. They want a new product. They want a new idea. They want a page.\
\
[00:04:02.160] - Alisa\
Pinterest put out some videos somewhere on YouTube, which were really quite revealing, a little bit funny. There was one it's about bananas and it's a message to creators. And it says, "One point four million people are searching for banana ideas. So, we want your banana ideas, but not banana bread like we have those." So, what they show, like banana sushi and all these kind of beautiful, different things. There's no fish at all which is funny. But they did that also with. Fashion, I think, in green, that had a large search volume, but were just overrun with duplicates.\
\
[00:04:48.490] - Liz\
With one thing.\
\
[00:04:48.760] - Alisa\
Yeah, yeah, I would agree it was we don't need any more succulents. So the key is really trying to find a brand new idea. And so that's tough, right. Because what takes most of our time in marketing is creating content.\
\
[00:05:05.390] - Liz\
Yes, but. That's what's going to work, right, and that's what we're finding as we look at the pin that are going out the very first time you are elbows out, it's often going to get the most engagement per person. It doesn't mean that you can never share the pin again, because we do see that those still will create engagement and will drive traffic as well.\
\
[00:05:31.120] - Alisa\
But something that we've encouraged a bit is to think about the content that you have in the ways you could create new ideas from your own content. So it's not a fresh pin in the sense of how Pinterest would describe it. To them that's like a brand new URL right.\
\
[00:05:48.350] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:05:48.430] - Alisa\
Right out the gate. And we're not talking about taking your blog posts and changing up the URL so you can pin it again.\
\
[00:05:55.970] - Liz\
We have a whole broken link having to read, don't that.\
\
[00:05:59.230] - Alisa\
No, it's legitimately a new piece of content that they really want.\
\
[00:06:03.990] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:06:04.510] - Alisa\
But you can have some benefits by thinking about your idea, your product, whatever it is on that page, and thinking about it in a different context. So, for example, I use this awful lot, because I just saw randomly on Pinterest when I was looking for an example, is a Happy Harvest, has this garden cherry bourbon smash [inaudible 00:06:27] beautiful pin of course. So, let's say you have a piece of content like that. You can present it just as it is the garden cherry bourbon smash. But you can also think about, all right, let's think about some kind of context that would be a little bit niche that we can frame around this. So, that about. All right. What if I know there are people out there who are really into bourbon, right. So, you can frame it as the next big bourbon cocktail or somebody planning a wedding like the signature wedding cocktail of 20 to one.\
\
[00:07:08.020] - Alisa\
So, think about these different ways. You can present this information that you have and create a new pin for that. What you do not want to be creating two dozen pins for the same piece of content and then have it show up in the same search.\
\
[00:07:22.830] - Liz\
Yeah, that's not a whole lot of good.\
\
[00:07:25.320] - Alisa\
That's annoying, right? So you may get rewarded for spam, it just it's not a good user experience and it's a. One simple rule is always going to be think about what Pinterest what they wants. They want new, they want fresh, they actually want quality. Any time you can give them that, they're going to do great.\
\
[00:07:43.890] - Liz\
Yes, so then when it comes to coming up with new ideas, I guess I know this has been released in the last year or so, Pinterest has a trends like go to Trends. Pinterest.com will be a helpful place to start. [laughs] It's awesome. And so few people know about it. What are some other ways you could get find those new ideas or come up with anything? Because it is kind of hard to sit there and be like, here's a topic. It's kind of like staring at a blank page [laughs].\
\
[00:08:15.150] - Alisa\
You're right. But I would start at Trends.Pinterest.com and look at what's trending this week and that have the major industries and the categories. There's probably something there. If you don't see that there, enter in your search term and then related terms and see what's trending right now or if you're planning ahead. All the trends is amazing.\
\
[00:08:38.290] - Alisa\
Other things we look at is Pinterest 100 from. Last year, they made ten overall predictions, and all but two of them were proved right. So, what they're doing is looking at what they think will be trending this year. And the ones I missed last year were. Something like travel like an airport-\
\
[00:09:03.000] - Liz\
They couldn't predict.\
\
[00:09:05.880] - Alisa\
Yes. And the other was balance like mind, body, balance, something like that, we were all a mess.\
\
[00:09:14.830] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:09:14.950] - Alisa\
But everything else I got right then some things are a little far out, like I didn't even know what they're talking about, but that's life these days. So, check out the Pinterest 100, they have it so you can sort it by your audience; so, by generation basically. And you can sort of by your industry. And then you can find out like what what's going to be possibly trending.\
\
[00:09:36.040] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:09:36.490] - Alisa\
Another way is every month Tailend puts out these toolkit templates. So, we also have them built into our product. So, we have something called Tailend Create, which is new as of end of October, where you can put in your URL, it pulls out the title of your page, pulls in your images and then gives you like literally thousands of options to choose from to then tweak and just go right up there. There are different ways you can filter the designs and one of the ways is to look for trending content for that month.\
\
[00:10:12.980] - Alisa\
Okay, so if you looked for December, you would get Widgery, you would get Christmas, you would get the big game, because even though Super Bowl is for a month or something, it's going to show you what you should be thinking about pitting right now, in preparation for what's about to take off.\
\
[00:10:33.670] - Liz\
Yeah, because unlike other platforms on Pinterest, you almost want to be a couple of months ahead. So, that your pin has time to get traction; when it actually is trending that's where your pin will pop-up.\
\
[00:10:48.520] - Alisa\
Exactly. And that's why we use we use a trends tool to figure that out. And we also use the Pinterest Possibility Planner, which shows when those things start to heat up.\
\
[00:10:57.420] - Liz\
Okay. Sorry I make notes.\
\
[00:11:04.060] - Alisa\
No. Okay,\
\
[00:11:04.510] - Liz\
`So, in case anyone doesn't know, obviously the Tailwind Create is inside Tailwind. I was one of the early beta testers of it, it is pretty cool that all the things you do with it. Where would they find the Pinterest 100 and the possibility planner?\
\
[00:11:22.490] - Alisa\
See, I was just looking at that.\
\
[00:11:24.460] - Liz\
So, they know.\
\
[00:11:26.480] - Alisa\
I mean, obviously you could Google it. Yeah, it's. The other one is Pinterest possibilities, that one's a good one.\
\
[00:11:40.230] - Liz\
okay.\
\
[00:11:40.350] - Alisa\
Pinterest Predict.com.\
\
[00:11:43.790] - Liz\
Okay, Pinterest Predicts.com. Okay, so it's a great place. That's a great place to start. Get your ideas, figure out what content you're going to be creating. Once you've created content, then you're looking at creating a pen. And obviously eye-catching. Does it need to all be kind of branded? Does it. Does it matter. Do you think. What...?\
\
[00:12:07.370] - Alisa\
Yeah. Yeah. So, I think this is kind of a it's going to be a personal decision for everybody, but yes, definitely visually appealing. So, we make it fold. Also here is a little tip, when you're thinking about your keywords and you're going to create content that involves a keyword research that keyword. Chances are you're going to see one dominant color. So, if you search dinner recipes, everything is like this brown gold color and it all melts together. The only one I thought that stood out at all had this big, bright blue banner. Do that. Search for your keyword and then do something to it.\
\
[00:12:44.120] - Alisa\
Again, we talked about original ideas, so making it look cool in your pin, but also the attitude. Pinterest is a lot of people happy place. They want to go there to be inspired and to feel good about themselves and their lives and feel positive and optimistic. So, always, always keeping that in mind. They also want it to be relevant. So make sure that you're thinking about what's going on in the world today.\
\
[00:13:13.310] - Alisa\
It's probably not going to do great with a birthday party with 50 kids on top of each other with their hands in their face. That is scary to us right now. So, just think about the context of where you live. Like this is real life here on Pinterest. So, just be aware of what people are feeling and thinking, what would be attractive to them and what would not. Also, keeping it actionable and making sure they know what you want them to do with it. And that comes down to part of that being the branding. So, if you have, let's say, that photo of a beautiful chair and that's it. Someone might say, it's nice eye-candy, but someone who is actually shopping would have no idea that this is something I could go buy if you don't put your brand name on it. So, you definitely do want to brand your Pinterest. Pinterest is great for brand awareness because 97% of the searches there are unbranded, which means they're not already decided that they're going to buy a world market share. They may be very open to your share. Yeah, but make sure they recognize the brand. Yeah, it's your share and it's much more likely for them to convert if there is some branding on pin.\
\
[00:14:29.900] - Liz\
Always, at least the site name, I think. The colors don't always have to be your brand colors in my mind, right?\
\
[00:14:35.750] - Alisa\
Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing. People will say, well, "I want to keep everything consistent because of branding." And you know, that's fine. That's your choice. But what is more important to you? Is it the brand strict brand awareness and that slight recognition or is it traffic and sales? Because if it's traffic and sales, you probably want to be a little more flexible, especially on Pinterest, especially if you're starting out what is style is going to work and just be willing to try things.\
\
[00:15:05.150] - Liz\
Yeah, and Pinterest has been really great in terms of keeping the sizing the same of what they want the two by three ratio for. While people are doing what were called giraffe pins that are super long, but it seems that it's really just do the two by three don't do slightly taller, just do two buy three. Is that accurate?\
\
[00:15:22.700] - Alisa\
Two by three that's the standard. And they want 1000 by 1500 just to make sure the revolution is good. You can go up to 1000 by 2100 without getting cut off and some times they do perform really well.\
\
[00:15:37.010] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:15:37.170] - Alisa\
But you would not go wrong with the two to three.\
\
[00:15:41.750] - Liz\
Don't be doing landscape, that's for sure.\
\
[00:15:43.750] - Alisa\
Definitely not. You're just taking up more room with that. Talking about the branding, so I had Kristy Hill, a pretty well-known blogger on our Facebook live months ago. And she was telling us that she created some pins with Tailend free. And even though they weren't really her style, they worked with the brand and they were some of her top performing things at that time. So, you know, if you're willing to just try a little something different, you never know.\
\
[00:16:17.240] - Liz\
Yeah. Can we talk a little bit about pin type? Because there's just an image pin, there's video pins and anime pins which are considered video pins, but are different in terms of creation. They have the new story pin that I think we all want to die out, but you can't add a link to it.\
\
[00:16:40.040] - Alisa\
You cannot.\
\
[00:16:40.820] - Liz\
So, really not good for content creators. But like video versus image, what?\
\
[00:16:50.790] - Alisa\
So video pins, tend to be really well in the feed because that motion will catch your eye and so that results in a lot of video patterns that are really just a static pin with maybe a moving element on it. Right. So, maybe that'll catch people's eyes. Maybe not. But it doesn't really add a lot to the experience just to have a floating part and whatever. What what is more useful on Pinterest and where I see the engagement happening of course, engagement is not a vanity metric on Pinterest. Engagement tells Pinterest that, "Hey, this is good, good content. I should distribute it more, especially if your followers who are engaging." That's really what you want. So, what I'm seeing gets more engagement is a pin, a video that shows how to do something.\
\
[00:17:41.760] - Alisa\
So, an example I like to use is a DIY lava lamp. And this, just like the cover of it, is just looks like a regular pin, but then it's just a little boy at a kitchen table like no fancy anything, just moms taking a video of a kid making a lava lamp.\
\
[00:18:01.290] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:18:01.590] - Alisa\
And it it's a tremendous amount of engagement. So to me, if you can take video, it does not have to be fancy. We have I mean, there are lots of fancy ones out there that show how to make a recipe or, you know, showing the hands. It doesn't have to be fancy to do lot on Pinterest, which I think is wonderful because I think video can be very intimidating. I think one of the challenges with Pinterest video is that it's not always easy to find the link...\
\
[00:18:34.800] - Liz\
Unless it's a promoted.\
\
[00:18:36.300] - Alisa\
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that's a little tricky, but I still think videos are worth doing. So, you did mention there are gift pins, but I don't think those are worth the effort personally. There are carousels which are kind of like story accounts, but they never worked really well for me anyway. I don't why [laughs]. You mentioned the story pins- yeah there are no links out there. Like any time a new feature goes out, it's a good idea to try it if you can because more engagement on that, it's probably going to lift up your other content from that site.\
\
[00:19:17.410] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:17.710] - Alisa\
So, even though you're not getting the traffic from it, you may get followers who are going to engage with your feature content and then go over from there. It's worth a try, but I mean, story brands-\
\
[00:19:31.080] - Liz\
Don't rely on it.\
\
[00:19:32.670] - Alisa\
Don't rely on it for traffic. Certainly, certainly not. But I would definitely give them a try.\
\
[00:19:38.400] - Alisa\
At the Pinterest Prater's festival a few months back, it was all about the story, and it was all about we think you deserve more than a double tap. We want to connect you with pinners. And that's something, it's a very different direction for Pinterest. It'll be interesting to see how users respond to that. Yeah, yeah. I think they use them, but make sure you give a call to action to let them know where to go to find more. It is frustrating when you get to the end of some great idea and you want more and there's no link.\
\
[00:20:12.910] - Liz\
Yeah. I feel like it kind of reminds me of when they tried to do like communities or something a couple of years back.\
\
[00:20:20.460] - Alisa\
Yes.\
\
[00:20:20.690] - Liz\
That weren't was like, Okay, well, everybody was like, "I'm going to claim a community. So, I have it." But kind of didn't pan out. Okay. And the other question I want to talk to you about is focusing more on your own words or on group words. As long as their quality group words. I'm not saying, you know, I feel like I got to rely on- there's some- don't do the everything group or just because a lot of people on it. But niche specific quality group boards versus your own boards and sort of tending to them. Or if you should look at them.\
\
[00:20:56.010] - Alisa\
Yeah. In general, your on boards. And the reason for that is that. Pinterest created group boards for people to actually collaborate on, right? But what marketers figured out, as we always do, is that when you share a pin to a group board your pin will likely be shown to the followers of all the members in that group board. It seems like exponential reach. Well, they figured out what we figured out and they said, nope, it's not going to work that way anymore. So, you can't rely on group boards for increased distribution just because you put your pin in there.\
\
[00:21:30.980] - Alisa\
Now, if you actually have a group board where people do collaborate and they find your content interesting, they want to share it with your audience and they're actually doing that. That's great [laughs]. Like do that. But if that's not the case, don't.\
\
[00:21:46.460] - Alisa\
One of the ways that you can figure out what is going on, like which ones are working for you, Pinterest Analytics has board analytics and so does Tailend. So, you can go in there and see how is this group board doing and then you can click through to see how is my content doing. And you can filter it by date. So, you can see was it doing a couple of years ago and now it's terrible or should I keep using it. But definitely look. But generally it's zero all the time.\
\
[00:22:20.000] - Liz\
Okay. And then In terms of new ideas and fresh content, like do you find that people that are kind of regularly creating new boards on their profile, that it makes a difference or kind of what you set up with, the new boards?\
\
[00:22:34.780] - Alisa\
Oh, that's not something I've analyzed. But your boards also need to be centered around your content. So, the reason I would create a new board is if I started writing about a different topic. And then, yeah, even if I only had a couple pins for it, I would create that board. Because really, when you share your content at that first time, it needs to go to a very relevant board, so that Pinterest will get that signal. Okay. This is about. I don't know sterling silver teaspoons as opposed to, let's say you're going to write more about that. You're not just going to put it on your kitchen stuff board, you want it to be more specific. And that might be a little too specific honestly, unless you're going to put a new category on your blog or in product category.\
\
[00:23:23.090] - Liz\
Okay, yeah. So, I think I just wanted to kind of touch on that because it can be when you're doing all those new ideas, it doesn't mean you do everything [laughs] okay. So, any final things you think people need to need to know about Pinterest in 2021?\
\
[00:23:36.620] - Alisa\
I think just as always, think about what they want for their users. And when you hear these rules or these magical formulas that work, take it with a grain of salt, because there are a lot of kind of questionable tactics out there, so if it feels a little bit shaky, it probably is then just don't do it. Just honestly create great content for your readers. And then when you share it on Pinterest, it should do well.\
\
[00:24:17.510] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you so much for this information. I know. I actually learned a couple of new things, even though I've been on Pinterest for years. I know you have something for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it? \
\
[00:24:31.380] - Alisa\
Yeah. So, a couple things. One is a new webinar, The Everything Pinterest webinars, what we've nicknamed it. But basically it's everything you need to know to succeed on Pinterest. And it is new. It is updated. It's an hour long. So, it's really like everything [laughs]. So, there's that. And then if you use lots of affiliate links to sign up for, you get a month free. So, if you try it, there's no credit card required. You can try out the scheduling. You can create with the scheduling. Yeah, try it out.\
\
[00:25:06.980] - Liz\
Awesome. Alisa, Thank you so much. Hope I said your name right just then [laughs].\
\
[00:25:15.890] - Alisa\
You did.\
\
[00:25:16.070] - Liz\
Yeah. I was trying to remember how to say it. I think I did. Thank you again. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Catch you at the next session. I appreciate it.\
\
[00:25:24.270] - Alisa\
All right. Thank you.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.010] - Ana\
Let's talk about Pinterest. Shall we? Hi, there. My name is Ana and I'm a blogging coach and strategist, helping content creators increase their traffic and income online. One of the main ways that I include my blog traffic when I was a new blogger was with Pinterest and really harvesting the power of Pinterest. And in the last couple of years, I've done the same thing for my side blog that I've started [inaudible 00:00:33]. Pinterest does change, and you have to keep up with those things, but there are a couple of things that never change. So, in this video, I want to go over my most clicked Pins. So, here's my presentation about the secret sauce of click-worthy Pins. Don't get me wrong, having Pinterest followers and monthly views on Pinterest is a great thing. And seeing the growth in that means that your Pinterest account is growing and that your content gets distributed further. But when you look at the monthly page views, a lot of people put emphasis on it, while it doesn't necessarily mean that it converts really well into traffic for your blog. So, what I do instead is I focus on Pins that get a really high click-through rate.\
\
[00:01:16.490] - Ana\
So that's why I want to focus on this on today's presentations. There's a bunch of Pinterest strategies, resources out there that you can use to set up your account to create those Pins in the first place, and so on. So, I'm not going to be talking about a design perspective from a to-do point of view, but more a checklist on here's what's working for me and what I've noticed working for other Pins, and here's what you should try to replicate in your design and in your Pins look that will actually get you clicks. And again, I will look over Pins from both my main website, which is Blogging Focus, and my pet website, which obviously has a whole different audience to see if there are any overlapping Pins that do really well, or any elements that might [inaudible 00:02:02] on your own Pins that you should really try to incorporate. Basically, I'm going to try to help you create Pins that get you blog traffic. Let's get right into it.\
\
[00:02:12.600] - Ana\
So, instead of strategizing and trying to come up with things that I think would get clicks, what I'm going to do instead is go through my two Pinterest accounts. One, which is for my main login website that you can see here, and another for my pet business, just so you can see how it performs in a non-marketing niche as well, and look at the most clicked Pins on there and see if we can spot any reoccurring themes. But first, you might be wondering, how can you tell which Pins get clicks? And there are two main ways, to do it. Before I get into the Pins, I'm going to quickly show you the ways so you can look at your own analytics and understand what's working in your niche or for your own audience, since that's so much more important than looking at what someone else is doing and trying to copy that. So, here it is. This is your business hub on Pinterest. You do need to have a business account to see the analytics. So, if you don't have that already, make sure you convert to a Pinterest account. It's totally free, easy to do.\
\
[00:03:11.280] - Ana\
And once you're in here, all you have to do is go to your analytics and overview. Once you get here, you'll see a bunch of data, but don't get too caught up in it. Here's what you need to do. Look at your Pins or standard Pins, because that's what we want to see that is performing, choose a date range. So, I'm going to go ahead and choose the last 90 days and add claim accounts. It's so important to choose your domain. Why? Because I want to see what Pins got click throughs from my own website rather than all the Pins that I added to Pinterest and share. And then I'm going to scroll here to top Pins and they are sorted by impressions, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But like I said, views don't actually equal traffic necessarily on Pinterest. So, just because for my top Pin, I got 26,000 impressions doesn't mean I got 26,000 click-throughs. All I care about is how well these converted. S,o instead I'm going to sort by outbound clicks. Why? Because Pin clicks is also when people click on the pin to enlarge it, it doesn't mean they landed on your website.\
\
[00:04:15.880] - Ana\
And outbound clicks is the ones that actually landed on your website from Pinterest. Wait a second for it to refresh. And you'll see here something so, so useful. Not only will you see your top Pins, and then when you hover over them, you see a preview of them and when it was first created, but you would also see the total clicks and the deconversion rate. So, here's something really interesting. The top pin that got the most clicks actually has a pretty low conversion rate, 1.2, is not terrible, but it's lower than my other pin, which has a conversion rate of 3.2. That's actually amazing. And you can see that this pin had 26,000 impressions and this one had way less, but this one converted twice the amount. So, what I like to do in cases like this, I will go over to the pin in question and you can click to view it and then really take this into consideration. This is a pretty simple Pin design that I made with a stock photo and I use it for a couple of different blog posts as well. And that converted really well. So, people really like seeing like a lifestyle shoot of sort that released your niche a little bit, so obviously, somebody blogging.\
\
[00:05:34.370] - Ana\
And it converts a little better than something that's just a written pin. But if you remember from analytics earlier, this pin had a lot of distribution. So, Pinterest really made sure people see it. And you can see it's a way taller pin than the pins that I usually make. That's something else that you can experiment with. Have you tried making slightly longer pins? They take more space in your actual feed, so they might be seen by more people. And then you might see something interesting happening in your top pins, which is a couple of designs are exactly the same. So, obviously, this is the exact design. If we click to view it, it converted a little less, but still quite good. And if you look at the difference between this pin and this pin, obviously they're the same image. Here's the main difference. The pin that converted the most was a pin that somebody else pinned to their board. It's one of my pins, but they pinned it there, right? And this pin still did quite well. So, proof that the image itself is converting quite well. But this is a pin that I initially created, and then somebody shared two design tips.\
\
[00:06:41.780] - Ana\
So, not the most relevant board to the topic in question, while this one was pinned by somebody else to Blogging. So, obviously, you can control what other people pin from your own pins and what boards they added, but it makes such a difference if they're able to add it to really relevant boards. Something else that I noticed is that my top pins are a combination of pins that were pinned, like, really recently, like November of this year, and a couple of pins I pinned earlier in the year, or one even in 2019. There you go, 2019, and so on. So, a couple of them are pinned last year. It's really a mixed bag, and a lot of the pins do take time to start ranking. If you keep scrolling, you'll probably see the same trend, March 2021, June 2021, 2018. Somebody still getting like a 6% conversion rate for a seasonal pin that I pinned in 2018. That is insane. So, what I'm saying to you is do not get discouraged. Obviously, there are three cases where a pin that you recently pinned could go viral and get loads of impressions and clicks, and obviously, that's the best case scenario, but that's not going to happen.\
\
[00:07:52.470] - Ana\
But what you want to do is make sure you push and distribute pins that you published a while back, especially for seasonal content. Just bring it back. Like, I pinned this originally in 2018, and it still brought me clicks and a 6% conversion rate. And especially around Christmas, I want to make sure to repin this exact image again by finding the initial pin. You also see that Pinterest recommends that I promote it as well, which is an interesting piece of insight. They're basically saying this could be relevant now. This converts really well for you, get more views to it. I don't usually promote my Pinterest pins. Pinterest is great for organic traffic if you're patient with it. But if you're one of trying to speed up your results, and if you see a Pin converts really well, and on the other side of that blog post, you have affiliate links or your own product that you can monetize, then by all means to try to put some ad budget behind it and see how it does. Because Pinterest could just get it in front of more people who would then convert at 6% or more.\
\
[00:08:52.200] - Ana\
So, obviously, that's a great piece of insight. I would never try to promote a Pin that I have no information about or how it's performing. But this really tells you what works and what doesn't. Something else that you might have noticed about my Pins is that they are all quite text-heavy because all of them don't have images like this one, although those do perform well. So, that's something for me to experiment with and add more kind of focus points for my photos. But a lot of them are really easy to read. You don't need, like in a busy feed, you're not trying to read the words. I make sure that my designs are really easy to read when you kind of scroll past it and that they have these kind of key points that people are getting drawn to. So, here like self-publish, ebook, things like that really stand out in pins like this. So, keep in mind that people don't see your Pin like this, they see it in a whole board like this. So, Pins that really stand out tend to be the ones that have really big keywords where you can kind of see. That's a little hard, like the great, it's kind of hard to see or read quickly.\
\
[00:09:56.880] - Ana\
It doesn't really draw the attention. But something like this, I spotted domain authority right away. This is quite a good one. This really brings the focus to the middle and leaves a little space to create that airiness around it. So, go through your own feed and see what kind of stands out. Like, this is a little too busy, on its own, would look really good. But when you kind of zoom out, it's so much happening in a whole feed that it wouldn't really be drawn to go to it. So that's something else that I try to watch for my Pins. And you might have noticed that a lot of my main designs that are getting clicks and so are not really very busy. I just keep them light. I just keep them focused on specific things like that one, and they do get clicks and they do convert. Now I'm going to do the same and take you behind the scenes of my other newer Pinterest account. Like you see here, I have like under 200 followers compared to the 40,000 that I have for my main account, but it still does quite well. I just don't post on it that often.\
\
[00:10:59.780] - Ana\
And it's a way newer account. So Pinterest takes a while to really trust your accounts and Pins. But I'm going to go analyze a couple of non-marketing Pins for you to see what works with maybe different audiences and see if I can learn anything about it myself. So, I'm going to go again to analytics overview. Again, make sure you're selecting traffic that comes to your own. Give it 90 days, so you can really track the progress. And we're going to go to top pins. I had a pin there that was seasonal for Halloween a while back, and it performed really, really well. But again, this is a Pin that I published in 2020, and it just now took off. Like, look at that. Even better than my main account Impressions in the last 90 days, which shows the power that even if you have a smaller Pinterest account and niche or you're starting it for a new blog, be patient with it. Because sometimes it just takes that little bit of time for Pinterest to resurface your content. So, again, I'm going to go by outbound clicks. No surprise that Pin is my top one, right?\
\
[00:12:06.810] - Ana\
So, it did really well for Halloween for funny dog costumes. The second one converted really well. Again, 4% conversion rate is actually quite good. And it's a Frenchie gift guide. So, pretty simple. Again, really easy to spot both the image and the breed. And the message is reinforced by Frenchie at the top and then must have and kind of the shopping list is basically what the post is. So, I think this Pin does a really good job at telling people what's on the other side. That's why it converted. And this is a Pin that I myself saved to obviously, a French bulldog board. So, something else that's really important in that, you might have noticed already in the trend of these Pins that get clicks and get resurfaced and really get pushed by Pinterest is Pinterest is sure of the topic. They know what the topic is about and that has a lot to do with the boards that it gets added to. And then we have a couple of really simple ones that, again, I created in Canva. And I just tried to add that visual element of plants for turtles. So, so, so simple.\
\
[00:13:15.060] - Ana\
You just need to draw people in, make sure you have some visual cues, because people do look on Pinterest very visually. And for this niche, it works a lot better than having just text alone, right? I can get away with it on my blogging business Pinterest, because there's not many images that I can use. You can only use so many images of laptops, but for other niches, the visual element is so, so important. So, do not think like that. Same goes for this Pin, where not only you have the visual element, but an arrow, which really draws the attention to, hey, this is what I'm referring to. Harnesses, right? Pay attention to this bit of the image, which you can also do if you have busier images. Just try to pull the focus and pull the attention on there. This also converted quite well. It's one of those taller pins that I experimented with. And again, it really seems like it did well. It also has a comment in there, which is interesting because I did notice this for a couple of my top Pins on both accounts, they have comments. They have some sort of engagement.\
\
[00:14:19.080] - Ana\
People don't really use Pinterest comments, but I just think that any engagement to your Pins really draws Pinterest to push your Pin further. So that's something that I maybe would experiment with in the future, trying to interact back and reply to people and trying to kind of start a conversation in the comments. If you get comments, or even the ones that are not too spammy, I will just leave them there. Obviously, if it's just like random links or stuff like that, I will delete those comments. But other than that, try to leave your comments there because it's good engagement. And then something else that I do, just to make sure that Pinterest knows and associates my Pin with the right topic, is that I try to vary the title of the Pin itself from what's written on the image. Pinterest can read, so their software can read words, especially when it's written and easier to read a font. I often have two or more Pins for the same post, so I do experiment with the titles and change them. But even on Pins where obviously this is the title of that Pin, I'll use synonyms or words that other people might use.\
\
[00:15:23.530] - Ana\
So, something like cockapoos, and then cocker spaniels dog names, because people just read them in specific ways. And then I make sure to have a description. There's all the Pins that you've noticed that got clicks on both accounts. They all had a really good title and a really good description. Do not miss out on that. You could really be missing out on opportunities to tell Pinterest what your Pin is about and work on that Pinterest SEO. So, again, all these clicks and things like that that come to this account are all Pinterest SEO. So, obviously, all these pins and so much more that come from it are not for my followers, because I have a very small following, but it's from Pinterest SEO. So, people who look those things up and found me in search. And then something else that I really noticed for this blog is that a lot of designs are different. So, I work with about four or five different designs for this blog that I kind of reuse. And a lot of the ones that are top there just seems to be different ones. It's not necessarily one design that does really well.\
\
[00:16:21.610] - Ana\
It's more topic-focused. So, it's about the actual topic and how well a job I do. But I would definitely pay the attention to the top Pins that you have there and the ones that are converting really well. Like this one converted at 5%. Again, really, really good. And it's because the text on it is really, really specific. And then the image draws attention. And you can see here that the dog is looking up at the text. So, use your images in a way that it draws attention to the content itself. Like I said, with arrows, with people looking in a specific direction, it really draws people's eyes in a busy feed to that. And again, work on your title. Work on those differences. So, new pull harnesses, pull harnesses for bulldogs, for French bulldogs, make sure to improve your actual title because you have more space there than on the actual Pin and save it to a relevant board. So, like pet product reviews, right? And then something else that you can look at just to see how they're performing is your boards as well. So, pay attention to the boards that are doing quite well impression wise, or even the ones that are getting the most clicks.\
\
[00:17:30.730] - Ana\
Again, this would be different. And you kind of can keep scrolling. And make sure to add more Pins to those boards. Those are boards who are already performing for you, so add more Pins to it. It's really that simple. It's really about distributing your Pins to the right places, so that Pinterest distribute them further than your own following. And then really quick, I'm going to show you the second place where you can go to check out your traffic from Pinterest in really, really specific terms. So, this is using the Google Analytics data on your blog. So, you want to go to Acquisition, overview, social, and network referrals. When you go here, you just want to go to Pinterest, which you can see is my top referring social account. And then you see exactly which posts are getting traffic from Pinterest. So, let's say, for example, my $50,000 income report. And once you click on it, it will tell you where the traffic is coming from. And when it just says Pinterest, Pinterest, Pinterest, it means they couldn't track exactly the design or it came from like mobile traffic, which they can really track. This really shows me, because I saw this trend a lot, is that a lot of my audience is using Pinterest on their phone.\
\
[00:18:41.690] - Ana\
That's how they're getting to my website. That's how they're finding my Pins. So, really, really make sure that your Pins designs do stand out in mobile feed as well. So, look through the Pinterest app on your phone to see what works and what doesn't. But you'll notice that a couple of the Pins here have like longer numbers. And these are the actual Pins that are driving traffic. So, when you get here, if you want to see the Pin design, all you have to do is just copy it, open a new tab, paste it in there and this is the Pin that performed, right. Again, we can see a couple of comments in there. So, there's engagement. I have the Amazon banner right there which draws people's attention since this is an Amazon affiliate tutorial. And this was even saved to something called Amazon marketing. This goes to show that no matter what we try to do with our own accounts is a Pinterest community that dictates which Pins perform well or not. So, other people adding your Pins to relevant boards is such a vital thing for your Pin and obviously, you can't always be in control of it.\
\
[00:19:44.570] - Ana\
But if you have tailwind, as you can see, I have the tailwind publisher. They do have tailwind communities that are very niche specific. So, I'm in a lot of blogging one or pet ones for my pet blog and we kind of share each other's Pins. But the ones in the pet communities are obviously pet bloggers. So, they add my Pins to really relevant boards. And that really makes a difference, especially when you have like a newer account. And you can kind of go back on here and look through your other Pins and try to find the Pin designs that are really performing. So, this is the same thing. Find these little Pin numbers and they all will be usually for different Pins. Paste it in and then you'll see the ones that are performing quite well. So, again, this is an older one that seems to be driving some traffic. Keep at it, really try to improve your Pinterest account per se, and then take into account these different Pin designs that do work for you. You'll be able to kind of see a couple added lands. And what I try to do as well with my Pins is just keep them similar, a little different, but quite similar in how they look, just so that the branding is a little consistent and people know it's my blog.\
\
[00:20:54.650] - Ana\
So, you'll see a lot of this blue that I have in my logo and things like that, kind of show up in different places, and then you can really grow your monthly views. But I know there are people who have way more monthly views who are not really getting the traffic back to their website from that. So, don't get hung up on that and really try to learn from your own experiences and your own analytics.\
\
[00:21:18.300] - Ana\
And that was it. Those were my Pins that I did really well for me in the past or that are doing well now. Keep in mind that even Pins with really high click-through rates go through periods of time of not seeing that traffic immediately. So, don't get discouraged. A lot of these Pins didn't start picking up that traffic until Pinterest started to distribute them accordingly. But there's only so much you can do with the numbers that you have. So that's why I look at the click-through rate and I see the traffic that I get from those pins in correlation to the impressions rather than always comparing them to each other. Because you can have pins that have a much higher click through rate, but because they're not getting distributed as much on pinterest, it looks like they're bad pins. And that's also not the case. Keep in mind that Pinterest is definitely a long term game. You might have noticed that a lot of these pins were from the past years, where I actually published for the first time, and it takes a little bit for them to gain traction. So, one of the most important things that I would have to advise you on is definitely have patience with it.\
\
[00:22:17.690] - Ana\
Do check on your analytics often enough to see any spikes in traffic that you might have missed, but have patience with them. And don't give up on pin designs or on these Pinterest treks until you've actually given them time to both implement them and experiment with them. And let Pinterest kind of index the new pins that you have. If there's one thing that I noticed with these pins and most of my pins that end up bringing traffic is that none of them did really well in the first few months. So, definitely don't get discouraged by that and really trust the process and focus on the Pinterest SEO in the background. I know my presentation was a lot about the pin design and what you should have in there, and bits and pieces of it do have to do with the SEO, both the visual SEO of Pinterest, because Pinterest is a very visual platform. And the actual words you write out on those pins do matter, both for the click-through rate and for Pinterest to index a pin and categorize it accordingly. But the things that you add on top of that when you publish a pin also really matter.\
\
[00:23:21.340] - Ana\
I'm talking about your title, your descriptions, and the boards that it ends up living in. That's still so important. And I don't want to stray away from the topic of my presentation for too long, but if you already are a master of pin designs and you wanted to look deeply into my pins are doing great, how can I make them do even better? I would then look at your Pinterest SEO. That being said, I'll share a couple of really, really quick tips on how to do that. Number one, be super mindful of the boards that you add the pin to. The first board matters the most. So, the first time an image hits Pinterest, they look at where you add it first, especially if you own the domain where that pin is linked to. Right? Because if you claim your website, you own that domain. They trust you to tell them where those pins should live and where they should be categorized. So, the board that you pin an image to the first time, it's so important and it really embeds that Pin in all the information around it. So, from your board title, description, and other pins that live in that pin, they all matter and they all give their information back to the main Pin that you add in there.\
\
[00:24:31.270] - Ana\
To simplify this, if you have a Pin about Christmas recipes and then you add a Thanksgiving recipe in there, Pinterest is going to be confused, right? They're going to categorize that pin as a Christmas recipe rather than a Thanksgiving recipe, which may cause you to miss out on being ranked for that as well. Now, that being said, you can add a Pin to multiple boards that are relevant. So, if it happens to be a chicken roast recipe and you add it to all these different recipes, it can gain information from all these different boards as a potential to rank for it. That's not a problem, but the main one should be your priority. So, what are you trying to rank for, first and foremost? And make sure to add it to boards that line up with that first. What I'm saying is that at the end of the day, the Pinterest algorithm is an algorithm, right? They can only take the information you give them about a Pin and they take that from the end article as well. So the article you could link to, but also the added information you add to it, such as the Pin title and the description.\
\
[00:25:26.810] - Ana\
So use those places wisely, especially when you're trying to add new keywords in there. And of course, the most important takeaway that I hope you also got from today's presentation is to experiment with the Pin designs. Create multiple pins for the same blog post, article, or end page where you want to draw users to, different things work for different people, they might be distributed differently, and also you might never know what gets people to click. So, experiment with that. Go back through the things that we talked on today's presentation about those really high click-worthy pins, and hopefully, you'll be able to replicate that success moving forward on your own Pinterest account.\
\
[00:26:05.730] - Ana\
If that's the case, definitely reach out and tell me. I would love to see that for you guys and you can find me on my YouTube channel, on my blog, She Approach, and all social media related to that. So, reach out to me and I would love to celebrate with you on your Pinterest success. See you soon and I hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.730] - Speaker 1\
Welcome to this presentation all about how to spend less than 3 hours per month on your Pinterest strategy for your blog. Yes, you heard that right. I'm going to be teaching you all about Pinterest marketing, but I'm going to teach you the easy way. No strategies that take hours and hours. I'm going to teach you how to get from point A to point B as quicquicklyquicquicklyklyPintokly as possible when it comes to Pinterest.\
\
[00:00:36.780] - Speaker 1\
SoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoSoS are we ready? Let's get started. First of all, you might be like, who is this chick teaching you about Pinterest? Well, my name is Anita, and I have been a blogger for ten-plus years now. I have two travel blogs and I'm originally from New Zealand, but I currently live in a very small country called Albania, which is right next to Greece.\
\
[00:00:57.120] - Speaker 1\
It's very beautiful, by the way, as well as travel blogging. I also coach bloggers and online business owners on how to use blogs and Pinterest account to grow their business or their blog. I love Pinterest. I am so obsessed with it, and I'm really excited to teach you all about it. So how do you feel about Pinterest at the moment?\
\
[00:01:23.780] - Speaker 1\
I want your honest thoughts. Okay. How do you really feel about the platform? Do you feel excited to use Pinterest? Do you feel really happy about the platform?\
\
[00:01:34.210] - Speaker 1\
Do you love Pinterest? Do you love Pinterest? Are you confused? Are you overwhelmed? Are you fed up?\
\
[00:01:41.220] - Speaker 1\
I want you to be really honest with me. I want you to pop in the chat. How do you feel about Centrist currently? And the reason why I want you to do this is I want you to get it all out. Okay.\
\
[00:01:53.080] - Speaker 1\
I want you to tell me how you feel about this platform because I want all the negative talk, all the negative interest things that you may have heard in the Facebook groups. I've seen them. I'm part of the blogging Facebook group. I know what kind of goes around, but I want to leave all of that negativity right now. Okay.\
\
[00:02:12.650] - Speaker 1\
I want you to leave it at the door. Forget any negative comments and complaints you've heard about the platform. Maybe you've seen comments like Pinterest doesn't work for bloggers anymore. That is complete. B.\
\
[00:02:23.840] - Speaker 1\
Yes. By the way, I want this to be a fresh start and a new opportunity for you to get in front of your ideal audience. Pinterest is an incredible and very powerful platform that bloggers like me still use every day and see fantastic results. So leave all the negative Pinterest talk at the store and let's get into this presentation. So here's what you're going to learn today.\
\
[00:02:49.840] - Speaker 1\
I am all about taking action, by the way. Okay, so make sure that you have your notebook and you have your Pin to take lots of notes because I have so much that I want to share with you today and I think you're really going to love what I'm going to be teaching you. So the first thing we're going to go through is the two important steps to do before you put your Pinterest marketing strategy into place. Okay. There are two very important steps that you need to do.\
\
[00:03:15.670] - Speaker 1\
And if you do not do these, you're going to be wasting time creating content, putting it out there,\
\
[00:03:20.470] \
and seeing no traction. Okay. The second thing that you're going to be learning is my secret to spending less than 3 hours per month on Pinterest. It is totally entirely possible if you know how to do it, right. And the third thing that I'm going to be teaching you is how to automate so that you can spend more time on other areas of your blogging business.\
\
[00:03:43.640] - Speaker 1\
We know, as bloggers, we have, like, a thousand things that we need to do, right? We have so many different hats that we are wearing, and I'm going to teach you a little bit about automation and how it can actually really help your blogging business. Are you ready? I want you to pop in the live chat if you are ready for this presentation. If you're ready to learn about Pinterest and learn about this strategy so that you can spend less time on Pinterest and have that running in the background while you do all of the other amazing things that your floor brings in.\
\
[00:04:15.300] - Speaker 1\
Are we ready? Yes. Okay. So the first thing that I want you to take note of in order to see results on Pinterest, you need a combination of two things. So the first thing is SEO.\
\
[00:04:29.000] - Speaker 1\
Now, SEO stands for search engine optimization. If you don't know, the SEO actually gets your pens out in front of your ideal Pin is in the first place. So it is really important. And then the second part of this is your pins need to inspire the Pinner to take action. So the actual look of your pins, the call to action.\
\
[00:04:50.660] - Speaker 1\
They need to inspire the Pinner to take action, to read your blog post, to download your freebie, right. It needs to inspire. And we're going to be delving in a little bit about SEO because it is really important. But why is it important? Because Pinterest is a visual search engine?\
\
[00:05:09.150] - Speaker 1\
It's not a social media platform. Okay. When you go to Pinterest, you're not scrolling as you do on social media. You're not connecting with people. You're not being social like on social media.\
\
[00:05:20.620] - Speaker 1\
Pinterest is a search engine. Okay. And Pinterest is there to inspire and give ideas to Pinnace. So this could be like, what's the next DIY project that they need to do? Right?\
\
[00:05:32.380] - Speaker 1\
What to Cook for dinner? Inspire them with recipes that they should be cooking for dinner. What to wear this summer? Where to travel to next year? How to organize their lives.\
\
[00:05:43.600] - Speaker 1\
Right. And Pinners are not typing into Pinterest specific questions like you would on Google. So it is really important to know the user intent of the platform before you put out your strategy. So when you're thinking about Google and Pinterest, they are both search engines, but they do work a little bit differently, and the user intent is different. Okay.\
\
[00:06:05.490] - Speaker 1\
We don't go into Pinterest typing in how do I get from here to here or how do I do this without blah, blah blah. Usually Pinterest, we're typing in no less words, maybe like dinner recipes or summer dinner recipes. And we're looking for inspiration from there. So there are two important steps you need to do before getting into your marketing strategy, and those are set up and SEO. Okay, so before we get creating content, or if you are already on Pinterest and you're creating content, just pause for a second and make sure that you have all of this done first.\
\
[00:06:44.020] - Speaker 1\
Okay. So the setup part of it is you need to have your website claim, make sure that you do that. It's pretty easy and takes around five to ten minutes. You can go into settings and you'll go and add your website and you'll have to add a little code and it's really easy to do. And it just gives you pretty clear instructions on how to do that.\
\
[00:07:02.370] - Speaker 1\
The second thing you need to make sure is that you have a business account. So if you do have a personal business account, a personal visit. If you have a personal Pinterest account, you need to convert that and you can do that in the settings. If you haven't signed up for Pinterest yet, then you can create a business account from the get-go. And once we have that, we get access to some incredible analytics.\
\
[00:07:23.970] - Speaker 1\
Okay. And then the second part of this is search engine optimization. So before we get into posting content, you need to make sure that your profile is optimized. Yes, you can optimize your profile, not just your pen. So you need to make sure that in the name of your Pinterest profile, you have your blog, and you also have one to two keywords for your niche and your title.\
\
[00:07:50.530] - Speaker 1\
The second part of this is your profile description. This should be really clear on who you help and what you help them with and make sure that you include some keywords in there, too. And this is going to help your profile to be more visible. And then the third part of this is making sure that you have relevant boards set up. So I would recommend if you're just getting started a minimum of eight to ten boards on your Pinterest account.\
\
[00:08:16.650] - Speaker 1\
If you are already on Pinterest and you have been for a while and you have more boards, then that's great. But make sure that they are relevant. And the title of the boards is search terms that your ideal Pin is typing into Pinterest. Okay. And then another step to that is making sure that all your boards have descriptions I promise you.\
\
[00:08:40.030] - Speaker 1\
So those are the two steps that you need to make sure that you have done before you go creating content and publishing it set up and SEO. So I want you to take action on this. Your action step is to set up and optimize your own profile. So take some time to do this one-off task and get it done. All right.\
\
[00:09:02.340] - Speaker 1\
This is not a task that you have to do every week you don't want and you have it done. Okay. So I want you to pop in the chat. I want you to pop. Yes.\
\
[00:09:11.040] - Speaker 1\
If you can commit to doing this within the next week or two and put the time in your calendar to do this because this is really important. All right, so let's get onto how the secret on how I spend less than 3 hours per month on Pinterest. So there are three kinds of pointers that I want to talk about. The first is batching. So I'm going to go deeper into this in a second.\
\
[00:09:36.800] - Speaker 1\
But batching is when you allocate time periods where you do one task only. Okay. And when you get into a rhythm of doing that one task, you actually get it done ten times faster. Now, the second point that I want to say is done over perfect. All right, so stop obsessing that your pin has to be perfect.\
\
[00:09:57.920] - Speaker 1\
Get it done. All right, set a timer for yourself. I love to put a time on for five or ten minutes, and after that, I have to have my pen down any more time than that, I'm obsessing over the details. That probably doesn't even matter. Okay, so just get it done over perfect.\
\
[00:10:14.350] - Speaker 1\
And then the third thing is to make sure that you have some systems in place. So this could be like templates. This could be repurposing your Pin description and knowing what content does best for your account. So you're not wondering what kind of content should I put out. You should already know that.\
\
[00:10:31.470] - Speaker 1\
Okay. And there's no need to reinvent the wheel, do more of what's working. So lean into what content is doing really well on Pinterest for your niche. Okay. And just a side note, I'm going to be giving you some templates at the end, so stick around.\
\
[00:10:47.770] - Speaker 1\
Let's talk a little bit more about batching. So with batching, before you set up your batching schedule, you need to write out all of the tasks that you do. Okay. So with Pinterest, there are maybe around six tasks that I've put down here. So we have research.\
\
[00:11:02.880] - Speaker 1\
We have the creation of the pins, the creation of the Pin title, and descriptions. We have scheduling or publishing. We have tracking, and we have account updates. So those are all the kinds of tasks that we do when it comes to Pinterest. Now, I want you to split those tasks up.\
\
[00:11:19.600] - Speaker 1\
There are two kinds of tasks in there. There are the creation tasks, which actually, you need a lot of focus for. Okay. We cannot be creating maybe titles or descriptions and things like that with Netflix in the background. Okay.\
\
[00:11:35.120] - Speaker 1\
But admin tasks don't need our 100% focus. We can kind of do this, like in the background, the creation. You do need a lot of motivation and downtime to be in that creation phase. So split those tasks up. And maybe you decide that all the creative tasks for Pinterest, you'll do every second Monday, and maybe the admin tasks you'll do once a month on the last day of the month or something like that.\
\
[00:12:02.390] - Speaker 1\
Okay. And you can kind of split your time up there. So you can say I'm going to spend only 1 hour on admin tasks, and then creation tasks usually take a little bit of more time. So I'm going to spend 2 hours per month. And maybe you'll split those 2 hours, like 1 hour every two weeks you'll do for creation parts or whatever that looks like for you.\
\
[00:12:23.000] - Speaker 1\
You can split it up that way. So I want you to take action on this. I want you to commit to putting in the time in your calendar for Pinterest, and you can create a batch and schedule for yourself. You can see an example here of one of my clients, her monthly schedule. So week one, the first week of the month, she would do just creation tasks.\
\
[00:12:47.260] - Speaker 1\
So she would be creating pins and things like that. And she put 45 minutes. And then week two, she was doing admin tasks. She put 1 hour for that. And then week three was creation again.\
\
[00:12:59.040] - Speaker 1\
So you can split up your time similar to this. But I want you to commit to doing this. Okay. It's all well and good me teaching you about batching, but if you don't put it into practice, you're not going to do it. Okay.\
\
[00:13:11.090] - Speaker 1\
So copy. Yes. In the chat. If you can commit to me today that you will put this time into Pinterest. Okay.\
\
[00:13:19.690] - Speaker 1\
All right. So the third step that I want to talk about is automation. Automation is incredible. So your time is better than elsewhere for certain tasks. Okay.\
\
[00:13:34.200] - Speaker 1\
Automate the tasks that you don't have to do. There are computers for that. There are automations for that so that you can spend more time focusing on other tasks that push your blog forward. All right. So as a Pinterest coach, I would recommend that for my clients to post ten, two to five times per day.\
\
[00:13:56.260] - Speaker 1\
So I want you to be really real with me in the chat right now. Can you show up on Pinterest that many times a day to live, publish every single day consistently, and not get burnt out? This is where I see a lot of bloggers go wrong is that you're getting burnt out with Pinterest. And the thing with Pinterest is that you need to take, you know, it can take at least three months to see results. So why not automate a part of Pinterest that can actually save you time so that you can show up consistently.\
\
[00:14:33.910] - Speaker 1\
So my recommendation is to use an approved scheduler. This is one way that we can automate our Pinterest marketing strategy. So Pinterest is not trying to make things harder for you. My recommendation for a schedule is Tailwind. I have used Kwan for years and years and years now and I do have a $30 credit in case you want to try it out and see how you like it.\
\
[00:14:56.290] - Speaker 1\
But there is another bunch of schedulers out there that are approved with central as well. If you don't like tailwind or if you try that and you're not working on it, there is Canva you can schedule pins for Canva later plan a loyal, and then also Pinterest has a scheduler for themselves. It is very basic, so I don't necessarily recommend it, but if you do want something basic to help you out and is free, then you can try the Pinterest one. Okay. I just recommend Tailwind because I personally use it, and there are some other features within Tailwind like you can go deeper into analytics into your boards and things like that, and it's a really easy way to schedule content.\
\
[00:15:39.950] - Speaker 1\
So that would be my recommendation. The reason why it's really important to automate is that you need to be consistent with Pinterest. It is a platform where you do need to show up every day consistently to see results. It's not a platform where you can put out five pins and then forget for a couple of weeks and then post another ten pins and then wonder why it's not working out. It's because you're not being consistent.\
\
[00:16:08.870] - Speaker 1\
So Pinterest is not a quick fix because it's not a social media platform, right? We don't put out content and we get results straight away as we might with social media. With Pinterest, you need to be patient. And the return on investment with Pinterest is much, much higher than social media because when we put out a Pin, it's circulating for years and years and years. Okay, so that Pin might not gain traction for a few months or a year.\
\
[00:16:37.810] - Speaker 1\
Even I have a Pin, which I posted in 2015, which still brings me traffic to this day. So when you are implementing Pinterest for your blog, you need to be patient. Please, please be patient. Okay. And it's really important to test and analyze with Pinterest as well.\
\
[00:16:59.780] - Speaker 1\
You don't know what's doing well unless you're tracking and analyzing. So once you have done your setup, you've done your SEO and you're putting out content. Then I want you to lean in and what's working. Tip and analyze. Analyze the content that you put out and see what is doing really well for your Pinterest account for your topics, your niche.\
\
[00:17:22.100] - Speaker 1\
So once you've been on Pinterest and you have been posting for three months consistently every day two to five times per day. Then look at your top five to ten pens and answer these questions. What do these pins look like? And are there any consistencies in your pens that look very similar? Do your top pins look very similar in the way that they've laid out all the pictures, the types of pictures, the colors?\
\
[00:17:49.850] - Speaker 1\
What keywords are you using for those pins? Are they regular pins or video pins? So for me, my Pinterest account, video pins do much better than standard pens because they catch the eye more of the pen up. And then also, what's the topic of the pen? So you may find that certain topics do much better than others.\
\
[00:18:09.640] - Speaker 1\
For example, when I was analyzing my account, I found out that my London content does incredibly well. So from there, I put out more London content because that's what's working. Do more of what's working. Okay, so your third and final action step is to start scheduling pins. Okay, try out a scheduler and get familiar with it.\
\
[00:18:36.320] - Speaker 1\
Remember, there is Tailwind, Canva, Planoly, there's Later or you can try out Pinterest itself. Okay. It will honestly make your Pinterest marketing strategy 1000 times easier. And it'll make your blog more scalable because you'll be able to spend more time doing other things in your blogging business, like pitching to brands or writing articles, doing that sort of thing. Leave Pinterest to do its thing in the background.\
\
[00:19:04.690] - Speaker 1\
That's what it's good for. Okay, so let's go through these three action sets that I have given you today. Make sure you write this down and make sure that you do that. Okay. Because again, I can teach you all of the strategies in the world, but the only thing that is actually going to help you and get you success on Pinterest is taking action.\
\
[00:19:25.870] - Speaker 1\
So the first action step is to set up and optimize your profile. Okay. The second step is to create a batch and workflow that works for you and make the commitment to stick to it. So put it in your calendar, make sure that you do stick to it. And then the third thing is to start to use a scheduler, right?\
\
[00:19:48.600] - Speaker 1\
Experiment. See how you like it. Check out a different scheduler, make sure that you use a tool like a scheduler to help you stay consistent with Pinterest. And I know consistency. Such a hard word to say is not something that is like, overly sexy or anything like that.\
\
[00:20:11.420] - Speaker 1\
But it is so, so important with Pinterest, with any type of platform, with social media, with your blog. Consistency is so important and uses automation to help you with that. Okay. All right. So if you have a Pinterest question, I want you to pop in the chat right now if you have a question about Pinterest, if you have a question about anything that I have talked about in this presentation, I want you to leave it in the chat because I am in there right now answering your questions.\
\
[00:20:44.370] - Speaker 1\
Okay. And I know with Pinterest, there is a lot of different questions that you may have. Pinterest is a changing platform. It changes so much these days. We have so many new updates as well.\
\
[00:20:57.280] - Speaker 1\
So maybe you have some questions that you are dying to know, and I want you to go ask them because this is what I'm here for. I'm here to answer your questions in the chat. Okay. And I have a special gift for you today. So to save time and how to get started with Pinterest, I have created a free Pinterest blogger bundle that you are welcome to go get right now.\
\
[00:21:23.570] - Speaker 1\
So within this bundle, you get my six-step roadmap to get your blog on Pinterest. So if you're at the very beginning stage, then this roadmap is really going to help you, even if you are not on the beginner stage. If you're not sure if you have everything set up correctly, then this roadmap is going to make sure that you have everything done and dusted before you go and create content. Okay. So it's a really helpful step-by-step roadmap to help you get started on Pinterest and get that set up and SEO is done.\
\
[00:21:56.750] - Speaker 1\
And then the second thing you get within this bundle is my five free Pinterest templates. Again, I want to show you that Pinterest doesn't have to take a lot of time. Use these Pinterest templates and create content faster. And then the third thing is my Pin description formula that allows you to create them quickly. So Pin descriptions can sometimes be kind of a scary thing because we think alike, we need to write these things and they can belong and they can take time.\
\
[00:22:27.720] - Speaker 1\
I'm going to show you my three-step formula to actually create those faster. They don't have to be that difficult. Okay. And I'm going to show you how to create them so that they actually convert Pinners to your blog post or to your email list. Whatever you're using Pinterest for, I show you how to create those optimized pen descriptions for your pen, and then a little bonus as well.\
\
[00:22:51.690] - Speaker 1\
I have tracked in $30 Tailwind credit. So if you did want to try out a scheduler, but you're not sure if Tailwind is the right one, then use the credit. Try it out. If you like it, continue. If you don't, then use another one.\
\
[00:23:05.420] - Speaker 1\
Okay. But it's there for you to have. So if you want to get this Blogger bundle, then all you have to do is you have to click the button below to get that you'll be sent to a signup page. You just have to put your name and your email, and then I will send it out to your email and you'll get that Blogger bundle within minutes. Okay.\
\
[00:23:27.360] - Speaker 1\
And this blogger bundle is there for you to save time on Pinterest, and it's going to be really really helpful for your Pinterest marketing strategy. So I'm so thankful that you have joined me for this presentation today. I hope that you have learned something. Remember, if you have any questions to pop it in the live chat because I'm here right now answering your questions, I hope you have enjoyed it. And I will speak to you soon.\
\
[00:23:53.550] - Speaker 1\
Bye, everyone.\

Well, thank you for having me. I love to talk about Pinterest. I know this past year has been kind of volatile and frustrating on Pinterest for a lot of people. It has not dampened my love of the platform at all. I am still just as fascinated by it as I've always been. One of the things that I've found really essential this year is going back to the basics of what makes Pinterest, what Pinterest is, and not for bloggers, for the end-user.So, yeah, so that's something that we miss a lot as bloggers. We get so in our heads, we hear something, we think that's the thing and we stick to that thing, whatever it is.\
\
[00:01:14.790] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:01:15.120] - Carly\
Good advice, or bad advice.\
\
[00:01:15.912] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:01:15.930] - Carly\
But, we forget that the end-user is the one who makes the rules really.\
\
[00:01:20.940] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. For Pinterest, for Seo, for Google.\
\
[00:01:26.250] - Carly\
For everything!\
\
[00:01:26.300] - Liz\
We talked about, Grayson and I, go look at your site, like, signed out every now and then. You'll notice if something's broken. Like, go to an incognito window and see what your site looks like to someone who is visiting it for the first time.\
\
[00:01:42.360] - Carly\
Yes! Yeah, it is crazy. You know, we weren't going to talk about this, but this has brought this up. You know, I'm actually doing an experiment right now. I'm trying to determine if, average time on page from Pinterest is actually affecting traffic right now, and I believe it is.\
\
[00:02:00.270] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:02:00.390] - Carly\
Which means as an end-user, if you don't often visit your page from, especially from your cell phone, and if you don't realize that your cookie notice and your popup video from your ad company...\
\
[00:02:14.640] - Liz\
Completely blocks everything.\
\
[00:02:14.690] - Carly\
Like if you're attacking your user within the first 30 seconds of getting to your page, I believe that is...\
\
[00:02:23.760] - Liz\
If you have to exit out of all the things to get to the content you leave.\
\
[00:02:26.000] - Carly\
Yep! They're just leaving. They're just going back to Pinterest. They weren't there looking for you in the first place. They were there looking on Pinterest and they're just going to go back to Pinterest and look for the next closest thing. So I believe that the end-user experience on your site is huge for your long term Pinterest traffic.\
\
[00:02:43.320] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:02:44.070] - Carly\
It's not going to do anything for your short-term Pinterest traffic, which means, like, if I publish a Pin today, that Pin might still get into the feed. That's fine. I'm talking about what's happening on your site in a year or so. So that's a great, great thing to do, no matter what you're working on. Look at your site.\
\
[00:02:57.720] - Liz\
Yes. So always think about your reader first, like not just the coolest, hippest strategy chasing those squirrels or whatever, but user experience. So we're actually today talking about clickable vs. Saveable content we'll actually get on to the topic we said we were going to do.\
\
[00:03:16.860] - Carly\
Well, I was going to say from the end user perspective, that's the user who's deciding whether or not your content is clickable or saveable on the platform. And before we talk about clickable vs. saveable, we kind of have to understand and clickable and saveable mean inside of Pinterest.\
\
[00:03:32.430] - Liz\
Yes. \
\
[00:03:33.600] - Carly\
So clickable is the kind of Pin where somebody is going to click through the Pin and go to your site. Saveable is a kind of, and I'm talking about the idea of, not the actual function of the Pin, which we will talk about.\
\
[00:03:48.300] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:03:49.200] - Carly\
But is the idea of the Pin, an idea that somebody is going to say, I'm going to save this picture, this image for the information on the Pin so I can refer to the information on the Pin later.\
\
[00:04:05.850] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:04:06.340] - Carly\
Or are they saving it, thinking to themselves, I'm going to refer to the information behind this Pin later.\
\
[00:04:13.170] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:04:14.040] - Carly\
So a really good example is an infographic versus a informational article. So you'll save an infographic for the information on the pin.\
\
[00:04:25.110] - Liz\
Probably not clicking to the content though.\
\
[00:04:27.900] - Carly\
You're probably not. You're right, all the information is right there on the pin.\
\
[00:04:31.780] - Liz\
The other example I always think of are quotes.\
\
[00:04:34.500] - Carly\
Yes.\
\
[00:04:35.070] - Liz\
They're like, I do a ton of quotes. I get all sorts of saves and no clicks. And you're like, well, why would they click through.\
\
[00:04:39.570] - Carly\
Yes, yes. No, totally. And I read the other day that, and I might get this wrong, but I think it was 30 million people per day save quotes on Pinterest. Pinterest was the one pushing that stat out as an amazing stat. And I'm like, "That's great for you, Pinterest. That's not so good for me."\
\
[00:05:01.980] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:05:02.700] - Carly\
Saveable content is good for Pinterest, clickable content is good for you.\
\
[00:05:10.590] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:05:10.980] - Carly\
And you have to remember that there is a difference.\
\
[00:05:13.710] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:05:14.790] - Carly\
So saveable content will not hurt your account, like putting out quotes, putting out infographics, putting out instructional videos where people watch the video, just see the process. That will not hurt your account because they will get distributed through the platform. People will save them. That's fine. They're not going to help you as a blogger. Clickable content, on the other hand, is content that requires the person to click through to the other side to really get what they're after.This would be like a informational article where you have a really good title that inspires a click. You can have an informational title with a terrible, terrible title that doesn't inspire a click.\
\
[00:06:09.900] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:06:13.000] - Carly\
Instructional content where in the last few steps go like it's fine to do an instructional video, show the first few frames of you doing something, show the last frame of the completed product project, don't show them they're really important part at the end, and then on your last frame, you can put "Click for instructions" or "Click for complete instructions."\
\
[00:06:37.520] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:06:38.680] - Carly\
You want to encourage that click. However, with the end-user in mind, I've been finding lately that sometimes as bloggers, as Pinterest experts, we always say don't bother pinning Pins without text on it, because the text is encouraging to the quicker.\
\
[00:06:59.740] - Liz\
It's a call to action.\
\
[00:07:01.180] - Carly\
Yeah. However, we've been finding that sometimes the title can be all that is required. That little title underneath the Pin can be all is required to encourage a click when the image checks the right boxes.So for example, a a finished craft project with no text over it.\
\
[00:07:30.380] - Liz\
Yeah. \
\
[00:07:31.480] - Carly\
but in your title underneath it says - complete tutorial for this thing, the picture is of.\
\
[00:07:37.270] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:07:38.140] - Carly\
Yeah. So because the title appears underneath the Pin, if you are taking advantage of that title, those plain images can be both saveable and clickable.\
\
[00:07:50.950] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:07:51.700] - Carly\
And that is the winning combination on Pinterest.\
\
[00:07:55.600] - Liz\
Yeah, I see that with, one of my clients is a food blogger and so comparing it with the title on the pin versus just the image of the food because she has gorgeous photography, you know, like she's it's, it's different results in terms of saving versus clicking, but it does bring in traffic, too.\
\
[00:08:17.140] - Liz\
So it's kind of it's interesting to look at that. I've been experimenting with that as well.\
\
[00:08:21.850] - Carly\
Good. That's exciting to hear because the thing about clicks and saves, and we actually had somebody bring this up in my mastermind group the other day, she had this beautiful Pin with thousands of clicks and she said, I feel frustrated that Pinterest, isn't giving this Pin more feed time. Everybody is clicking it. But the fact of the matter is, Pinterest has told us in their algorithm, saves are greater clicks, which means a Pin with more saves will get more distribution than a Pin with more clicks.\
\
[00:08:55.060] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:08:55.720] - Carly\
So if you can utilize those beautiful no text images to get the save, they'll get the clicks by default because that's what's out there.\
\
[00:09:05.460] - Carly\
That's what's getting feed time. Yeah. So sure, the one with the text on it might outperform if it was getting the same feed time, but it might not get the same feed time because saves are greater than clicks.\
\
[00:09:17.320] - Liz\
Got it, Yeah.\
\
[00:09:18.730] - Carly\
So we can we can hopefully we can expand this idea, this makes sense so far, right?\
\
[00:09:26.020] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah. No it does. Yeah.\
\
[00:09:29.320] - Carly\
So hopefully we can expand this idea of capitalizing on clickable content to generate saves by applying the same principles to quote Pin or infographics Pins if we think about the end user and what they might be looking for when they see that, quote Pin or that or that Infographic Pin, what might the title be underneath that Pin that would encourage them to click over?\
\
[00:09:58.670] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:09:59.190] - Carly\
So that might take some out-of-the-box thinking.\
\
[00:10:03.230] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:04.100] - Carly\
But if you're so, for example, in my niche, which is momming, if I was thinking about a really a quote about parenting.\
\
[00:10:16.130] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:17.390] - Carly\
What user is this quote speaking to and what's her problem today.\
\
[00:10:25.100] - Carly\
And the title under that Pin is more information, that user might click on that quote anyway, just based on the title underneath.\
\
[00:10:32.990] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:33.740] - Carly\
So it's really essential that we start experimenting with different titles and thinking about how our title alone can generate the click and include a non text image. Whenever you can, just to see.\
\
[00:10:50.600] - Carly\
Is that the one that some...\
\
[00:10:51.470] - Liz\
And those are easier to make because they you don't have to mess around with the text.\
\
[00:10:56.090] - Carly\
Yeah, absolutely. Particularly those are particularly easy for food or DIY.\
\
[00:11:02.930] - Liz\
Yeah, we're getting a little more thinking. Like I can see another client of mine is in the fitness space. And so, you know, people are like, look for fitness, motivation quotes or something, you know, so you could do like a quote.\
\
[00:10:50.600] - Liz\
And the title could be like how to get motivated even when you're not a morning person to run or something like so it actually feeds into what they were looking for, but also gets that save.\
\
[00:11:28.070] - Carly\
Yes. Yes. What is the end user looking for? That is that's absolutely, the most important thing. So speaking of the end users and saves are greater than clicks and all this stuff, Pinterest has recently rolled out story Pins. Story Pins.\
\
[00:11:48.310] - Liz\
They sure have.\
\
[00:11:48.480] - Carly\
I just hate them, so, so the problem with story Pins and the problem is, is actually huge. And I don't know how many people realize how huge the problem is, but story Pins get a lot of impressions really fast.\
\
[00:12:03.710] - Carly\
So bloggers like them and they, they want to make them it's nice to get all those impressions. You cannot put a link in a story Pin. So a story Pin by default is never clickable. Even if you make the most clickable image ever. It's never clickable, ever. It's automatically only saveable. And we know that saves are greater than clicks. So we know that over time, as people save story Pins, I believe that our story Pins will naturally, algorithmically suppress our regular Pins because everybody's home feed or following feed or to any feed that you have on Pinterest, you automatically set to a certain percentage story and video Pins, right away out of the gate when we interact with a story or video Pin, which includes saving it or clicking on it or liking it or whatever.\
\
[00:13:03.450] - Carly\
The percentage of our feed that is that a story Pins or video Pins increases. That's what Pinterest is designed to do, they've intereacted with this, they like it. They want more of it. They give them more of it.\
\
[00:13:12.980] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:13:15.090] - Carly\
What's it taking the place of then? If they're putting more story Pins in the feed of the person that's interactived with they're taking the place of your regular Pins, the ones that have links.\
\
[00:13:26.410] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:13:27.240] - Carly\
Yeah. So they're absolutely going to suppress our regular Pins over time as people interact with them. So when we were considering saveable versus clickable content, and what is more important to us as bloggers, I implore you, do not make story Pins, you're ruining Pinterest.\
\
[00:13:43.350] - Carly\
Story Pins will be....\
\
[00:13:48.740] - Liz\
Hopefully, by the time this airs story Pins will go away.\
\
[00:13:51.150] - Carly\
Oh my goodness. Wouldn't that be amazing?\
\
[00:13:53.380] - Liz\
It will be like a t2021 gift for 2020 being so 2020.\
\
[00:14:00.240] - Carly\
I don't think that's going to happen yet, but the only way that it will happen is if we refuse to make them.\
\
[00:14:06.840] - Liz\
Because there's no benefit to content creators if people can't click to our content. So I do want to, because we're talking about stories Pins in particular you can do a link on video Pins and they do help get impressions. I haven't noticed tons of clicks. When I've done video Pin, I experimented with them. What are your feelings on sort of the animated Pins, which is technically a video Pin? But you know what I'm talking about how there's like you can animate in Canva and I'm assuming Picmonkey like a little. What are your feelings on those?\
\
[00:14:33.960] - Carly\
OK, so I just did my first three of those about three weeks ago and I am watching them to see what they do. Out of the gate, they got better impressions, like we know that, depending on the niche. I tried them in a number of different niches, depending on the niche people would react to them and that boosted them even further.\
\
[00:15:01.340] - Carly\
And the problem with them, I think, is that you still can't you can't click directly through them, so you have to click on them and scroll down to click on the link at the bottom, just like a video. Because to Pinterest, it's a video.\
\
[00:15:15.020] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:15:15.980] - Carly\
So I think that the problem with them is that they're not immediately clickable. What I haven't tried yet, but I think it would be amazing is promoting them because when you promote something, it's instantly clickable.\
\
[00:15:29.320] - Liz\
Yeah, right.\
\
[00:15:30.540] - Carly\
So I think that they do they do call attention to the user, that, they stand out in a way that's not the same as video. Like a person sees it right away and doesn't have to watch it for ten seconds. So you don't need to hold their attention. So I think that promoting them, might inspire good click through rate for that promoted Pin. But as far as just using them as an everyday Pin, I'm hesitant about them also, like they are being treated the same as video in the algorithm.\
\
[00:16:07.790] - Liz\
As far as Pinterest is concerned.\
\
[00:16:09.440] - Carly\
Yeah.\
\
[00:16:09.950] - Liz\
So not as much work as creating a video Pin in the way we would think about it, but. Yeah,\
\
[00:16:15.230] - Carly\
Right. But the work is. The amount of work is. I mean, if creating video Pins brought thousands and thousands of views to my site, I would do the work I would create the video Pins. Yeah, the thing is that I I've created these animated Pins and they both brought less than all three of them, brought less than 10 clicks, even though they got over 5000 impressions within a minute, they all got less than 10 clicks.\
\
[00:16:40.370] - Carly\
So. I still don't think that there is as much ROI there as there is in learning to create good Pins the garner both saves and clicks. Yeah, so I am, I am, I mean, I'll watch them. They're only three weeks old, maybe in 20 weeks they will do amazing things. But...\
\
[00:17:03.860] - Liz\
Yeah, and that's the thing is with Pinterest and I think a lot of people new to Pinterest lose sight of that is Pinterest is a long game. It's not as fast as it used to be anymore. It is more similar to doing like SEO type of work. You'd give it, I think, a minimum of three months being consistent and really six. And you're not going to be able to tell the first year, like, don't freak out over the the dips, you know, the peaks and valleys because every niche has them and you're learning what yours are.\
\
[00:17:34.540] - Carly\
Yeah. And on Pinterest are, sometimes I think that we almost invent dips, we think we're in a dip, but really what we're in is the downside of a peak. Because it's really easy to get a good bump on Pinterest. Then we think this is our new normal but normal is still down here. Yeah, we think our traffic's going down, it's not going down.\
\
[00:17:59.130] - Liz\
It's just leveling out.\
\
[00:18:01.920] - Carly\
Yeah, it's nice. Enjoy the, enjoy the peak, but get used to the baseline.\
\
[00:18:07.400] - Carly\
Yeah. And work to grow your baseline over time. Slowly with clickable and savable content.\
\
[00:18:13.130] - Liz\
And being consistent.\
\
[00:18:14.990] - Carly\
Consistency is really important. Yeah.\
\
[00:18:17.030] - Liz\
I feel like that. I mean that's true of every aspect of blogging I feel like.\
\
[00:18:21.260] - Carly\
Absolutely. And and I think too, some that has gotten kind of swept under the rug in the last couple of years of Pinterest traffic is, Be consistent with Pinterest but be consistent with your blog and content creation, because Pinterest wants more content. They like, yes,\
\
[00:18:42.470] - Liz\
At least they say they do. They're like we want more content. But do story Pins.\
\
[00:18:47.840] - Carly\
Yes, exactly. Create content on Pinterest for Pinterest. Don't do that. But they do want, for the past year and a half, it's been frustrating because I had so many people say "my new content doesn't get clicks, only my old content gets clicks."\
\
[00:19:04.730] - Carly\
And it makes us feel like we don't want to bother creating more content on the platform, but we know it. My top post on Pinterest right now are posts that I posted in, I want to say April and September of 2019, after posting each of them, I said my new content doesn't get any any traction on Pinterest, none.\
\
[00:19:25.610] - Liz\
The tractions is taking so much longer.\
\
[00:19:29.790] - Carly\
Yeah, it took eight months for that content to get traction. Now I will say the Pins for that post are hyper clickable, not saveable.\
\
[00:19:43.410] - Carly\
So the Pins when I put them out didn't get a ton of saves. And I think that if you can get a ton of saves on a Pin when you first get it out, that might gain traction a little faster.\
\
[00:19:56.940] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:19:58.100] - Carly\
You don't need to wait for it to marinate in the algorithm.\
\
[00:20:01.530] - Liz\
So we've talked about kind of what makes it saveable, where we're like it's inspirational and but what what makes a Pin really, really clickable? Like, let's talk about that for a second, because ultimately they want clicks, that's what matters.\
\
[00:20:13.350] - Liz\
Like your number of impressions or your reach really doesn't matter. It's how many clicks are you getting?\
\
[00:20:18.240] - Carly\
Yes, absolutely. So clickable content is obviously content where the reader wants to know right now what is on the other side of that Pin. So, yes, people do save our Pins with the intention to come back and read later. But let's not rely on those people for traffic, because how often do you start a project and then. Always come back to the project later to finish it, right? Ya, I know I'll save ideas. I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this toilet paper roll monster.\
\
[00:20:50.280] - Liz\
I also like haven't been able to view my boards on desktop, so.\
\
[00:20:53.430] - Carly\
Oh, really?\
\
[00:20:55.260] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:20:55.770] - Carly\
That's not good.\
\
[00:20:56.820] - Liz\
But like with my clients and stuff, too, I was like, well, how am I supposed to find my ideas? But but I'm wondering if that's just a business account aspect.\
\
[00:21:04.770] - Carly\
We can hope so. But regardless, it's a good example of why we shouldn't we shouldn't count on the people who are saving our Pins to be the ones who are going to click them later. What we really want to do is have people clicking through the feed when they find our Pins now.\
\
[00:21:17.910] - Liz\
So, yeah, it's also another reason why I'm like, OK, I am kind of moving away from group boards, even quality ones because I'm like, if you can't see them.... Sorry, sorry, but back to clickable content. Sorry,\
\
[00:21:29.600] - Carly\
The glitches they come up with just ruin my life. So clicks happen from multiple places in the Pinterest feed, one place being, well, the main one place being the Pinterest home feed, when somebody is just scrolling. The second main place being Pinterest search, when someone searches for an idea and then your Pin surfaces and they are looking specifically for that idea. So they click it. So. It's a little bit harder, I would say, to get that instant click from the home feed.\
\
[00:22:07.610] - Carly\
But for people who like them, OK. But for people who, who are blogging on subjects that don't have a huge search volume, that is the best place to get the click. So, how would you get the clicks in the home feed? It is being extremely, like it is OK to be clickbaity on Pinterest, let me say that. If you deliver on your clickbait-y idea on the other side, if you're not misleading, people clickbait-y titles are fine.\
\
[00:22:46.890] - Carly\
One of my most popular Pins of all time has three complaints about the clickbait title on the Pin. But it doesn't matter, I'm sorry that those people felt like it was clickbait-y. I delivered the full solution to the problem that I was talking about on the other side and I don't feel bad about my clickbait title at all. So go ahead and use clickbait, things like, things that sound a little bit unbelievable.\
\
[00:23:12.540] - Carly\
That title, for example, is "How I Cured the Terrible Twos in two days" and parents who are struggling with a toddler in the terrible twos. They're going to click on that when it's scrolls by, just the clickbait nature of it will cause them to click and actually that Pin ranks now and people click on it when it ranks, also. But using the word like "dangerous" or "mistake" or "overwhelmed" things that really speaks to the underlying emotions that your target reader could be feeling in the moment when they're scrolling.\
\
[00:23:52.830] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:23:53.190] - Carly\
Those are really good ways to get clicks right in the home feed.\
\
[00:23:58.260] - Carly\
They're also good ways to get clicks after ranking.\
\
[00:24:01.110] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:24:01.410] - Carly\
But after ranking, you can also get clicks with the, with the more straightforward title, the less clickbait title like, you know, five ways to deal with the terrible twos that that could be a title for the same article. But you can get clicks with that title also in the search.\
\
[00:24:25.170] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:24:26.130] - Carly\
Whereas it's all going to be harder to get clicks with that title in the moment in the home feed.\
\
[00:24:32.610] - Carly\
Does that make sense?\
\
[00:24:33.420] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah. Like as the child is screaming, you're like, I don't need five ways, two days sounds great.\
\
[00:24:38.520] - Carly\
Exactly. And I mean, you never know exactly what's going to go by in the home feed. But Pinterest is very, very targeted, like Pinterests knows if you've been looking at content about your angry two year old, they know that. And they will send you more stuff like that.\
\
[00:24:55.320] - Liz\
Yeah, the Internet is creepy. We all know that\
\
[00:24:57.630] - Carly\
The Internet is creepy. And, you know, I, I actually was so creeped out by Pinterest last summer, I almost couldn't use it anymore. My in-laws were visiting and I bought them Strombo cider at the liquor store. And I had I had never bought Strombo cider before. And the next day Pinterest started advertising Strombo cider to me and it had never advertised before. And I had to like look into how they knew this because I was like Pinterest can't hear me through my phone.\
\
[00:25:28.740] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:25:29.700] - Carly\
But apparently MasterCard gives your information. They, they sell not your personal information.\
\
[00:25:37.470] - Liz\
No,\
\
[00:25:37.950] - Carly\
Just your purchase information. Yeah, I didn't know that. But I also know Pinterest is creepy. I couldn't believe that they could target me that way.\
\
[00:25:49.080] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. No that's that's insane.\
\
[00:25:53.220] - Carly\
But sorry, so back to clickable and saveable yeah, clickable will will definitely have some sort of missing information whereas saveable Pins have all the information. Clickable Pins will be something else.\
\
[00:26:11.310] - Liz\
Yeah. It's the open loop thing that when you, when you're in all those business books and psychology and people want to close the loop and so yeah.\
\
[00:26:20.040] - Carly\
So for example, how I, how I cured the terrible twos, the two days. Well, how did you do that. I mean, yeah, I didn't put that information on the front of the Pin. I didn't even hint at it. Another one of my really popular Pins is "The Number One Mistake Parents Make When Potty Training." What is the number one mistake, you know they have to know?\
\
[00:26:40.840] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:26:42.870] - Carly\
I tried also putting a different title below the Pin. So instead of putting, you know, the same thing again, "what is the number one mistake parents make?"\
\
[00:26:53.830] - Carly\
I've added extra information in the title underneath the Pin by saying doing this makes potty training take way longer. So now not only do they know there's a mistake, they know that the mistake adds time to potty training.\
\
[00:27:08.910] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:27:09.690] - Carly\
No one potty training wants to do that. They want potty train... So the Pin is extremely clickable, it brings thousands of pageviews a week.\
\
[00:27:17.100] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. So definitely think of all the places that you can help encourage people to click, like your title, your description, the title on the Pin versus you know, so, people just recycle and I'm like you could, you could do so much more.\
\
[00:27:32.760] - Carly\
You could do so much more.\
\
[00:27:33.900] - Carly\
And you know, if you find that you have a Pin that is getting a ton of impressions and not a ton of clicks. Look at the further stats. You can click in to see more stats, and if that Pin is getting a lot of close ups where people actually open the can, you can edit the description to try to give more, because if they close up to the Pin, then they're going to see the description.\
\
[00:28:02.300] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:28:02.960] - Carly\
So if you're feeling like you could encourage a click through, it's very much the same as if you're ranking in the first three spots in Google, but you feel like your click through rate's not good.\
\
[00:28:13.820] - Carly\
What can I improve in my meta or how can I improve my title to make people click. Yeah, the same idea. What can you do in your description when there's already close ups if people aren't even closing up on your Pin, don't worry about it.\
\
[00:28:26.810] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:28:27.380] - Carly\
They're not seeing your description anyway, but when they're close up on your Pin and they're not clicking. What can you put in your description that could encourage the click? So don't be afraid to edit.\
\
[00:28:38.630] - Carly\
Now, if the Pin is ranking, I would be hesitant to take things out of the description. But go ahead and add things into the description. That would be.\
\
[00:28:49.520] - Carly\
Yeah, just like, just like with something is ranking on Google. Let's not take away the information that the algorithm might be using.\
\
[00:28:56.690] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:28:57.320] - Carly\
They got the result that you were hoping for.\
\
[00:28:59.330] - Liz\
Yeah, certainly add to it. All right. Any last bits of advice, clickable versus linkable, or clickable versus saveable content?\
\
[00:29:11.240] - Carly\
Well, do remember, like, I see a lot of people frustrated with their lack of click through on Pinterest, but do you remember that when people come to Pinterest, they are often looking for actionable ideas, which means that if your content doesn't lead to an action, so, for example, if your content is a funny short story, that is always going to be harder to get a click on because the person is not taking action on what they're looking for there. So if you feel like you're doing everything right with your Pin, then you might need to rethink the the actual content that you're putting on Pinterest and what the user intent is of a person on Pinterest, because that is what makes a click or saveable Pin.\
\
[00:29:55.830] - Liz\
OK, yeah, no, I think that's a great point to end on.\
\
[00:30:01.190] - Liz\
Definitely. Check out Carly's site. She has a great freebie for you guys. You want to tell them about it?\
\
[00:30:07.400] - Liz\
Yes, I have Pin templates for you and I am really excited about. Well, I've I've been using a lot of Pin templates this year because putting out a lot of Pins is a really crucial, new pins. So we can't just keep repeating the same image over and over. Templates make that process a lot faster. And I've made thousands and thousands and thousands of very successful things on Pinterest. My templates are designed to stand out in a feed, before we can be clicked or saved we have to be seen, so my templates are designed to get your Pin seen, check them out.\
\
[00:30:43.550] - Liz\
Yeah. So those are free, the link to that below. And then if you've got the Pro Pass or if you are thinking of getting the Pro Passss, Carly's included something in that, in there as well, A Pinterest Traffic Title Hacks?.\
\
[00:30:54.320] - Carly\
Yes, and so we did touch on two out of the Title hacks that are that we go further into detail in the book, which is making a different title below your Pin and what's on your Pin to encourage a click. And we did touch on the importance of aiming it at an emotion, an underlying emotion of your end reader. But there are also five other title hacks in that book that will encourage click through. Click throughs is what is so important for a lot of bloggers.\
\
[00:31:24.770] - Liz\
Yeah, and if you get Pro Pass, you'll get access to that too. So check it out. Carly, again, thank you so much for being a part of the Summit. I always love having you and I just I can't thank you enough.\
\
[00:31:38.390] - Carly\
Thank you for having me. I always love a good chance to talk about Pinterest.\
\
[00:31:41.370] - Liz\
So. Yes. All right. So, yeah, if you guys have questions, you know, if she's in the chat and she's, she's awesome, she's always very helpful. Join her Facebook group. She gives great advice there, too. So\
\
[00:31:54.890] - Carly\

[00:00:09.170] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
Guys, I'm super excited for the session with Kristen Larson from Become a Pinterest today and believe in a budget. Christine, thank you so much for being here. I'm excited to have you.\
\
[00:00:17.750] - Kristen Larsen, pinterestva.com\
Yeah. Thanks for having me.\
\
[00:00:19.910] - Liz\
Because I learned so much from from you in terms of Pinterest marketing. I actually did work as a Pinterest VA. I have a couple of clients I still hold on to, but I moved away from other stuff. But it was such a great course that I took from you. We're not selling you this course. I'm just saying Kristen knows her stuff. But yeah. So, I know you got a lot to share with us. I'm going to let you just take over.\
\
[00:00:43.550] - Kristen\
Okay, cool. I'm excited to be here. And I want to talk about how to grow and scale your Pinterest marketing strategy as a blogger, because I know first hand, when I started my blog back in 2015, I started at scratch, I started at zero. And whether you're brand new blogger trying to figure out how Pinterest works or you've been a blogger, but you haven't quite figured out, what you do with Pinterest. I feel like we can go over some really great topics today. So, the first one I want to talk about is the big question, like why Pinterest? And I know we have all heard about the benefits of it. And I was actually on their website recently and I learned a couple of fun facts. The first one is- I even wrote these down. 97% of top searches on Pinterest are unbranded. And basically what that means is that we all have a clean slate as a blogger. That means when somebody goes on there to do a search, they're not specifically looking for a certain website or a product or anything specific. It is our opportunity for us all to be equal and really have an amazing pIn. So, I think that's really cool. And the other thing Pinterest said was "Before a user has made up their minds with a blog or brand to work with, this is your time to reach and build an audience." So, I think that's also really cool, too, because this gives us an opportunity to reach so many people. We have no idea where they're coming from, but we know whatever kind of blog posts we're publishing, someone is on there looking for your content. So, I just think it's really neat that, you know, we're- we're not in the whole starting out. We are just fresh and people can find us. And I just think it's really, really cool.\
\
[00:02:30.440] - Liz\
Yeah, no, I- everyone sort of starts from the same baseline, whereas I mean, I love SEO and google and that's amazing. But it takes a lot longer to get traction there. I mean, take you can take a while to get traction on Pinterest, but not nearly as long.\
\
[00:02:43.880] - Kristen\
Yeah. And I think what's interesting is that like a few years ago, especially when I got started, you could publish a pin and start to get traffic like crazy within like a week. Now it's a little bit longer, but it is still the fastest tool that I have personally found in terms of having that reach and getting clicks and traffic back to my website and for clients websites, that kind of thing.\
\
[00:03:06.400] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:03:06.790] - Kristen\
So, a couple other things I want to talk about is why Pinterest works as long as you follow the rules. So my biggest thing I have noticed, especially the past six months or so, is that we're hearing a lot of gossip and chatter, but we don't know what's true and what's not. And I think it's so easy for us to be in a group setting online and start to say, "Well, this isn't working. So Pinterest is out and it's no longer a thing I'm going to focus on. And I'm going to go here instead." And the thing is, it's gossip. We just don't know. We have to really just listen to Pinterest and what they're saying. You know, there's different hacks, I guess, out there or different strategies. I think that works. But I think at the end of the day, we just need to listen to what Pinterest is telling us. One of the biggest things they told us in 2020 was all about the fresh pin. And for a lot of us, it was creating a brand new pin, whether it was for a new blog post or an older blog post. So guess what? We all did it. We were like, "Okay, Pinterest, we're going to do this." And we all started creating a ton of images for blog content. Recently, Pinterest came out and said, "You know what, this still isn't the ideal experience for the user and it's all about the user." So, their new strategy, they want us to focus on it as a creator, as bloggers is just creating one great Pin for one piece of content. So, all blog posts that we're going to be writing in the future. Let's just make one killer pin and focus on sharing that where we think it's going to be seeing the most online. So, it could be one of your own personal boards you created on Pinterest. You know, group words are still a thing. They don't work for everybody. But if you are in a group board that has great traction, share it there. Right. So, I think that's a really helpful tip from Pinterest. And then the other thing I have to say about that is Pinterest wasn't created for bloggers. And I think sometimes we kind of had this conversation where we're like, "Well, how dare Pinterest do this? And now my views are down and my impressions think at the end of the day, it's all about the users experience. We're just there trying to hopefully monetize and get traffic back to our website. So, I think we have to remember that because even I get mad if I'm like, "What happened to my page views? What happened to my traffic? And it's again, it's about the user. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:05:30.890] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:05:31.070] - Kristen\
It should.\
\
[00:05:31.070] - Liz\
I feel like it should. Yeah, no, I feel like if there's one thing you take away from the Summit because we've covered it over and over again in so many sessions, it's all about user intent. What experience are your readers having or what the experience- experience of someone on Pinterest or searching for something on Google? Or whatever it is, it's all goes back to user intent and trying to answer whatever it is they're looking for.\
\
[00:05:55.580] - Kristen\
Yes, I totally agree. So, with that being said, that there's two things I think we should be focusing on. So, it's going to be solid SEO, which you talked about a minute ago, and then our Pin design. We need to have both of those in order for our pins to show up in the search result. We've all heard a million times Pinterest is a visual search engine, so it's not just straight up Google. So, we have to focus on making a beautiful pin that is going to catch your eye. But we also have to have a reason behind it. So when it comes to SEO, our biggest thing we need to focus on are keywords. Are keywords are everywhere. And a keyword is your bio about yourself. When you create your profile, it's going to be the name of your group board, etc. It's going to be a name of your personal board. It's going to be a description of your board. It's going to be the description of your pin like that is where our keywords are at. We have so many opportunities to use keywords about our blog posts. So I'm going to give you guys an example. One of them is I'm going to find it. So, I wanted to make sure I went through my stats to show what is working. I have this pin from 2016. It is still doing great. I have pins I created six months ago that are just not getting any traffic. And I have this one pin from 2016 and it is all about saving money at the grocery store. And that is something that is evergreen, it's not seasonal, it's not trendy. People are going to be searching on how to save money all the time.\
\
[00:07:26.870] - Kristen\
So, I have this pin and so I have this pin and I think, Okay, if this pin is doing really well, I should make a personal board and talk more about saving money at the grocery store. So I create a board and I'm going to call it "Grocery Store Budgeting". Those are some great keywords to be using. Then for the description of the board, I'm going to call it "How to Save Money and Stick to a Budget while grocery shopping". So while there is a tiny bit of overlap with the keywords, I'm also inserting new words like money, shopping and sort of saying grocery store budgeting. Then from there, my pin is going to say, "breaking down my weekly fifty dollar grocery budget." That's what it was like five years ago as a single person. So totally different, but again, different keywords. And then when I go through that and I see how much traffic it's getting, it makes me think, "Okay, how can I create a new blog post?"\
\
[00:08:23.480] - Kristen\
So, my new blog post then is "How to Save Money on Groceries as a Couple". So that's just different things you can do for like more blog content, which is what we're talking about. But it just goes to show how you can start taking one, can turn it into a board, start adding more content, content to it and start getting a lot more traffic. So, that's just one example. I think if you're a blogger, look at your top five blog posts, see which ones are doing well, doing that. Do they have great boards? Like have you created your own personal board? Are there any killer group boards still out there? Check your descriptions. How can you add on to it? There's just so much you can do with just five of your blog posts if you go on forever.\
\
[00:09:04.520] - Kristen\
Another thing I want to talk about for finding your keywords, because people I get this question. A lot of people just don't understand where these. Words come from one of the best ways I like to find key words, Okay let me back up. The basic way is to do a search and type in "saving money at the grocery store" and it's going to pop up a ton of pennies. So cool. I can see who else is posting about this type of thing or sharing pens. Below that search bar. You're going to see lots of bubbles that help you make like longer sentences that have more like specific words to them. But my favorite one is inside of doing a promoted pin. Promoted pins, you do not have to run a promoted pin campaign and pay if you want to just do keyword research. So, I have been doing this forever. So, you go in and pretend you're creating a promoted pen, you're going to walk through a few different steps, but then you're going to get to this like magical keyword box and you're going to go ahead and type in like grocery shopping. And from there you're going to hit enter and it's going to populate like hundreds or thousands of phrases that have to do with grocery shopping. And from there, it'll say, well, this one's had three million searches. This one's had okay, maybe one hundred searches. So, you're going to kind of go through and organize ones that you think would really work to your audience. And you're going to take those keywords and then you put them in your forward description, your Pin description, the name of your board, everything. So it's a little bit more of an advanced feature. It sounds a little crazy, but everyone should be doing this because it is free and it's organic.\
\
[00:10:42.860] - Liz\
Yeah, no, I, I've actually run a couple of pins in the past and I never thought to just go use the keyboard part so...\
\
[00:10:49.690] - Kristen\
Yeah, it seems intimidating because a lot of times people start with the promoted pins and they're like, "Uh, I'm just going to keep hitting enter but I don't know what's going to happen. No, you can do it for free. I like to copy and paste, put them into a spreadsheet. And that way when I'm creating blog posts in the future, I know what keywords are really popular on Pinterest and then I kind of put them into my blog post. So, I think there's a lot you can do with that.\
\
[00:11:16.590] - Liz\
Got it.\
\
[00:11:17.040] - Kristen\
Okay. The next thing I want to talk about, I first I said SEO is killer. The second one, of course, is our Pin design. Pinterest has been really good to us for a while about our sizing. When I started in 2015 as a Pinterest virtual assistant, one of the main reasons I was getting hired by bloggers was because back then everything I Pinterest had really wide pictures. It was just the thing. So I was in a great spot at a great time because I knew everyone was hiring me to make the long pictures that we see today. We have been using this like two to three ratio for the longest time. And I'm so happy because that day ever comes where they reverse it, we are all in a lot of trouble. We're going to have to definitely outsource that to get all these new pins done. So hopefully that's kind of stay the same for a long time.\
\
[00:12:05.400] - Kristen\
Other things with Pin design that are still popular, we still have white space. We still want to see big fonts, Pinterest said, don't use font smaller than like size twenty one because no one's going to be able to read it. If you want to use your logo, make sure it is not like in the bottom corners because those could get cut off if someone's looking at Pinterest like on their phone. So, we want to keep those kind of like in the center of your pin. When it comes to branding, I'm actually like keeping a lot of my pins looking the same. I think if you guys are using a tool like Canva where we can create amazing graphics and templates over and over again, I like keeping mine fairly consistent. And the main reason is when I want to Pinterest I can tell who's pinging what base and what their pins look like. And I'm always excited to see if someone I follow has a new pin because I can tell right away. So, I think it's something like important to be said about being consistent.\
\
[00:13:05.050] - Kristen\
Okay, so, yeah, those are my two big tips about that's another thing I want to talk about that I talked about earlier, is promoted pins a little bit more.\
\
[00:13:15.160] - Kristen\
So, with everything I just said, all of that is free. All of that is organic growth. I think that is super important. You never know when that pin is going to go viral. So, you need to be working on that all the time. But if you want to kind of like go to the front of the line, you should be doing promoted pins. They are just becoming so popular about two to three years ago now, maybe like two years ago, we couldn't touch promoted Pinterest bloggers.\
\
[00:13:45.370] - Kristen\
Pinterest was very serious about if you don't have a ten thousand dollar monthly budget, you cannot do a promoted pin. And it was really frustrating because they only wanted to work with these high level brands. Only in the past couple of years have we been able to do promoted pins with any kind of budget. So I like it because if I want to promote something as a blogger, like maybe I'm promoting a new course or I have a great freebie, I want to get out there because I want to grow my email list or I want to work on like affiliate income promoted pins can be done for as little as like five bucks a day. And we have gotten some amazing results from these five dollar pins. So yeah. So, I want to share some statistics. So if anybody is watching, write this down, because this is some great information. The first one case study we did is we had a client and first of all, promoter pins, you should run them for at least 30 days. It's going to take time to gain traction. It's not like a Facebook ad. If anyone's looked at Facebook ads where you can see results in like 24 hours and, you know, this is working or this isn't working, Pinterest isn't that fast. It's just not designed to be like that.\
\
[00:14:55.840] - Kristen\
So, here is a great example of someone of a client who did a 30 day promoted point campaign. And I'm just going to share the first 14 days because it's crazy. So we ran one ad and that means we did like one- we did two different pins we picked from. So our whole type of campaign was just traffic. We just wanted to get traffic back to the client site and we wanted to kind of increase their email list and we wanted to help them make money because they were doing some like affiliate marketing.\
\
[00:15:26.590] - Kristen\
So here's what we did. And then 14 days we spent $62.70 cents. We sent them 433 clicks out of that $62 in two weeks. We also got free clicks out of it. And this is something that will show up when you're on your campaign. But basically Pinterest will reward you as you start to get more clicks. So, if you start to get a ton of clicks and it gets saved, other people, audiences from where they've saved that pen will start to see it and click on it and Pinterest will not charge you. So, let's say, Liz, you share one of my pins that I promoted, you save it. You have twenty people that click on it. I'm not going to get charged because you've gone ahead and saved it. So, that's kind of cool. So, you're getting more than like what you're investing, right? So with that hour click through rate, we always want it to be over one percent. Pinterest tells us, "Hey, if you're Pin is getting less than 1%, there's probably something wrong with it."\
\
[00:16:27.970] - Kristen\
Change your pin design, change your description. Something's not working. Yeah, so we achieved like a one point three two percent click through rate cost per click. This is the big one. You guys Pinterest is going to ask you to pick your budget. How much do you want to pay per click. Always put in ten cents. It sounds really low but it will even pop up and say, "Yeah, benefits of working from home" For me are so cute.\
\
[00:16:56.980] - Kristen\
So, one of the things I love about this is you can override promoted Pin system, right? We're going to put in ten cents. I start every campaign at ten cents from there. You can go ahead and modify it over time. So, like let's say my budget is five dollars a day. I put in ten cents. It's going to be like fifty clicks. Right. I'm horrible at math, but that's like fifty clicks a day. Let's say you're not maxing out your five dollar budget. That just means you need to go back and increase your cost per clicks to like fifteen cents. So, you're just going to raise it a smidgen just to start maxing out your budget to get those click throughs. So here is the results. For 14 days we spent $62.70 cents for one 433 clicks. Their main affiliate that they were talking about in their blog post made $500. They had a second affiliate that was not like it didn't pay out as high. That made a little over $200. And then the other surprise was her email list grew by one third for her often freebie. So, the really cool thing about this is even though when those 14 days, we can't gauge how much she's going to make down the road if she sells a course or if she recommends like an affiliate or something like that. So that's going to come on down the road. But just in those 14 days, totally got the money back.\
\
[00:18:24.170] - Kristen\
So, that's like, amazing. Okay, so I think these are like amazing results. So I'm always big on our ROI return on investment. So, if I'm going to spend $62 to go make 500 here, another couple of hundred here, grow my email list by a third - sign me up for promoted pins all day long. So, that is a great entry level to start. So whether you're a new blogger with just a few blog posts and you really want to start trying or you've been around, go for it.\

[00:18:55.460] - Kristen\
The other one I want to talk about is the extreme opposite end. This one we did a case study for, I had a client and we did a 30 day campaign. I'm finding it. Okay, this one's a little more wild. We had a $100 budget per day for 30 days, so we would have spent about $3000 on ad spend. We came in just a little bit short of that. Return on investment was 11,200 in affiliate income.\
\
[00:19:27.860] - Kristen\
So, they were promoting a higher end product. They gained 4572 email subscribers, not to mention who knows what's going to happen after those 30 days. So, I can't I can't monitor that. I don't know what they're going to get out of it, but that is really crazy to me. So, for $3000 to get the $11,200 of income plus or 4400 subscribers, that blows my mind. So I think that's crazy.\
\
[00:19:59.300] - Kristen\
Now, if you're scared to do a campaign, you can hire somebody. Like if you don't have the time, you don't know what you're doing, you can always hire somebody. You can start at the low end of the five dollars a day for your budget. You can increase it gradually to get it up to a hundred dollars. It's up to you what you're trying to promote. I just wanted to show the humongous difference of what promoted pins can do for you.\
\
[00:20:23.210] - Liz\
But I wouldn't just, I just want to add, because you point out the ROI, so you want to have some sort of goal on what you're promoting, right? You don't want traffic just for ad revenue because that's not necessarily going to provide the ROI that covers that ad cost. So, an affiliate link, product.\
\
[00:20:38.390] - Kristen\
Yeah, although I would say I've talked to a lot of food bloggers and for them their primary source of revenue is ad revenue, which blows my mind because I don't focus on ad revenue at all.\
\
[00:20:51.140] - Liz\
So, I think it depends what you're doing. So, some food bloggers have these crazy blog posts where they're especially like quarter four or even Q3. They can make so much money off of ads. Now, for those of us that are personal finance bloggers, we do great and I personally do great in Q1. Yeah, I also have ads. Some ads do horrible because that's when companies have no marketing budgets. So I can't rely on ad revenue. But I know Q1 is a great time to do blog posts that are about, you know, working on my budget for the year, saving money, getting out of debt so you could run a campaign in Q1 that is all about maybe you're selling a budget spreadsheet or one of those really pretty coloring charts, but you color in that help you track debt or pay off debt. So, I think, yeah, like you said, you have to have a goal. Don't just run a campaign, have a goal in mind of what you want to achieve.\
\
[00:21:45.680] - Liz\
Yes. I just want to point that out because you don't want to spend money to spend money.\
\
[00:21:52.700] - Kristen\
Right. And I think some people do that, like I think one of the red flags I look at as clients is when they come to me and say, "How do I make ten thousand dollars a month?" "How do I get ten thousand new visitors to my site?" "Why am I seeing results after 30 days of Pinterest like it takes time?" Organic is the way to go. Like I said, you've got to do that slow roll and build it up because that's something we're probably going to be using for a long time. Pinterest isn't going anywhere, but you can also be using promoted pins, especially like like you're doing a big launch or you're doing something special. Definitely do promoted pins and it's affordable more so than I think other platforms are.\
\
[00:22:30.120] - Liz\
Yeah, no. And I think ads have become much more accessible in general to smaller businesses.\
\
[00:22:36.740] - Kristen\
So yeah, I think so too. And I think especially now let's take advantage of that before things change.\
\
[00:22:43.910] - Liz\
I even saw- I think I saw an ad about that. Like Hulu you could do for like five hundred dollar budget. If you have a five hundred dollar budget, you could go on Hulu ads.\
\
[00:22:54.230] - Kristen\
Oh my gosh. I wonder how that would work.\
\
[00:22:56.300] - Liz\
I don't know. I didn't actually look at it, but I found it interesting. And I was like, "I might just go look at that just to see what that is, because that is crazy that's opening up stuff too."\
\
[00:23:05.580] - Kristen\
That is interesting or I wonder, like a tick tock, like I've seen ads on tick tock. I wonder how that would work. Yeah, it's interesting, right? I'm so fascinated by how all this stuff works, like on the back end.\
\
[00:23:18.100] - Liz\
Yeah. Same. No, I think that was some fantastic information and advice. If you do love Pinterest the way Kristen does and you want to kind of get paid to do it, then I would recommend, of course, personally; it pays for itself with your first client, typically. But yeah. So, I'm just throwing that out there. Is it any final words or something you want to share with them?\
\
[00:23:44.770] - Kristen\
Yeah, I think definitely take advantage of Pinterest, you know, it's a lot different than Facebook, it's different than Twitter is different than Instagram. I love Pinterest so much because people can literally click on it and go back to your website. So, if you are nervous about Pinterest, don't be scared to talk to a Pinterest. Don't be scared to have a conversation about hiring somebody. You don't have to hire somebody full time, but you could absolutely talk to someone and say, "Can you just help me get started? Like, what do I need to do?" And there are people out there like our Pinterest VA center say, "Sure, here's what we need to do with your account." Here's your to do list. Go for it." So, I think there's a lot of options out there. Don't be intimidated by working with somebody.\
\
[00:24:27.700] - Liz\
Absolutely. All right. And guys, the link is below. If you aren't sure where to get started finding a Pinterest VA, she actually she built this amazing community with her course and she has a Facebook group where they are all located. And you can, like, submit, hey, this is what I'm looking for and get get pitches. So I think the link to that is below. And if you're actually becoming one, there's more information on that page to the right?\
\
[00:24:50.650] - Kristen\
Yes that's it. You have two options to take a look at and see if you're interested in either one.\
\
[00:24:56.020] - Liz\
Awesome. So, definitely go check that out. Guys that Facebook group has a lot of great Pinterest feeds in it. Like, truly, you will get some amazing pitches from them if you're looking to hire. So, so.\
\
[00:25:08.440] - Kristen\
Well, thanks so much for having me. This was super fun. Get it.\
\
[00:25:12.580] - Liz\
Get going on Pinterest guys do some promoted pins.\

[00:00:00.500] - Liz Stapleton\
All right, guys. I'm really excited for this session with my friend Lena Gott from What Mommy Does and Adventures in Blogging. Lena, thank you so much for being part of the summit. I'm really excited to have you.\
\
[00:00:11.380] - Lena Gott\
Thanks for having me. This is great.\
\
[00:00:13.320] - Liz Stapleton\
I know because I miss you. I used to live in Raleigh, and we have this great group going. I haven't...\
\
[00:00:19.410] - Lena Gott\
I don't know. And you got a puppy, and I wanted to see a puppy. I know. You had to leave us and go across the country. I know.\
\
[00:00:25.800] - Liz Stapleton\
Anyway, but you are so good at what you do. And teaching others about it. And so, can you give everyone, in case they don't know you, which I find hard to believe, but in case they don't, a little bit on your background and what we're going to be chatted about today.\
\
[00:00:41.160] - Lena Gott\
Yeah. So my background is, my blog is whatmommydoes.com. I've been over there about eight... I always forget. I started around 2010, 2011, when I was in the middle of having kids. It was foggy in my brain what I was doing, and it dabbled on and off for years until I started taking it seriously. But I've been working in the online space for about 10 years, and I try to have fun with my blog and write about things that just mean something to me at the time. So my blog has evolved from budgeting and keep fun in the beginning when I had little babies to now I teach moms how to start businesses from home and more parenting type stuff now that I have more kids and know what I'm doing. Basically, I blog over there. I just love writing. And over the years, people started ask me how I grew my blog to be what it is. And so I, on accident, started the Adventures in Blogging brand, where I wrote a book. It did really well. People started asking me traffic tips and advice, and I started speaking, and just ballooned from there.\
\
[00:01:45.800] - Lena Gott\
So I have the whole course side of Adventures & Blogging, where I teach SEO, Pinterest, Google and Pinterest SEO, affiliate marketing, all kinds of stuff.\
\
[00:01:56.310] - Liz Stapleton\
All right. So obviously, you have a lot of experience, And I know you especially have a ton of experience with Pinterest, because I think that's where you started to really get traction, correct me if I'm wrong. So what do you think are some of... I talked with Carly, who I know you know, about how to best figure out your strategy for Pinterest, right? Because different niches, you need to do different things or search when you shouldn't, things like that. But keywords, which is what we're going to talk about, is so misunderstood. So what do you I think people gloss over or miss when it comes to using Pinterest to market their blog, especially when it comes to keywords.\
\
[00:02:38.770] - Lena Gott\
Oh, boy. Okay. I feel like this is like, I could go on hours and hours about this.\
\
[00:02:43.610] - Liz Stapleton\
I'll catch up. Sorry.\
\
[00:02:45.620] - Lena Gott\
Yeah. Just ask me questions. If I start getting off a tangent, you let me know. Okay. So there's just a few things. Actually, I'm teaching a new class right now, and so it's fresh in my mind some of the questions that people ask me in the beginning. So one thing I What I want to keep in mind is when you talk about keywords, I came from the world of Google SEO, and so I knew all those little tricks. And then when I got on to Pinterest, it was more visual. But then after I used it for a while, I realized that it's still based on the same rules that any search engine is because they have to be, because they have to have a way to organize the content on there. So Pinterest, in a way, it used to be more real-time-driven, and that's how a lot of people could see a lot of really instant results, whether or not they were using keywords at all, right? Because it used to be a real-time feed. As long as you just had your pins popping up there all the time, people were seeing it, people were clicking it.\
\
[00:03:39.940] - Lena Gott\
They were showing it to people no matter what. They've gotten away from that over the years. So if you can implement keyword strategies on there and understand where you should put your keywords, then you'll do a lot better. But don't let me forget, I want to talk about how specific you get with your keywords, too.\
\
[00:03:56.970] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, we'll definitely dive into that.\
\
[00:03:59.870] - Lena Gott\
But I always like to say the first thing that people need to know when it comes to Pinterest SEO is that there are only certain ways that you can tell Pinterest what your keywords are. And I call it your Pinterest keyword real estate. And so when Pinterest is looking at your Pinsand looking at your blog posts, they're not the same as Google where they're diving in, they're crawling your site. I mean, they might start getting there, but as far as I know, they're not there yet. They look at your actual pin, they look at where you pinned your pin, so they look at your board that you pinned to, what it's about, what other Pins are occurring. They call it pin co-occurrence on that board because they need a clue as to who to show this to. And these are the clues that they're taking. So where is it pinned? What other pins are around it? When it gets pinned, what other pinners pin it? So they're looking at all of this. So once your pin gets out there and it gets pinned by, let's say it's a budgeting pin, it gets pinned by all these different budget accounts, budgeting bloggers, people interested in budgeting, they start assigning these attributes to your pin.\
\
[00:05:02.250] - Lena Gott\
So we want to tell them things, give them clues. We want to make sure our keywords are on our board descriptions, on our board titles, that on the pin itself, they're starting to be able to read your pins. So that on the pin itself, it has the words that you want it to be recognizing you for your blog post title, which also appears when you look at it.\
\
[00:05:24.120] - Liz Stapleton\
That's a newer thing. Yeah.\
\
[00:05:26.760] - Lena Gott\
Yeah. Make sure your title of your post has the keywords in it or something similar and related. And your pin description that you can type in when you put the pin in. And also the meta description of your blog post, which a lot of people gloss over that part, I find, because Pinterest, it depends on how you're looking at it. I use it on the desktop a lot, and on desktop, it does show you it's pulling meta descriptions most of the time. I think whether or not they show it to you in the moment, they're still seeing it. So it's important that you have your your Pinterest keywords in your meta description, but that's overall good practice for SEO anyway, right? Because you want you want Google to be able to see that.\
\
[00:06:09.240] - Liz Stapleton\
Well, one of the things is, too, because a lot of people, and this is something hopefully people are moving away from, we're using their alt text for their pin description, or just using the same description from their meta description for their pin description. And that's really a mistake because you really have two different, or at least I think it's a mistake. Let me know if you think it's You have two different opportunities to really work in and tell Pinterest what your post is about or whatever it is you're pinning.\
\
[00:06:38.920] - Lena Gott\
No, I absolutely agree, especially on the screens, depending on where they're using Pinterest from. When they can see, let's say that somebody can see your image, your title, your meta description and the pin description all on that one screen, you don't want it to say the same thing. You don't want it to say best budgeting ideas for 2020, best budgeting ideas for 2020, best budgeting ideas for 2020 four times because it doesn't tell them why they should click over to your post. So just from a user standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. But also from a Pinterest standpoint, you're only giving them best budget spreadsheet. In that example, you could have given them all these other phrases.\
\
[00:07:17.840] - Liz Stapleton\
Budget tell us how to start a budget, how to use budget spreadsheets. I mean, we can go on and on. Yeah. So making sure you take advantage. I do want to quickly ask because I've moving away from them because I haven't found his hashtags. Do you still use hashtags? I feel like they really... I've started moving away from them, and I haven't seen a dip or anything for my client.\
\
[00:07:40.820] - Lena Gott\
I tried to use them some throughout, and Honestly, I never saw a big uptick when I did. And then it was just an extra thing for me to do. And lately, I honestly have not noticed. I haven't even been seeing them really on Pinterest. So I would say it's not important right now. And unless they tell us to pay attention to it, I wouldn't.\
\
[00:08:00.420] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah. No, I agree with that. I just wanted to share. Okay, so because it is easy, I like your point, it's easy to fall into that, have the title and then have the title in your description, and have that repetitiveness. So how do you go about deciding What? Because you don't want to be keyword-suffing. You don't just want to list a bunch of keywords or long-tail keywords. How do you go about the angle you take with your description? Because I've heard, Oh, you should write it like a fan. You should write... I've heard different things. And then how do you decide what keywords you want to get in there?\
\
[00:08:35.200] - Lena Gott\
As far as deciding the keywords I get in there, I would get into Pinterest like a regular person, honestly. That's how I recommend doing most keyword research. And look around. And I think one thing that I find that my students do, and that I used to be guilty of this too, when you find that you are finding keywords, because there's one thing to find keywords, there's one thing to find the right keywords. I find that a lot of time people try to do too much with each blog post. So I would say the biggest thing you could do when you're getting keywords is to hone in specifically on the thing that you're trying to help the person with and not try to go for everything under the sun, if that makes sense. So if this gets down to the purpose of the post, too, I think you have to back up and say, well, what is the goal that they're going to achieve with this post? And in the example, the best budget spreadsheet, what is the goal? Well, they're going to get an Excel file that they can download, and it's going to transform their finances, right?\
\
[00:09:33.860] - Lena Gott\
So I do, to answer your question, I do like to write it in an enthusiastic way because you got to think these Pins are making recommendations to people. You wouldn't go to your friend and say, Oh, yeah, I found this spreadsheet. Maybe you should use it one day, right? If you're going to make a recommendation, you'd be like, Oh, my gosh, look at this thing I just found. It was so easy. It helped me do this. It took me 10 seconds. You would use words like that, and you would actually recommend it with some enthusiasm. So I recommend being the same way in your description. But I know that it sounds weird because you're writing it about yourself. But it's just a, it's something I had to learn because I'm not that way. I'm not an exclamation.\
\
[00:10:17.220] - Liz Stapleton\
I know that we're constantly being like, Lena, come on.\
\
[00:10:21.250] - Lena Gott\
I'm very practical, matter of fact. But when I write on Pinterest, I am not.\
\
[00:10:27.280] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay, okay, good to know. So let's go back to keywords versus the right keywords and digging in on Pinterest. I don't know if you want to show an example that we can maybe... Because the keyword you want to depends on the intent, right? Like you're saying, it's what do you want them to achieve. And so finding the right keyword that ties to that is, I assume, where you're going.\
\
[00:10:51.710] - Lena Gott\
Yes, it is. We can do an example. Let me see if I can try to screen share. Well, first give me a topic because I feel like I want to use a different topic since we've already talked about budgeting.\
\
[00:11:01.410] - Liz Stapleton\
Let's do travel. Let's do travel or something. Like planning a vacation or something. Not necessarily a budget vacation. I know we're both in the personal finance space.\
\
[00:11:14.010] - Lena Gott\
How about we do a Disney World vacation or something? Tell me if you can see this. Can you see my screen? Yes.\
\
[00:11:26.870] - Liz Stapleton\
Sorry, I keep muting myself because my dog is...\
\
[00:11:29.080] - Lena Gott\
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, it's fine. He's not that loud, actually. Okay, so Disney Vacation. So maybe for a mom. So this is where I would start. I wouldn't just get in here and necessarily search Disney Vacation because I don't think yet. I guess you can. So let's do that. And we're looking at Disney Vacation, but you have to think from the person that's planning it. Would you just come into Pinterest and type in Disney Vacation if you were planning a vacation? I probably wouldn't. I probably I mean, I like to go specific.\
\
[00:12:02.290] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, and maybe be like Disney Vacation in the fall, or which Disney do I want to go to, or something like that.\
\
[00:12:12.520] - Lena Gott\
Yeah, I'm trying to think of what I did last time. So when we did Disney Vacation, we planned things like the resort we were going to stay at. I remember thinking that I wanted to take my kids to the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, and that was a big deal because it was expensive, but it was also very hard to get into. So that's one angle. What I like to do, and this is one thing that I recommend all my students do. It seems that if you would go very niche with your topic, that you wouldn't have as much traffic. But I find the more specific you can make your post, the more traffic you're going to have overall, because when somebody sees that, they're going to click on it, right? And it's just a really good place to start, I think. So for me, I would probably say, Like best Disney resorts for little kids, right? And this is just to show you because we can back out and I'll show you how I might brainstorm some keywords, but this is just to show you when you search this, People are writing these specific titles right here.\
\
[00:13:20.420] - Lena Gott\
Best on site property for large families, best and worst Disney World moderate resorts, five best Walt Disney World resorts for kids. So you can see there's There's a demand for this. Also, now that we're on here, I can show you we can talk about how here they're using their keywords here, Disney World moderate resorts, the best Disney World resorts. That's how they got to me. They talk about everything you need to know about Disney Moderate Resorts, the best Disney, modern Disney Resorts, and the worst, along with lots of details and pictures. And then they did use some hashtags. And then down here, everything you need to know. Look, theirs is the same.\
\
[00:14:00.170] - Liz Stapleton\
So I will- Look at they're the same, which- They're the same.\
\
[00:14:04.180] - Lena Gott\
I will say- specific, right?\
\
[00:14:06.500] - Liz Stapleton\
But they missed an opportunity. They could probably be showing up in more searches if they weren't the same.\
\
[00:14:11.960] - Lena Gott\
They could. And I will say, though, that this person probably has a meta description looking at how detailed their keywords are. Sometimes, Pinterest is super frustrating. And even though you have a meta description, it pulls your Pinterest description twice. So that doesn't mean we shouldn't be using our meta, but just remember, if you do see this and you're like, I put my meta description in there, where is it? It's just the way they're showing it. It doesn't mean they can't see it. So it does look funny. But you see how if you had put the same there, it would look really funny, right? I'm just going to see if I answer your right question. If you're trying to find the keywords, so let's say this is the word that I wanted to go, the post that I was looking for as a person searching it. If I was trying to find the keywords to go with that, I would probably start at the highest level but still niche section of Pinterest that I could go for. So for me, that would probably be Disney Resorts, not just Disney. And honestly, I would probably say Disney World because we go to Disney World.\
\
[00:15:18.210] - Lena Gott\
We live on the East Coast, and so that's what I know about. I don't want somebody to come to my blog and think that they're finding Disneyland, and then get Disney World back. So I want to stay in here But you can see that person that we just saw had probably come in here and she pulled best, moderate, and Disney World Resorts, and then she had families in there. So she had pulled all the appropriate keywords that you could go for. So if you If you just start clicking around, you'll see. So you're going to go for best Disney World Resorts. Just start backing back out and then see, because sometimes you can actually drill down even further. I think usually if the topic is bigger, this wouldn't have been the end of the drilling down that you can do. But in a niche topic like this, it is going to be. So as you can see right here, this is actually very straightforward. I would use the keywords best moderate Disney World resorts for families. Would probably be my title or my pin. There's still other considerations to take into for your title, but I would throw those in there, absolutely.\
\
[00:16:23.170] - Lena Gott\
And then start thinking of... I think one thing that people ignore is that synonyms are very important. Right? So to me, I might research resorts, but hotels was there. If hotels wasn't there, though, you should probably still use it because hotels is another synonym for resorts in the case of Disney World. And then when you put in hotels, look, it brings back cheap. So now we also see that cheap is something people are looking at when they're searching this.\
\
[00:16:50.760] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah. Then you really start to dig in. Yeah, I like that. And you'll notice one of them did hotels to get both in there. I saw that.\
\
[00:17:02.740] - Lena Gott\
It did. And then you can just back out. So if you're like, well, I still need some more to work with because sometimes people do a keyword research before they write the post, right? So I think that sometimes you can come in here and try to find the angle that you want. So if we just type in Disney World and nothing else, we can see that I'm pretty sure that Pinterest still does this. I've always thought that they put most important or most popular from the left to right. Just because it's a drill down list. Disney World pictures, we're not writing about pictures. The first one we come to that we're writing about is planning. I would probably click on that. Disney planning. Look, we know cheap was important, and it's telling us on a budget. So maybe my angle of my post might be Disney World Resorts on a budget, and then I would throw in how to save money, family vacations, and tips. You see, we started with the resort angle, and then we back, back out and thought, okay, well, if we go for on a budget, how to save money, family vacation tips, then we're really going to grab a lot of people that are interested in this.\
\
[00:18:09.830] - Lena Gott\
And that's where we get our angle for our post. So we're not just writing about all Disney World resorts anymore. We're going for only the ones that are for people trying to stay on a budget. And that's how you can narrow down the topic of your post, and you can get more people to it, even though it's only about this one specific thing.\
\
[00:18:27.150] - Liz Stapleton\
The idea is not just using it to optimize your pin, but to you plan your content as well, because like you said, it follows some similar rules with Google. So doing one is good for the other, too, typically.\
\
[00:18:44.010] - Lena Gott\
That's true. Okay. That's true. And I like doing this for Pinterest because, I mean, let's face it, unless you're a blogger like mousetravel.com, you know what I mean? The major Disney travel bloggers, and there's a lot of them that do only Disney posts. You have to really bring your A game and build up this mega site on Disney before you can compete for something like Disney World Planning on a Budget on Google. Yeah. Sorry. Is that truck really loud?\
\
[00:19:12.640] - Liz Stapleton\
I can't hear it. Okay.\
\
[00:19:14.870] - Lena Gott\
I thought it was on here. But on Pinterest, I feel like the playing field is a little bit more even because anybody can build up a good representation of Disney World advice through their boards and through their pins. And I feel like you're on a more even playing field, and you can actually compete with these bigger websites.\
\
[00:19:35.210] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay, so we talked about keyword research and how to go in and out and beckon and stuff. And we talked about it on your pins, but we haven't really talked about it, keywords on your boards, which can also make a big difference, right? Because of that co-occurrence, which something term like that anyway, because it helps Pinterest. It's all those little data points to explain it. So do you do the same keyword research method to come up with keywords for boards?\
\
[00:20:08.580] - Lena Gott\
I do. I would use the same exact method. And how detailed I get depends on how detailed the board is going to get. So Disney World Planning Board, I would probably come out here and use these as my guide right here when I'm talking. I would cater it to what type of content I'm going to do. I would probably throw in Disney World Planning on a budget. Probably not printables because I do a lot of printables, resorts, tips, kids, family tips, trips, that type of thing. Yeah.\
\
[00:20:39.530] - Liz Stapleton\
And those would each be different boards, or would those all be one board with all those keywords?\
\
[00:20:44.970] - Lena Gott\
I tend to like to make only a handful of boards on each major topic that I write on because I write about so many topics on my blog. So this would all be on one board. I would probably have a Disney World planning ideas. Disney World Trip Planning Ideas Board. And then the keyword description, because it can be usually about three sentences, would have a lot of these keywords in there. And that way I could pin any and all of my Disney World planning pins to it. And then also put other people's pins on it to give interest a clue that, Hey, maybe this is an important board for Disney World Planning. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:21:20.740] - Liz Stapleton\
Yep. No, that does make sense. Another thing I did want to ask you about is because I believe you do run at least one group board, if not more.\
\
[00:21:27.760] - Lena Gott\
Is that Okay.\
\
[00:21:30.650] - Liz Stapleton\
So with group boards, because I talked to Carly about how the more specific a group board is, it tends to be better to be on because it's that board co-occurrence. So how do you decide But she doesn't have group boards to run because of the time it takes to run them. So I would like to do you decide when to group board, how to set that up? I know yours is closed right now. I have one. I have it actually where they can do the click request rather than taking up description with that information. So as a group board, I know what you look at in terms of people you accept onto your group boards, but also just in managing it to make sure it stays quality, it stays something that's going to help everybody.\
\
[00:22:15.210] - Lena Gott\
Yeah. So group boards, I think you're right. I mean, group boards, or Carly was right when she said this, I love very, very niche group boards. I like them for my account because it just gives some variety, but I also like it for the networking. It's a chance to give my friends who are bloggers, and in this case, the personal finance niche, a chance to work with me, and we work together just to promote each other's things. So I don't look at it so much as like, Oh, my gosh, it's going to be the best for getting me traffic, because it may or may not be, right? But it's just a good place. It's like a community, almost. So I will say it is a lot to manage when you're currently letting people in, and then people aren't following the rules. That's why mine is closed right now, because it got to be... I wasn't spending a lot of time doing it, but when I logged in here, I would log in here and people would just have Pins in here that had nothing to do with saving money. And I would be deleting them.\
\
[00:23:14.970] - Lena Gott\
I had to go delete the pins, and I kicked out the person.\
\
[00:23:18.560] - Liz Stapleton\
I'm not doing a warning nonsense. Kudos to people that do your super kind to take that time. I'm like, Ah.\
\
[00:23:25.620] - Lena Gott\
It's hard, and especially when people automate what they A lot of times, I didn't even know. Some of my very good blogging friends were spamming my board, and I had to be like, Please don't do that. It was a little bit of policing in the beginning. It was a lot of policing in the beginning, but I will say now that I closed it, and these are all people that, most of them I know personally, you don't have to know people personally, but I know Ben from BTX Capital, is not going to spam my board. And all these people, they're not going to do that to me, and we got a groove going on. Now that it's gotten going, I don't police it like I used to. And it's been great because I know that for the most part, everybody's following the rules. And only if you want to be a super stickler, you need to come in here and police it all the time. But I've been happy the way it looks. I've been happy with the traffic that these things have been bringing me. And a fun fact, randomly, a famous person will message me and be like, Can I join your board?\
\
[00:24:25.380] - Lena Gott\
Dr. Laura Schlesinger asked to be on this board. That's That's cool. You got to get this be seen as known for a topic when you do something like this, and not just interest, but just people in your community.\
\
[00:24:38.310] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, especially when it's a niche where it's not just like, Hey, friends, just post your best blog post. That's not great.\
\
[00:24:44.700] - Lena Gott\
I'm not a huge fan of that, just because it doesn't mean anything. We're talking about the keywords. It doesn't work well.\
\
[00:24:50.700] - Liz Stapleton\
It doesn't help.\
\
[00:24:51.590] - Lena Gott\
It doesn't work well.\
\
[00:24:52.860] - Liz Stapleton\
To know what stuff is about. I think as far as policing goes, it's more like, set a reminder up on whatever whatever you use. I use ClickUp, maybe use Asana, or whatever. Set up a monthly recurring task. It's like, go in and look at your group board to make sure it's not a mess. And then if it is, kick out the people that are responsible and delete one day. I wouldn't be going in daily or whatever. But I had a friend, Jason Butler, if you know him. But he had, I was looking at his Pinterest. I was like, dude, this guy's totally spamming your board. Everyone else is doing a good job. You need to get them out of there. He was like, oh, I didn't even notice. So Just once a month, set a reminder to go check and make sure it's decent and people are listening.\
\
[00:25:36.210] - Lena Gott\
Yeah, I would say so, especially in the beginning, maybe even once a week when you're very first, you're still accepting people. But the cool thing about it, I like, is that I let these people in and I verified them before they got in. So I know when I want to go fill up another one of my budgeting boards with pens, that I literally can just go through and do a pinning spree of some of these. And that's very helpful because you don't want to have to sit there and think about every single pin you're pinning when you're just trying to maybe get a new board or something like that to take off. That's one way that I use this, and I like doing that. Oh, look, see, here's a duplicate. So this is all you do. Come in here, delete. And because you own the board, you can delete whatever you want, which is not. So she might not have known she pinned that twice. It could have been a glitch.\
\
[00:26:20.240] - Liz Stapleton\
I find tail one has a glitch sometimes where it'll do it twice.\
\
[00:26:25.720] - Lena Gott\
For the most part, people are following the rules and I'm happy with it.\
\
[00:26:33.430] - Liz Stapleton\
No, and it looks good. Yeah. Because there's a lot of people that are like, Don't join group boards. They don't do anything for you. And I don't think that's true. I think you have to be very particular in what group boards you're a part of, and especially if you're going to create a group for what it looks like. And I found for my clients as well as for myself, although I'm not good at doing it all for myself, the specific ones tend to work really well.\
\
[00:27:00.050] - Lena Gott\
Yeah, I think so. The good thing about owning one yourself is you can still pin whatever you want. You set the rule, they can only pin so much, but sometimes I might pin a little bit more because I feel like it. I like having the control over a board, and that's why when it's down to a personal board versus a group board in general, I always go for a personal board because you have so much time, and you can make that personal board as nice as you want, and you're not limited to, you have to only pin two pins a day. And that's so frustrating. I might want to put 10 a day for a couple of weeks to get it going, and then go from there, and you can't do that with a group board. Yeah.\
\
[00:27:41.290] - Liz Stapleton\
So I mean, there's a lot when it comes to Pinterest, but I think doing your keyword research and we touched on this, Carly, as well. Take yourself out of business mindset on Pinterest. Go in there as a user every now and then. Not even just when you're doing keyword research for yourself, but just go use it. Go find a dinner recipe or go, whatever, get some organization idea, whatever it is that you need help. Go and use it a little bit to remember what that's like, because the more you can put yourself in the mindset of the Pinterest user, because search intent is really just user intent. The better you'll be in figuring out what to do.\
\
[00:28:21.960] - Lena Gott\
I agree. I agree because if you don't use it as a person, then how are you going to even know? I mean, and especially since it tells you the keywords right on there. Yeah. You have to use it that way. Otherwise, you're just guessing. And why guess when it's going to tell you the answer, right?\
\
[00:28:35.980] - Liz Stapleton\
Absolutely. Okay. So any final words of advice for... Tell me, I know you got a great exclusive for our all access pass holders, but any last words of advice?\
\
[00:28:45.460] - Lena Gott\
It's something that just occurred to me that I do want to show. So we were talking about setting up your own boards, right? So let's say we're going to look at Disney World planning. I wanted to just show this because when you're making a new board, especially when you're new, it's hard to know what your board should be like. And I always say the whole point of SEO in general, and even on Pinterest, is that you're competing, right? You're competing to have the best resource on the topic because that's the point. You want to be shown first. You want to be ranked at the top. So if you are sitting here and you're like, Okay, I want to make a Disney World Planning Board, I would literally come in here and look up Disney World Planning, sort it by boards, and then just look around and see what people are doing. What does Pinterest think is the most important thing in this category? And you can also see how many Pins people have. You can see the one they're bringing back at the top has 190 pins. There's up to 792 Pins here. Just scroll down a little bit and see.\
\
[00:29:47.340] - Lena Gott\
I'm looking through here. Disney World Planning is actually a really good niche to me because the best boards that Pinterest is showing me, only a few have over a few hundred pens. Most have 25 or 40. This It gives me a hint. If I'm going to start a Disney World Planning Board, I need to plan on having, if I want to be the best of the best, I would say, aim for 400 Pins because only a few boards beat that. And just not pins of your own, But over time, put 400 pins on it. Be a curator, because that's what Pinterest is about, right? You're a curator on the topic. So if you're going to go for Disney World Planning, really curate a nice board that Pinterest would like, and eventually really, you will rise up to the top, and you will be shown up here as one of the best boards on the topic. And then all the pins you pin to it will do better overall. And it's just a good overall organic strategy, and it starts with the day you create your board, I think. Yeah.\
\
[00:30:44.800] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. I know that was like, I was like, Any final words? But I have to actually have a follow-up question. So because I think it's in the same idea as tailwind tribes, do you, what are your, what are your thoughts or pieces of advice as far as tailwind tribes go? Because part of me likes it, it's easier to tell the rule followers from then on. You know, but it is, it means you have to actually keep up with it too. So I just love to get your thoughts on, because tailwind tribes are very similar in the idea of group boards, but you're really directing it at other business owners to pin it out. So I was just curious what your thoughts on Tailwind was in that.\
\
[00:31:27.770] - Lena Gott\
I like the concept of Tailwind tribes. However, I will say when it comes down to the limited time I have to spend on my blog and on Pinterest, I don't spend a lot of time in there, only because anything that requires me to rely on somebody else doing something to make something happen for my blog, it's just not a strategy that it's going to be part of my main strategy. So I like being in there. And like you said, if I need to fill up a board with good content, I will go in a tribe, and I'll just look at the relevant tribe and pin some things from people I trust that I know has been curated by somebody else and use it that way. But I would not say, base a strategy on Tailwind tribes, because then you're putting your hands already a platform you don't own. You don't want to put the strategy in the hands of somebody else on a platform you don't own. It's just too much.\
\
[00:32:17.740] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, no, I agree with that, but it's more I feel like, like tribes be a great way when you're new to getting things the ball rolling on Pinterest, because it can sometimes getting into group boards can be a little difficult. You can obviously create your great own boards, and that'll help. But if you're looking for a little extra oumph, that can be a good place to start when you're brand new, your marketing on Pinterest is my take on it.\
\
[00:32:43.020] - Lena Gott\
They weren't around when I started, so that was not- This is the same here.\
\
[00:32:45.890] - Liz Stapleton\
My clients, right? I have one that literally started at zero. And I know products helped us get to we were like at 400.\
\
[00:32:55.970] - Lena Gott\
I can see that. I can see that, especially when you're brand new. Because when you're brand new, you need all the help you can get. Exactly.\
\
[00:33:01.590] - Liz Stapleton\
Do you schedule stuff? Do you do Tailwind? I know Carly does manual pinning. Are you a manual penner?\
\
[00:33:06.100] - Lena Gott\
I rarely manual pin, just because I just don't have the time. I'm very think about what I pin, so I use Tailwind board lists, and I schedule things out that way and get activity on it that way.\
\
[00:33:17.990] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, no, I love the board list. I use it. That is my good. Because I don't remember. So many things to do every day.\
\
[00:33:25.590] - Lena Gott\
Exactly.\
\
[00:33:27.540] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. That was awesome. Thank so much for your insights. I hope everyone got a lot from it.\
\
[00:33:33.450] - Lena Gott\
You're welcome.\
\
[00:33:34.520] - Liz Stapleton\
Can you tell us, I know you got a great offer for our all-access pass holders. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:33:42.300] - Lena Gott\
Sorry, I can't hear it, but my neighbor boy is singing a song through a megaphone, I swear.\
\
[00:33:47.940] - Liz Stapleton\
You can't make this. I have to edit this video so much. It's going to be in a big so short. That's okay. That's okay.\
\
[00:33:53.490] - Lena Gott\
I think this stuff is good to include because this is real life. This is really me trying to blog if my neighbor is singing on a megaphone outside my window.\
\
[00:34:01.310] - Liz Stapleton\
I'll keep this little bit in.\
\
[00:34:04.320] - Lena Gott\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.310] - Meagan\
Hi, everyone. My name is Meagan Williamson and welcome to my Summit presentation on all things Pinterest for bloggers. I'm so so excited that you're watching my presentation today, and I hope that it's going to be an action hacked 25 to 30 minutes now. Like I said, my name is Meagan Williamson, so that is like Meagan, but not so Megan, like Meagan is something that I learned to say over the years. And I'm a Pinterest marketing expert and certified business coach. Now, I'm also really excited to share with you that I'm actually a Pinterest creator coach.\
\
[00:00:46.680] - Meagan\
So, I work alongside a Pinterest and help them to share best practices for bloggers or creators using the platform. Now we all know that there was an incredible amount of changes in 2020, 2021. And I'm going to be sharing some of those things, the observations and the knowledge that I have with you. And I want you to be rest assured that because I am a partner with Pinterest and one of their creator coaches, as well as an independent Pinterest marketing educator, I'm going to be sharing with you best practices from the platform.\
\
[00:01:19.520] - Meagan\
What I know is somebody who has seen all the accounts and also things that I've learned over the past eight years working intimately with my favorite search engine platform. So, a little bit about me, I actually started out as a blogger myself in 2010.\
\
[00:01:37.590] - Meagan\
It's been a lot longer than that. And at that time, I started a DIY and a core blog, and I figured out very very quickly that I was getting a lot of traffic from people pinning my content to Pinterest. I actually went viral overnight and it was incredible. And what ended up happening is that I started racking up a ton of followers. So, Pinterest loved on me, showed my account to a lot of people, and very quickly I gained over 100,000 followers on Pinterest.\
\
[00:02:06.070] - Meagan\
So, when that type of thing happens, if you're new to blogging or you've been doing it for a while, you know, that when you sort of get a lot of people following you, people start to say, hey, Meagan, can you teach me about how to use Pinterest for my blog? Or even businesses were reaching out to me and asking me if I could help them leverage, print and trust for their business or blog or part of my brand. And at that time, of course, I had the whole like, I don't know, like I know what worked for me.\
\
[00:02:34.840] - Meagan\
I actually have a background in school and child psychology. And so what I did was I did my due diligence and I figured out that what I needed to do to feel comfortable teaching Pinterest to other people as a side hustle was to figure out what worked for other accounts beyond just me.\
\
[00:02:54.140] - Meagan\
I'm going to be honest and say that as a creator, as somebody who makes their livelihood, or even as a side hustle or as a part time gig that you create content online. It's sort of like your shoe in it. All the platforms are going to love you because you're invested in creating high quality content. So, trying to make an account that wasn't a blogger or somebody who was a storyteller full time was tricky. I spent a year getting to know the platform and what worked for different people.\
\
[00:03:22.910] - Meagan\
And I began taking on Pinterest management clients and helping other business owners, bloggers, I would manage their accounts so that they could gain traffic and visibility with the platform. So that's how I got to where I am today. I now work full time as a Pinterest marketing educator.\
\
[00:03:39.170] - Meagan\
I run workshops. I run a Pinterest marketing membership. It's the largest in the world. I'm very proud of that. And I work with a lot of creators just like you.\
\
[00:03:47.200] - Meagan\
Okay, so, that aside, I know my stuff, and today we're going to be talking about and I know like, I don't spend a lot of time in Facebook groups because I find they're a bit of a drag on my energy. But what I do do is listen to my audience. And I know a lot of bloggers and creators have felt very, you know saddened or overwhelmed or frustrated with a lot of changes that we've seen out of Pinterest. So towards the end of the beginning of 2020. So, June of 2020, we saw idea Pins, or maybe it was in 2019.\
\
[00:04:21.530] - Meagan\
It's been a while idea pins were rolled out. They were formerly called story pins. They were tested out in the UK. Then we saw them come to the US, and what we saw is actually with that was this change towards multiformat content on the platform. And around that same time, we saw some massive algorithm changes in the fall of 2020.\
\
[00:04:42.070] - Meagan\
And a lot of people saw a significant drop in their impressions, monthly views and people seeing their content. And since that time, we've seen a bunch of changes. So, we've seen numbers drop. We've seen the importance of what we're calling fresh pins or fresh content. And then the concept or format of an idea Pin has advanced greatly.\
\
[00:05:07.540] - Meagan\
Now, if you've been living under a rock and you're thinking, Meagan, what is that idea pins are, a multi media, so you can use pictures and videos format. It's supposed to be dynamic storytelling that engages your audience in the platform. So, let's decode that. What does that mean?\
\
[00:05:25.660] - Meagan\
We have been trained to think that Pinterest has always been a traffic driver as a search engine. So if you're a newer blogger, you might be thinking, well, isn't it like Instagram or Facebook? Absolutely not. This platform is actually much more like Google or YouTube. So, it helps connect people with your content with your ideas, with your inspiring story for months and years to come.\
\
[00:05:50.200] - Meagan\
So, it's not just like pushing something out on Instagram stories and expires 24 hours later or even something. We know that the average lifespan of an Instagram post or a Facebook post is about one to two days. Whereas as a search engine, Pinterest wants to take your content, label it or index it, right, so that's that it can connect it to the right people at the right time. And that's the way they describe it. So, what that means is they index your content, they decide who it is relevant for, and they try to connect their user base with your content or your ideas.\
\
[00:06:27.090] - Meagan\
Of course, I always have a little itch here. This only ever happens when you're running workshops that your nose gets itchy. Now, so, as a search engine, it can give back to you for ages. But what we've seen is the shift away from being known as a traffic driving platform. And I know as a blogger you're saying, yeah, but Meagan, that's why I want to use it.\
\
[00:06:47.230] - Meagan\
But I want to share with you how things have evolved. So, Pinterest has gone all in on idea Pins, and that's what I was joking about. If you've been living under a rock and you don't know what an idea Pin is. Idea pins have become basically paramount to your success on Pinterest because Pinterest has gone all in and what it wants to do is encourage bloggers and creators. They use the term creator. I know that the focus of the summit is focusing on the term blogger, but as a platform, they wanted to provide a way for creators to share their content and their ideas without having to ask people to leave.\
\
[00:07:25.550] - Meagan\
Now, this has been really upsetting to a lot of people who make their income from ads on their website. And we have been traditionally trained that Pinterest is a traffic driver. Now it is becoming more social. And as the user base gets younger, which it has. And as other platforms evolve and change, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat all the platforms.\
\
[00:07:50.610] - Meagan\
Pinterest is no different. And let's just get real. Like as your social media marketing business coach for the time period of the duration of this workshop, things have changed an incredible amount across the landscape of social media. So, Instagram announced we're no longer an image sharing platform. YouTube brought out shorts when we used to go to YouTube for long fat format videos.\
\
[00:08:14.470] - Meagan\
So, Pinterest is no different. They're evolving with the people who are using it. So, if you're like, well, I'm on my soapbox here and I'm not using them, then it's not going to work for you. If you don't have that positive mindset and you don't want to shift with where the platform is going and where the people who use the platform, how they engage with content, then you're just not going to get love from the platform. So, I'm here to share some of the ways that you can get loved on by the platform.\
\
[00:08:42.220] - Meagan\
I want you to keep an open mindset and think about it in a holistic way. So, it's not possible for you to just share idea pins and have the growth that you used to have. Maybe you make a lot of video content or you make a lot of content for other platforms like Instagram or Facebook. I want you to think about how you can repurpose your content in a purposeful way for Pinterest to help reach more people, to increase your visibility and then think about that next step about how you could turn it into traffic.\
\
[00:09:13.920] - Meagan\
Now, we're not going to get anywhere if we're going to engage in really dissing and being negative and just dumping on the platform.\
\
[00:09:21.870] - Meagan\
I don't want that here. Let's keep it a positive space. Let's keep it on what we can do, what we can control. So, I'm going to actually share my screen with you. So, you can see here that I'm logged in on desktop. And we can see all sorts of things in my feed.\
\
[00:09:38.810] - Meagan\
Okay, so if we go to the Today tab. The Today tab is a wonderful place where it's going to provide today's inspiration. I really love going to the Today tab to see what is happening and what's popular. If you click on this, you can see they've curated some beautiful fashion. Amazing. Now this is a zero waste holiday craft.\
\
[00:10:02.210] - Meagan\
They know that this is coming up and what you can see in front of me is a collection of different pins. So, we have standard pins. So, look at this homemade potpourri , smells like Christmas morning. Over here, you can see that we have what's called an idea pin.\
\
[00:10:17.490] - Meagan\
So, this is easy, free and sustainable holiday door decor. You can see it's a beautiful video showing us how to make a holiday decor. We have a nice, beautiful call to action at the end here. So, what I want to point out to you is that there's a variety of pins. We have standard.\
\
[00:10:34.190] - Meagan\
We actually have quite a few standard pins here. So, we have standard pins. We have idea pins. We don't see any video pins. So, let's go back maybe to my feed and see if we can see some video pins.\
\
[00:10:46.970] - Meagan\
Now I just like to point them out because so, here's somebody who's taken a TikTok and turned it into a 1 minute video pin. Okay. So, you can see she has lots of reactions on this. This is interesting. Her TikTok watermark is there so you can see there's.\
\
[00:11:06.880] - Meagan\
Oh, my goodness. I love that they're like. So, what I wanted to show you was the three main types of pins. And what's important for you as a creator is I think a lot of bloggers traditionally think about, well, I can't drive traffic with idea pins. So, if we go to an idea pin, so here's a single story idea pin.\
\
[00:11:27.890] - Meagan\
You can see that there's no way for us to link to find more information. But know that as a creator, you're going to be getting access if you don't already to special features on the platform. Now I know we might be having people watching from all over the world, so it's going to be very different whether you're based in the US, the UK, Canada, or different parts of Europe or Asia. We get access to features at different times. But there is now a creator hub on mobile for people who have been identified as creators.\
\
[00:11:59.320] - Meagan\
I have it myself, log in and see if you have access. And what I want to share with you is that Idea Pins actually are going to have the ability to link to products. It is rather glitchy as well as affiliate links, so you can monetize your Idea Pins. Now, I'm not sure I don't have the official word from Pinterest, but I do have an inkling that they will eventually allow us to tell people where they can find more information. Thank goodness for technology.\
\
[00:12:31.110] - Meagan\
Sometimes life necessitates that you need to take a break because your pets need you, your kids need you. And that's what I love about working online. So, let's jump back into what you need to know about Pinterest this year. So, we already talked about the type of Pin formats.\
\
[00:12:47.040] - Meagan\
We know that Idea Pins do not have links currently as a destination link, but you can put product links and affiliate links. As I said, I do think that may evolve. We'll see what happens. That's just a hunch that I have due to feedback being shared. That said, the function of Idea Pins is to keep people in the platform.\
\
[00:13:08.750] - Meagan\
Now, if you want to have a look, you can actually look at the Pinterest Creators account. So, if you go to Pinterest creators, they have a wonderful account that will actually show you examples of Idea Pins for creators that they're working with. And this is where you can find information about the creator's hub. You can actually see Creators 101. So ,trends, you know all these different audience insights, pin stats.\
\
[00:13:39.750] - Meagan\
A lot has changed. And as I said, the social media landscape has changed so much that we really have to reframe how we look at, how we use Pinterest as a channel to get the word out. So, what I want to encourage you to do is to really think about how as a creator or a blogger that you can adapt and change instead of engaging in a negative cycle of what you don't like about it. You can share your feedback on their community boards, but the reality, they're bulletin boards.\
\
[00:14:15.890] - Meagan\
But the reality is that they've gone all in on Idea Pins.\
\
[00:14:19.740] - Meagan\
This is where they are going. They're not changing, that they have spent a huge amount of time and money on doing this. And what they're going to do is lean into the creators who are actually adopting the usage of Idea Pins. So, as a Pinterest strategist, when they first came out, I was like these are really cool, but how are we going to use them to our advantage? I always think about how you can leverage these types of things to help grow your visibility.\
\
[00:14:45.290] - Meagan\
So, what I want you to do is to reframe how you think about Pinterest. So, Pinterest isn't going to be just a traffic driving platform anymore, right? That's gone. That's Pinterest 1.0. Pinterest has changed. It's changed with the people.\
\
[00:15:00.960] - Meagan\
It's changed as it has evolved, it's become a more video friendly platform. I think we all felt that that was going to take a long time, and now it's here. And we see that people are actually staying in the app longer. They're engaging with the content, and this is the landscape. This is the future of Pinterest.\
\
[00:15:21.330] - Meagan\
This is the future of a lot of platforms. Their desire is to keep people in app engaging. And so, people need to find your content be served by your story. Learn about what you share with the world. So, no matter whether you come from food or fashion or beauty or DIY or education, that you are a unique original creator and that you're going to share ideas.\
\
[00:15:45.650] - Meagan\
Now, the but that I have is that it's also your responsibility to rise to the occasion to consider how you can continue to use Pinterest to drive visibility, to drive engagement, how you can make that part of your media pack. So, when brands want to work with you that you can share your amazing reach that you have on the platform. So that is your monthly views like how many people are actually seeing your content, how many people engage with your content and save it? And remember when people save your content, that's like a snowball effect.\
\
[00:16:18.830] - Meagan\
So, it's the gift that keeps on giving.\
\
[00:16:21.210] - Meagan\
And what we're seeing is the people who are open and receptive are being rewarded, so they're getting huge visibility, but they're always providing that next step. If you want to learn more, this is what you can do. Follow me on another platform or head to this blog post. Now there is some Gray zone about whether you can use that to learn more on my blog. Pinterest was really encouraging creators to not ask people to leave to get the full story.\
\
[00:16:49.600] - Meagan\
So, what I encourage you to do is to get creative with your content and think about how you can give a piece of the story and then encourage them if they want to learn more, to check you out, to follow you. And then you're going to be engaging in a practice where you're going to be publishing regular, fresh content. So, gone are the days where you can just share the same ten blog posts over and over and over again. And really what you want to do is to be contributing to the machine.\
\
[00:17:15.280] - Meagan\
So, it is a machine, right? It's a platform that rewards creators who are showing up and feeding its system with more and more and more knowledge just the same way that Google loves you when you become an authority in a particular niche or industry or domain area.\
\
[00:17:31.620] - Meagan\
Right? So, I want you to really think about that and think about how with that content that is going to be your vehicles for driving action. And that action is going to be inviting them to go to your website, signing up for your email list, following you on another channel like YouTube or Instagram. And you want to think about Pinterest as part of your ecosystem. So, it allows you to diversify your traffic and not become reliant on just Instagram, just YouTube, just Pinterest or just your SEO because we can't change when things change on these different platforms, right?\
\
[00:18:08.180] - Meagan\
There's so much that's out of our control. But what you can do is host your most valuable content on your website and always bring things back.\
\
[00:18:16.440] - Meagan\
That if people like you. If they loved your idea pins to make sure that they follow you SEO, what I teach in my own programs and the people that I meet is that you should use idea pins to give people a taste of your content, to inspire them, to engage them through original video, original ideas, quick basic concepts. And then what you're going to do is you're going to grow your visibility by regularly publishing high quality idea pins, and then you're going to be putting out your regular content, your regular content marketing plan. And those are going to become vehicles for your standard pins or static pins and video pins.\
\
[00:18:57.900] - Meagan\
Now I'm going to give you a little insider scoop that video pins are still a capability as of the end of 2021. But heading into 2022, we might see them disappear or change into something else. Continue to use them while you can. We are going to be encouraged to put all video in our idea pins.\
\
[00:19:14.870] - Meagan\
Okay. So, for now, I want you to think about how video pins, an idea or standard pins or static pins will be your traffic drivers. So, you're going to use action oriented language. This is where if they see one of your idea pins, if they come to your feed, if they open up one of your boards, you're going to really lean heavily into using that standard content to drive action to your website. Your idea pins are going to be used for visibility and creating brand awareness and getting in front of your ideal reader or person who you want to see your products.\
\
[00:19:50.130] - Meagan\
If you're an affiliate or you sell products on your blog or website. And you want to use video pins while you can for visibility as well. Now, I know that on mobile, it is harder to click through, but it's not impossible. And the people that want to find your blog, that want to subscribe to your email list are still going to do that. But it's your responsibility as a storyteller to make sure you're extending that invitation. So, I talk a lot about using call to actions or call to values and making it super clear.\
\
[00:20:21.500] - Meagan\
Now what we've noticed is there's been a huge shift in how the machine learning and AI technology indexes content.\
\
[00:20:28.940] - Meagan\
So, these are some tips for you to make sure that you are really getting the most out of the platform. So, one you're going to want to show up consistently and you are going to think about what consistent means to you. So, the technology is smart enough that it will set a cadence or consistency for your account. So, say goodbye to like you should be doing X amount of pins or this of your own this of others. You're going to lean heavily into your own content.\
\
[00:20:59.220] - Meagan\
You're going to lean heavily into being original. So, your own messaging, your own. Take your own story, your own unique angle. Nobody wants you to pretend to be somebody you aren't. Okay. You are going to think about how you are going to do as many idea pins as possible to create visibility. And at the same time, you're going to engage in a holistic, high value content marketing strategy.\
\
[00:21:23.650] - Meagan\
That means that you're going to show up and share that new blog content to Pinterest on a regular basis. Now I get asked a lot. Can I use something like Tailwind? Can I use the Pinterest scheduler? Tailwind does have API.\
\
[00:21:35.930] - Meagan\
It is the most robust Pinterest scheduler out there, but there has been a lot of changes. You know there's been different complaints and gossip about Tailwind. What I want you to think about is what do you need to put in place to allow you to be consistent on the platform. So, if you want to set your schedule and walk away from it, then something like Tailwind will be really helpful. The Pinterest scheduler is great, but it only allows you to schedule two weeks at a time.\
\
[00:22:02.720] - Meagan\
I love, love, love, using manual pinning and the Pinterest scheduler. If you have lower volume content. Now, if you're more advanced and you do this as a full time gig, it will have its limitations. It gets harder and idea pins can be quite time consuming. Again, I want you to think about how you can repurpose your content in a purposeful way.\
\
[00:22:24.770] - Meagan\
So, thinking about the other vehicles for content. Where else are you creating video? So, are you making Instagram reels? Are you making Instagram stories? Tiktok?\
\
[00:22:34.350] - Meagan\
Are you do regular live video or YouTube videos? And could you edit those down and remove the watermarks and upload it to Pinterest? Now Pinterest knows that one use content is a hard sell, so they want you to think about how you can create content. And again, think about your workflow. What does that look like and then have it you know work for each platform. Now remember that some of the things that work on Instagram don't necessarily work on Pinterest, so adapt your content in a purposeful way.\
\
[00:23:04.830] - Meagan\
Remember people on Pinterest like fast, super helpful concise. And remember they're often looking for that basic tutorial. So, you might have this desire to make it super advanced, super complex. That is potentially enough content for ten idea pins versus one. Don't over complicate it.\
\
[00:23:24.230] - Meagan\
Now when you think about that plan, so you're working on your visibility, you're creating regular, fresh content. You can create pins for preexisting content for the upcoming seasons, and I encourage you to do that. But remember, there's this level of freshness. So, gold standard is new URL, new images, silver or the next down. The next tier is old preexisting URL new image, and then bronze is your preexisting content preexisting pins.\
\
[00:23:53.780] - Meagan\
Those are going to continue to die off and lose steam. So, they just aren't valued as much on Pinterest, and we don't want to engage in any repetitive pinning practices. So, think about how you can be consistent. Think about how you can begin to make idea pins part of your workflow? How you can invite your people to follow you? So that they see your standard pins. You're going to use video pins while you can.\
\
[00:24:17.160] - Meagan\
And I want to really encourage you to be continually updating your keyword research. So, as you make your way through the trends, really spend that time doing some extra research on your keywords and the categories with which that content falls into. Because if you aren't making it super clear and letting people identify your content. So, Pinterest has machine learning, so it has to identify. The AI technology has to identify what your content is about to show it to people. Right?\
\
[00:24:46.910] - Meagan\
So, if it's confused, it's not going to know who to show it to. So, make sure you're really thinking about that. You're doing research when you upload your idea pins. Remember that idea pins have tag categories, and that also tells you where to show that content. And you can actually leverage some of those tag categories as potential keyword phrases that you could be using for your standard content and your video content as well. So, you're going to be thinking about how you're optimizing your copy with keywords that are up to date and relevant for the season.\
\
[00:25:17.300] - Meagan\
You're going to be thinking about how to be consistent, whether that's using a scheduler or doing more manual pinning. You're going to be really thinking about how you can create amazing original idea pins that will give people everything they need to learn for that concept, but not invite them to leave the platform. Now you can do it in a tasteful way. I get asked all the time on client accounts. You know what's the product feature.\
\
[00:25:41.850] - Meagan\
But remember, good storytelling, good video is always going to perform and cut it up. You can cut it up into 20 sections. We know that five or more does best. We've seen single idea pins do really well as well. So, whatever you have, just get going.\
\
[00:25:59.160] - Meagan\
Don't let this hold you back. Remember, there are people on there that could be becoming part of your audience, diversify those traffic streams so that you could really be protecting your ideas. Your original content. Like you know what's the thing content is King. It's always going to do well if you have good content.\
\
[00:26:19.840] - Meagan\
So, if you're finding that your numbers are dropping, think about your fresh content. Think about the fact that maybe you can just retweet an idea. Look at your top performing content that you previously published. Use your Google analytics, use your Pinterest analytics and identify what is your top performing idea pin, how could you do a spin off of that? Why did that one perform so well?\
\
[00:26:41.620] - Meagan\
What board did you pin it to? What was your Pin text overlay? What was your Pin title? Remember, Pin titles are incredibly important. Again, they're indexed by Pinterest to understand what the content is about.\
\
[00:26:54.530] - Meagan\
So, really think about your Pin title, that text overlay. And as a search engine, make it easy for Pinterest to understand. Now what we actually know is that Pinterest is now and there were some glitches involving Pinterest profiles is that they are now showing recommended profiles in the search bar and making it really easy when people are logged into the app or on desktop to follow. So, make sure that your bio is up to date and includes the most relevant keywords for you, your niche or industry, whatever you create content about. So that you could be the recommended person for Gluten free recipes, for Montessori style activities, for travel in Peru.\
\
[00:27:37.000] - Meagan\
You want to really think about how you can be optimizing it and making it a no brainer for Pinterest to want to recommend you because that's just going to help you get in front of more people. We've seen incredible success.\
\
[00:27:48.970] - Meagan\
You know people go from under 100 followers to 60,000. We have a person in my membership that has actually done that through creating idea Pins on a regular basis and that type of growth is possible for you as well. You just really have to think about how you can come to the platform in a valuable, original way and not just copy what other people are doing. They want you to lean into who you are. If you've read there's a creator's code, you can look that up and what they really want to do is foster people who maybe feel frustrated by other platforms but feel throttled by reach.\
\
[00:28:23.150] - Meagan\
That Pinterest is the place for you to diversify your traffic to get in front of, grow your audience, get in front of more people. And they're calling it to Pinterest 2.0. So, I hope that you found this valuable. I would love to see you go out and create an idea Pin for a blog post that has done really well in the past for you. Or maybe you're going to go out and do some updated keyword research and help go back and further optimize your boards and your profile so that you become a recommended account.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.890] - Nadalie\
Hey there, blogging breakthrough people. It's Nadalie Bardo, your Pinterest. coach here. I'm really excited that you joined.\
\
[00:00:20.030] - Nadalie\
This is my favorite training ever. It's going to make Pinterest super simple and clear for you. Driving traffic to your blog or your business or your shop will never be easier. So, how about we start the class? This is the crazy simple way to get loads of Pinterest traffic. Ready to stop stressing out about finding more leads for your business. To quit worrying about how to actually get more traffic?\
\
[00:00:51.170] - Nadalie\
To create a crazy simple strategy for increasing traffic, subscribers and sales. Well, let's be honest, those are the three things we care about most. If so, let's do it. So, hey, all. I'm Nadalie Bardo.\
\
[00:01:07.360] - Nadalie\
I'm here to help you launch and level up your traffic with Pinterest. As a Pinterest coach, I'm dedicated to helping blogs, businesses, and brands just like yours achieve their goals of more traffic, more subscribers, and more sales with Pinterest. So, what if you could 3X your traffic? How about 5X it in just a few months? You can with Pinterest if you know how.\
\
[00:01:35.870] - Nadalie\
This is just a snapshot of the potential power of Pinterest. This is the day I started pinning everything changed for me. Maybe you think right now that Pinterest is a social media site. You might not know that Pinterest is a visual search engine and that there are over 5 billion monthly searches on Pinterest and over 400 million active monthly users on Pinterest. But did you know that Pinterest users are more likely to purchase from you than users on other platforms?\
\
[00:02:10.930] - Nadalie\
Or that 75% of weekly Pinterest users say they're always shopping? Okay, that's the mindset of Pinterest users and that Pinterest searches are seasonally driven and that the simplest way to get traffic is by making your content timely, or that your success on Pinterest starts before you even create a pin. Did you know that? There are two types of content you can create. On one hand, we've got nevergreen. You've heard of evergreen content?\
\
[00:02:44.240] - Nadalie\
To me, it's never green content, doesn't really bring you that much money. That gets a low but steady search volume. So, search volume just refers to the average monthly number of users who are searching for a particular keyword versus steaming hot seasonal content that gets a massive boost in search volume because so many people are searching for these answers at the exact same time. So, let me know, which type of content are you creating for your business or for your blog?\
\
[00:03:15.390] - Nadalie\
Nevergreen or seasonal? Have you been making only nevergreen content? Are you missing out on this massive source of monthly traffic? If you're feeling like this right now, don't worry. The solution is simple. You're going to know the season you're in, know what people are interested in and when, and then create it right?\
\
[00:03:40.700] - Nadalie\
If we break down any Pinterest strategy, this is the core of it. And you're going to get pinning. So, what does this look like? How do you plan for this? You're going to pin by the seasons of your main audience, which is likely the USA.\
\
[00:03:55.360] - Nadalie\
So, for example, I'm based in Canada, but the majority of my audience is from the US. Where is your audience from? You're going to pin based on their seasons. So, we got winter, December to February, spring, March to May, summer, June to August, and autumn or fall, September to November. You know the seasons, right?\
\
[00:04:16.980] - Nadalie\
But with one major catch, you're going to start pinning 45 days before. So, if we're talking Thanksgiving, that's October 12. Christmas, November 10, New Year's, November 16. Valentine's Day, January 1st, Easter, February 23rd. So, these are those major US holidays, right?\
\
[00:04:39.530] - Nadalie\
You're going to count backwards 45 days, back it up. So, even better, if you can do 60 to 90 days ahead of time, this is going to help you to get more traffic. So, if we're just looking at those holidays, you can see right here, we are just going to back it up 60 or 90 days. So, here's an example. You know we'll take you all the way to the end of the year.\
\
[00:05:04.450] - Nadalie\
New Year's Eve is December 31st. So, let's count back 45, 60, and 90 days. So, here's just a calendar. We've got December 31, which is our big day. We'll count backwards 45 days, takes us to November 16th. We'll count back more 60 days, November 1st. And then 90 days brings us to October 2nd. So, here's just a look at a trend graph. In case you've never seen one before, I always say it's your new best friend.\
\
[00:05:36.040] - Nadalie\
This trend graph is showing you when particular keyword traffic spikes, right? So, you can access this with a Pinterest business account that's free of charge. You click on analytics and then trends, and this is where it takes you. So right here, this is 45 days out, November 16th We can see if we go over to Google trends, which is the OG trends tool, which is around long before Pinterest trends came about.\
\
[00:06:02.480] - Nadalie\
If you can't find information on your keyword in Pinterest trends, I encourage you to check out Google trends because they line up almost perfectly. So, this is the trend that we see in Pinterest. And now I'm going to flip over to Google, and you can see that it pretty much starts taking off on the same day, 45 days out. Okay, right here. So, you might be wondering, why so early?\
\
[00:06:25.560] - Nadalie\
Why 45 or more days? Okay, it can take three plus weeks for your pins to be indexed. That means three plus weeks for Pinterest to categorize your pins, and three plus weeks for your Pin to even be found in search. So, let's take a look at that. Let's take a closer look at that New Year's Eve. So, I've laid out all the days for you. We've got the big day, 45 60, 90 days out. Okay? Right here.\
\
[00:06:55.500] - Nadalie\
Consider this the time it takes to be indexed. So, what would happen if you waited too late to publish this content? Right? This is our big day. If you waited too late, you would completely miss all the traffic for this holiday.\
\
[00:07:11.680] - Nadalie\
That's why we want to get started ideally, 60 to 90 days before, you don't want to miss the traffic. Okay? This is why it's so important to get started early. You get started early to get all the traffic.\
\
[00:07:25.670] - Nadalie\
You get the take off, the peak and the fall, as opposed to missing it all. So, quick pop quiz to make sure you've been paying attention. I want you to point to the screen when you should get started with this keyword. Okay? So when would you get started? I'll give you a few more seconds to decide.\
\
[00:07:44.930] - Nadalie\
Are you pointing okay. Right here, that's where you should get started. 90 days out, ideally. Okay, remember, time to be indexed. So, you might be wondering, is this just for holidays?\
\
[00:07:56.960] - Nadalie\
Like, what if I can't think of holiday content? It's not relevant to my business, right? You got to think trendy instead. Trends come and go. You got to think timely instead.\
\
[00:08:09.300] - Nadalie\
All right? So ask yourself questions like, what would my customers be interested in during this month? March, April, May, June, July, August, September? Dive deep into these months. What's going on in their lives?\
\
[00:08:22.930] - Nadalie\
What challenges, problems, questions, or concerns would they have in insert season here? Okay. I want you to think about it. Think about what they need. What are the solutions you have? So, when we're thinking trendy and timely content, there's always a best time to promote a certain piece of content.\
\
[00:08:43.180] - Nadalie\
And when I use the word content, it could be a blog post, a product, a pin, a podcast episode, a video, whatever it is you're creating. You just have to figure out when that is. That's why these trend graphs are so helpful. So, you can check tools like Pinterest trends, pinterest 100, Pinterest Predicts, Google trends, or your analytics. It's just not your first year of business.\
\
[00:09:08.750] - Nadalie\
What were people interested in a year ago? You have the data. Are you using it? Check your Pinterest, check your Google and your Tailwind analytics if you're using it. What were people interested in and when?\
\
[00:09:23.810] - Nadalie\
When, you got to figure out this. When is the best time to share this content? And what will Pinners be interested in on X date? Then you can do your research, and you can plan. You can plan ahead.\
\
[00:09:35.080] - Nadalie\
You can plan the whole year of content. So, let's go through those steps. Step one, you're going to choose your keyword phrase. So, select a relevant keyword phrase that's three to five words in length and in season in the next 60 to 90 days. We want to go after a phrase because that you can actually rank for and be found in search results.\
\
[00:09:55.550] - Nadalie\
For example, if you are just going to search business, it's a keyword, but it's more or less just a word. There's millions of results, but if you're doing how to start a business with no money, that's a phrase you can rank for. So, for example, I'm typing in spring, you can see some things come up in Pinterest trends. Also using the search bar, you'll see my search query results also have some search volumes right beside it. That's because I have the keywords everywhere plugin installed.\
\
[00:10:24.970] - Nadalie\
It shows you the search volume for Google in any search bar. So, this also shows up data for like YouTube and on Amazon. So, it's very helpful. Also you can check out Google trends. So, you want to remember, even nevergreen keywords are most likely seasonal.\
\
[00:10:41.380] - Nadalie\
You could think, oh no, there's no way this is a seasonal keyword. But you do your research and you realize that almost every keyword has a spike. So, for example, start a business. This peaks in January. There are so many keywords that have peaks where you think, okay, this would be any time of year, this is relevant.\
\
[00:10:59.130] - Nadalie\
But you want to time yourself with these waves, so you can get that huge boost, that boost of traffic that trickles into subscribers and sales and ad income and affiliate income and all that good stuff. Okay? It's a seasonal keyword phrase. So, step two, you're going to go create your content. Remember, content refers to anything you're creating, blog posts, products, podcast episode.\
\
[00:11:22.310] - Nadalie\
So, you're going to write a blog post, film a YouTube video, record a podcast episode, or create a product page and hit publish. You're going to add your main keyword phrase to your content's, title, link and image. So, we've got right here, ways to find your purpose in life, title, link, and also your image. I also just cut all my feature images and make those as my pin. That's just a way to streamline my image creation.\
\
[00:11:49.750] - Nadalie\
I suggest you do something similar. And then remember when we're using these keywords, you can also search and see right down below all the results that come up for these types of keywords. So ,here are just some examples of the type of content that you can be creating. Get creative, right? You can create blog posts, list-type posts, videos. There's so much you can do for any type of keyword.\
\
[00:12:15.590] - Nadalie\
So, for example, here are some examples of content that was created for that keyword of business. It can be an image pin, it could be a video pin, right? You can have shorter pins, longer pins. There's so many types of pins you can create. And speaking of pins, you're going to design multiple pins per post or per link.\
\
[00:12:34.800] - Nadalie\
So, create three to five pinterest pins with your keyword phrase front and center. Make them different and distinct. So, for example, here's a static pin. You could also create video pins. You can also make idea pins.\
\
[00:12:48.130] - Nadalie\
These are the types of pins. They're like carousels. You can click through them. They've got multiple pages. So, these are three styles of pins you can create.\
\
[00:12:57.420] - Nadalie\
And here are some other examples, static, video, and then an idea pin. Okay? So don't just create one type or style of Pin. Make sure you're making use of all of the tools that are available to you.\
\
[00:13:09.840] - Nadalie\
And this is just another form of pin. So, you might be wondering, it's not a lot of work, Nadalie like I don't know if I want to do all that. But here's a pro tip. Use canva pin templates that convert.\
\
[00:13:20.260] - Nadalie\
This is going to save you so much time and make it easier. So, save time by creating and customized pins in an easy to use graphic design tool like canva. Get started for free. You don't need to pay anything, especially if you're creating your own images like photos and videos. You don't need to use their stock library. You can just upload your own images.\
\
[00:13:42.910] - Nadalie\
So, don't start from scratch with every pin. Just swap in the new text and update the images anytime you're creating content. So, for example, here are some of Carly's pins. One post, second post, third post. Okay? They're the same templates.\
\
[00:14:00.480] - Nadalie\
She just changes the text and updates the images. Here are a few more examples. Right. Kayla over at writing from nowhere. These are her pin templates.\
\
[00:14:09.030] - Nadalie\
All she does is update the images and change the text. This is how you save time. So, you have your pins. Now it's time for step four, you're going to save those pins to Pinterest.\
\
[00:14:20.220] - Nadalie\
So, you're going to add your pins to Pinterest in real time or schedule them with a tool like Tailwind. So, be sure to SEO your pin titles and descriptions with your chosen keyword phrase. Remember that keyword phrase we found? So you're going to add it to the title, add it to your description, add it to your website link. We did that.\
\
[00:14:39.360] - Nadalie\
Add it to your image and to your alt text, which is simply, in case the image doesn't load or they're using a screen reader, you know visually impaired is able to understand what your content is about, and you're going to save that to a relevant board. So, this is a post on meditation. It's saved to a meditation and mindfulness board. We're checking all the boxes, helping Pinterest to understand what our content is about.\
\
[00:15:02.430] - Nadalie\
But here's a warning. I encourage you to wait seven days or more to save the same link to Pinterest again. So, yes, we designed multiple pins. But wait a week before you share that same link again. Just allow your pins that space to breathe.\
\
[00:15:17.910] - Nadalie\
So, maybe on week one, you put this pin, and then week two, and then week three, we're leading all the way up to spring. Week four, week five. Here are just some pins that I've created for one piece of content over the years. Week seven, here's another. Week eight, every year, I just design new pin templates.\
\
[00:15:36.070] - Nadalie\
And then you continue pinning until the big day. That's it. And then you rinse and repeat with every season. So, say you created seasonal content for this year. Next year, update it and keep sharing it with new pins.\
\
[00:15:49.540] - Nadalie\
You're going to update posts and build on your content yearly. Create content for the seasons. This is how you're going to grow. Not sure where to start? How about we brainstorm some ideas together?\
\
[00:16:00.980] - Nadalie\
So, let's talk about the big ones. The big niches, or as Pinterest calls them, categories of content. So if you're in blog or business, you could do spring cleaning your biz, surviving summer slumps we all know what that is, right?\
\
[00:16:14.980] - Nadalie\
Back to school promotions or back to business, right? That's huge in September. Black Friday deals, huge for business. Holiday deals and promotions.\
\

How to run them, what the best ones are. You do lifestyle and home decor. Spring cleaning and decluttering. Summer parties and barbecues. Back to school is huge.\

Saving up for summer vacations, road trips, those types of ideas. Paying for events, weddings, anniversaries, baptisms, whatever. Think about it. Graduation, holiday parties on a budget.\
\
[00:18:10.990] - Nadalie\
So, you might be wondering, does seasonal content really make a difference? Like does this work? Can pinterest traffic be that crazy simple? I have receipts, as they say. So here's just a look at multiple events where seasonal traffic has spiked my business.\
\
[00:18:29.040] - Nadalie\
Okay, so you can see these big spikes. That's seasonal content. So, you see it over on Pinterest. It ripples to my subscribers. It ripples to my income, right?\
\
[00:18:41.580] - Nadalie\
These all line up perfectly. And it goes beyond pinterest traffic. I get a huge spike in Google organic search traffic. These all line up identically. And it's not just for the big day.\
\
[00:18:53.600] - Nadalie\
You get a spike in the lead up, the big day and the fall off. And imagine if you had a spike every single month. And here's just another snapshot, some more spikes in my traffic. If you could 3x, 5x or 10x your traffic and your subscribers and your sales along with them.\
\
[00:19:14.190] - Nadalie\
Here's just another snapshot of a few months, spikes, spikes, spikes. But before you go, if you got questions about what to do and what not to do on Pinterest, not quite ready to take on Pinterest. Feeling like this? I got you.\
\
[00:19:28.810] - Nadalie\
So hold up. Here's a few simple rules to follow, what not to do. Okay? Rule number one, do not repent the same pin. Create a fresh pin, optimize it to the nine, pin it to the best boards, then move on. Go create a new pin.\
\
[00:19:44.130] - Nadalie\
Do not repin. Rule two, no need to use group boards. This is no longer a beneficial strategy. Save your time and energy. Focus on your own boards.\
\
[00:19:55.560] - Nadalie\
Rule three quit focusing on other people's pins so much. It's all about you, all about your content, your front and center. Rule four, do not skip SEO steps. Okay? SEO is important.\
\
[00:20:09.360] - Nadalie\
We started with choosing our keyword. Make sure you check every box and take it all the way to when you hit save or pin on pinterest. Rule five, do not do too much at once. Take it slow, okay? Don't save 100 pins in a day.\
\
[00:20:23.590] - Nadalie\
You might set off some spam alerts, and you don't want to make sure that, you know your account doesn't end up in Pinterest's bad graces, okay? So avoid doing that, okay? Feeling a little better. Anything else? Well, I'm glad you asked.\
\
[00:20:39.920] - Nadalie\
Here's what to do. Keep things positive is rule number one. Okay? So, negative topics, hateful topics, you know, things like politics do not belong on pinterest. It's not a place to argue.\
\
[00:20:54.570] - Nadalie\
It is a place to inspire. Okay? Keep things positive. Two, fresh pIns only, right? We're not repinning. \
\
[00:21:03.960] - Nadalie\
We're creating new pins for our content. So, focus on keeping it fresh. And your freshest piece of pin, your freshest piece of pin, your freshest pin is going to be linking to your freshest content, which just means new content, right? So keep creating new links to be successful on pinterest, you need to have multiple links.\
\
[00:21:25.350] - Nadalie\
And rule three, design different pins. Your pin should all not look identical, okay? It can be come across as spammy if every single pin is just slightly different. So, just design different pins. Experiment.\
\
[00:21:39.570] - Nadalie\
Rule four, just be consistent. Get started. Keep showing up. Keep going. No taking your foot off the gas.\
\
[00:21:48.040] - Nadalie\
And even if that means just pinning one pin a day, start with that, commit to that, and stay consistent with that. Rule five, set realistic expectations for yourself. Okay? Pinterest is a long term strategy. Yes, you can 3X to your traffic with seasonal content.\
\
[00:22:05.260] - Nadalie\
It works, okay? But understand that there might be a learning curve, that it might not hit a home run the first time you do it, but you just got to stay consistent with it and just set realistic expectations for yourself and just commit. It's a long-term strategy and see it through. Okay. So, Pinterest, you'll definitely most likely see results in a few months. Things should start head in the positive direction.\
