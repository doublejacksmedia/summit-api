Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright. Emma, thank you so much for joining us today. I really appreciate you taking the time. Oh, I'm so excited to be here. Thank you for inviting me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:06]:
Yes. No. I've been a fan of yours for a long time. I can't even remember. first came across you, but you're, like, in my mind, you're, like, copywriting pro. I feel like it must've been in another summit or Ultimate Bundles or something. I don't know. But I feel like I'm gonna wear it for a really long time. I'm so excited that you were able to join the summit too. So today, you're gonna be talking about sales paid at me because, obviously, you know, as bloggers, we tend to think about content and stuff, but eventually, it gets to the point where you're selling product. and doing a sales page. You know, it's a whole another, like, set of skills.

Emma Lee Bates [00:00:39]:
It really is. Yeah. I see so many bloggers who think, like, they can just take their skills, writing blog posts, and transfer it to a sales page, and it really is a completely different animal.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:49]:
It is. Yeah. because I it's something I struggle with. And so I'm I'm getting all these people on the summit that I can then learn from. But, yeah, so can you tell us a little bit kind of what you're gonna be covering in your session today or time an anatomy of sales page. Can you just kind of break down some of the the top points you'll be covering?

Emma Lee Bates [00:01:06]:
Yeah. So I I really I focus a lot above the fold and what should be immediately visible when people land on your page. and I give a bunch of examples at the end. So make sure you stick around because I do go through some other people's sales pages and, landing pages that I really like and think they've done a good job. so it's a great way to sort of have a template to start with if you have one that you really like. And, Yeah. So so those are sort of the main things we go over.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:36]:
Awesome. Well, I'm super excited to to go ahead and get started.

Emma Lee Bates [00:01:39]:
Alright. Thanks. Welcome. I am Emma Lee Bates, and this is my talk anatomy of a high converting sales page. Many people ask me, how do you know what is high converting? What conversion rate should you be aiming for, and how do you even figure it out? A sales page, trip wire page, should be getting a 3 to 5% average conversion rate. Something like your freebie page is going to be much higher. You can aim for something like 60 to 70%. but for a sales page, 3-5% is average. It does depend on your industry and your traffic. So your industry, something like a high end electronic company is going to have a different aid online gift shop. Why? Because when you're purchasing high end electronics, you're gonna do research. You're going to look around about at different reviews, and it's going to be something that you've put some thought into. So when you land on the page, you're gonna be ready to buy more likely than not. An online gift shop is something that you might browse. You're gonna buy if something catches your eye or maybe, you know, if there's a holiday coming up and you know, you need to get something but it's not something that you're really gonna research beforehand. It's not something that, is going to be a pre sought out purchase in most cases. Your traffic is also gonna be a big consideration. If you are sending an email sequence to your list of email fans and they're engaged and They know who you are, you're gonna have a higher conversion rate than cold traffic from Facebook ads. People who know you already have that no like and trust factor, whereas cold traffic, they are gonna be a little more hesitant. They are going to want to, you know, maybe they're gonna Google you to see who you are before they buy. Alright. So the basic anatomy of a sales page. This is a simple sales page template that I put together. starts with your headline and a buy button and moves into fears and desires, talking directly to your ideal customer about what they are experiencing right now and what they'd like to experience after solving that problem. then there's another buy button with an urgency timer. You know, that that's a, optional thing, but it can help if you have a open close cart to let people know that there is a deadline. then you're going to say you're, you know, welcome to what the product is. You're gonna give a brief overview. You're gonna talk about the benefits, and then you can go into some content bullet points. After that, you wanna make sure you have some testimonials, photos of maybe the product, or people using the product. then it's great to have some results, whether it's you know, more testimonials, a case study, then you can have an about me section, another testimonial, and then finally your buy button and urgency timer at the end of the page. This is just sort of a basic sales page, but it shows you sort of the different sections that I might usually use. Also, we're gonna be talking about the, that above the fold section of your sales page. And on this, it would be from the headline down to the urgency timer. That would probably be above your fold. Alright. So your headline, an attention grabbing headline that encourages them to keep reading. Alright. sometimes you might have a headline that is the name of the course of product and then a subheading that encourages you to keep reading, but you wanna make sure that the top of your page compels them to keep reading. So you want to make your headline really interesting. You wanna be talking to your ideal customer. It's great to touch upon a pain point I like to ask a question a lot. It makes people stop and think because they need to close that that open loop when there's a question asked of them. Powerwords are really great to use in headlines. If you Google Powerwords, there are lists of, like, you know, 800 power words you can use. So, you know, take a look at those and and choose some that are your favorites, some that would really appeal to your ideal customer. and use those in your headlines or subheadings. And then this is my biggest tip. Don't stop at one headline. Brainstorm

Emma Lee Bates [00:05:48]:
20 to 30 headlines. Just keep writing them out. You know, maybe you're just changing 1 or 2 words. Maybe you're trying. asking a question, you're trying, you know, a formula, you're focusing on a fear, you're focusing on a desire, but really write on a whole bunch of headlines and then figure out which one you like best. Maybe you combine a couple. Maybe you have, you know, what is a headline? What is the subheading? But it's gonna get a much better result if you take the time to really brainstorm a whole bunch of ideas. The next section we're gonna talk about is the above the fold section. there are three things that you wanna make sure are answered above the fold. What it is, who it's for, and a way to buy it. Alright. So what it is, make sure people can tell right away. You know, is this a service, an ebook, a course? What is it people are gonna land on your page sometimes, and they really they're not gonna know who you are. They're not gonna know the types of things you offer. So make it pretty obvious, you know, what it is that you are selling and what it will do for them. So how will it make their life easier? This is those fears and desires I was talking about. You know, if you focus on where they are now and then talk about where they could be after using your product or service, that's gonna really help them understand how this product is important for them to consider buying. The other thing is who is it for? The number of times I've landed on a page and start reading and be like, I have no idea whether this is something for me or not. Make it really obvious. It doesn't have to be like, you know, this is for virtual assistants. You don't have to make it that obvious, but using language that virtual assistants would know or using you know, references to the work at home life or, some way that people are going to start getting the idea whether or not this is for them. And then finally, I know some people say you shouldn't put a button until further down the page so people read, but so often people are coming to your page, you know, Either they're intrigued and they wanna know exactly, you know, how much this costs, whether this is something they can afford, or they would like you know, they've already been convinced that, you know, they love you, they wanna buy your next thing, and you don't wanna have to make them scroll and scroll and scroll to buy it. So I always say put a button above the fold so that people who are ready to buy can buy right away. Alright. So the next thing to talk about is social proof. This needs to be on every sales page. I'll even put social proof on landing pages for free products sometimes. The more people can see that you are a real person who helps people, the better off you are. So ways you can put social proof in, there are, of course, like, apps that you can add to different types of sites that will put a little pop up in the bottom corner that says, you know, so and so bot or so and so join the list. but you don't have to, like, invest in one of those. Get some testimonials. People who have worked with you I mean, I know I do it for people all the time. I love to provide a testimonial if I if somebody has helped me or, you know, provided me with excellent service. So don't be afraid to reach out to people that, you know, worked with you or studied, you know, your courses are material before. The, the thing people ask a lot is if you are releasing a new product? How do you get testimonials or reviews? Do a beta launch. having that feedback before you do a major launch is really important, not just for getting testimonials, but also to make sure you've worked out the kinks, you know, I mean, you're gonna launch stuff and there's gonna be there's gonna be stuff people don't understand. And if you do a beta launch and you take the time to make it really, really good, you're gonna get better results overall. I do believe that beta launches should be paid because people invest in the things, mentally that they've invested in financially. So, you know, it doesn't have to be a ton of money, but definitely a paid beta launch is gonna get you the best, testimonials and reviews. So testimonials is gonna be something the customer write and provides to you. A review could be something that they post on Facebook, they do in a blog post, or, you know, some something like that. So they are, similar, but a review can be more of a public thing than a testimonial might be. make sure you ask people before you put them on your page I know there are some templates out there to get a, like, a testimonial re testimonial release form. You could do that if you feel you need to be protected. but they are, you know, really great for a sales page. It really helps bring in that social proof. A couple of other things that you can do is a case study. So if you have somebody you've worked with and you have the ability to screenshot, you know, maybe their sign ups increased or their subscribers or they made more money. If you have some sort of, visual that you can screenshot and share on the page, that can be really powerful, especially if you can write up a you know, a story about where they were and you worked with them and then hear some proof on the changes that happened for them. And then lastly, a personal experience Be careful not to put this too close to the top of the page. You want it down a little bit. The top of the page should really focus on who the reader is and what their experience will be like. You wanna talk about their fears and desires. But further down, you can talk about your own experience, you can tell your story, you can tell how you developed this, or you know, how you finally dive in to learn what it is you learn and you can really, you know, tell that story as a a strong suggestion that you know what you're talking about. One of the places I really see a lot of people struggle on their sales page is bullet points. So I wanted to take a few minutes and go over the benefits of bullet points and how to write better ones. the first thing to know about bullet points is you need them. They make a sales page really easy to scan. A lot of people will stop and look at bullet points because they're usually kind of short to the point, they can get something out of it. And then if they're interested, they'll go back and read longer paragraphs. So you definitely wanna have multiple places where you have bullet points on your page. They are, as I said, easy to read. They highlight benefits and they create a break for the eye. The best bullet points create an open loop for the reader. An open loop is a question that the mind naturally longs to answer. one of the reasons that I ask questions in the headline because it is something that people naturally want to finish. When a bullet point is well written, it answers one question and brings up a second, or it creates curiosity about how something is possible. A few types of bullet points, the 2 step bullet point, an elaboration on the main benefit, and I'll tell you all I'm gonna show you again at the end what I'm talking about, but all of these bullet points came from one of my very favorite copywriting books called, how to write copy that converts by Ray Edwards. so you should look that up if you wanna get better at bullet points. Okay. So the 2 step bullet point. An example would be how to create standard operating procedures in your business. Parenthesis, you've been wasting time, energy, and money doing it wrong. Okay. So it's telling you a feature, right, how to create standard operating procedures. And then it's telling you something that is sort of a hint as to what you might learn inside. It's creating an open loop, you know, because you ask yourself, what am I doing wrong? I thought I was doing this. Right? What am I missing? So it creates a little intrigue. It creates some curiosity about what is inside. So this is the first type of bullet point that I love. The second type is the single most bullet point. This can be used when you have proven results. So if you have something with a case study that has proved your you know, your point or, something that's been tested, you can say something like the single most effective way to appear powerful on camera, tested by Harvard University. you know, in this case, that's a big name, Harvard University. So people are gonna know what that is, but it doesn't necessarily have to be something that sort of intense. It could be, you know, tested by my previous students, and then you show the proof, you know, you show them screenshots and case studies and that type of stuff. But it is a great way to give, a lot of power to what you're teaching or sharing. Alright. The next type of bullet point I really love is the how to bullet point. It's simple, but you need to make sure to include why the reader should care. So this is what I was talking about before with features and benefits when you want to tell them what it is and why should they should care. For example, how to quickly grow your Facebook book group with true fans. Okay. Why they should care is so you can explode your income. Things that people care about most are saving time, saving money, and making money, things that are basic needs, especially, you know, in real life, you know, finding food, finding relationships, that type of thing. The last one I have here is called is an the number bullet point. When you show multiple ways of doing something or multiple reasons why. So this would be, like, the 3 most important reasons that you need to plan before you launch your next product. So, you know, this can be the 3 most important mistakes, you know, or the 3 most common mistakes that people make in real estate. It could be the 3 most, devastating, you know, examples of people not following, you know, my, method type of thing. But you use a number, they say that using odd numbers is better. So, like, 5, 7, 9

Emma Lee Bates [00:15:46]:
but it really, you know, a number is powerful. A list is powerful. This is why places like Buzzfeed, you know, make a killing because they are all listicles and people are attracted to that. Okay. So you need to use different kinds of bullet points. You wanna use a group of bullet points to be you want a group of bullet points to be related by topic. You you but use a variety of types of bullet points to keep people interested in what you are saying. So you don't wanna have, you know, 5 bullet points all starting with the 3 most, the 5 most, the 7 most. You know, that's boring. That's not mixing it up. You wanna make sure that your group of bullet points has diversity. Practice. Practice practice. Practice. Just like the headlines, you wanna write out a lot of bullet points. you know, keep writing them down. When I sit down to write a sales page, you know, I'll start with a whole bunch of bullet points, and keep adding to them as I go and then, you know, mix them up and try to figure out where they go on the page. I usually have a features and benefits section. You might have, you know, a section with what's included. you know, you can have a section with the, you know, the biggest benefits for people or, you know, things that your students or clients did after they worked with you, all sorts of different types of bullet points are really good to include, and it's good to use an odd number of bullet points in each group. Alright. So How to Write Copy that Sells by Ray Edwards is where I got all these bullet going tips. He has I think over 20 types of bullet points in that book, and it is really, like, I go back and reference it all the time. It's my very favorite. So if you wanna write better bullet points, then definitely check out that section of his book. So next up is the journey. This is gonna take your customers from where they are now to where they could be after purchasing your offer. You wanna focus on the transformation for them. This is that, you know, this is where you are right now, and I would like to take you to this place. So it is a talking about the, features and benefits of your, product or service. this is, I like to think of it as what it is and why they should care. So if you list something like they're gonna get a workbook, then you would say, you know, 80 page workbook so that you can practice all of the techniques that I have taught you in the course. You wanna tell them exactly why this is gonna benefit them by telling, you know, by having that because so that and then focus on them. use language in terms that help them self identify. I talked a little bit about the focus on using words so they know whether it is for them. And this is the same type of thing. You want to focus on words that they're gonna relate to, terms that they're gonna relate to, If you have been in your niche, a long time, it can be hard to go back to the beginning. And so when you are writing your sales page, it can be really helpful to identify some people who are in that early stage that you can talk to, you know, reach out and say, hey, can we just get on a coffee chat? I'd love to kind of you know, figure out what terms that you're using to describe things. It's a great way to make sure that you are meeting them where they are and not using language that you know, but they are gonna be confused. And then finally, in your personal experience, in your about section, you know, your bio towards the end of the page, really share how your life story is, changed by what you learned or, you know, what you're teaching. So, you know, talk about your story in terms of how your life has changed on this topic. It's I'm being general, so it's a lot to figure out how to how to word that. But you don't wanna just say, you know, Emma Bates lives in New Hampshire with 3 kids, you wanna say, Emma Bates finally got tired of trying to write copy that converts, and she invested in a copywriting coach. I'll show you my bio in a little bit. Alright. So let's jump into some examples. Alright. This first one is from my trip wire page. This page converts at about 10%. So it's got a really good conversion rating. I do start with the title of the product. It is a bundle of 3 products. There's a picture right there of it. And then I talk about it's a quick and dirty guide to building your 1st or next sales page. So this is gonna show you, you know, what it is. It's gonna show you how it can help you. You know, I'm talking about your your struggles. Do you struggle the right sales pages that make sense? constantly questioning your copy. Then I tell you how I'm gonna solve it. You know, it's it's gonna have, you're getting this discount and you're gonna get this bundle of stuff that's gonna help you. Alright. So this is from Monica Froese. It's her pin pin practical promotions primer. I really like this because she tells you exactly what this is. It's a 40 page promoted Pins primer, and it is a step by step guide for profitable promoted pins. So you know exactly what this is. You know, there is no question. It is a step by step guide. You're talking about promoted pins. You know, it's forty pages. You know exactly what you're getting. This is from Lauren at, Financial Best Life. This is for her workbook. I really like this headline. Set big goals with this free workbook. So you know right away. Okay. I'm I'm setting goals. You're on a financial site. And so you know, these are gonna bite financial goals, life goals. and then, you know, it gets down into the nitty gritty. you know, once you fill up this workbook, you'll know what steps to take to make a difference in your life. That, you know, that's a big selling point for people. Alright. This one I love, this is from Rosemarie Groner, and I think her headline is genius. Your decision in the next forty 2 seconds is critical. I mean, like, how much drama is that? I think it's so great because, I mean, you read that and you're like, oh my god. I gotta know, what am I deciding? You know, what is what is so important on this page? And, you know, then she dives right in, free access, easy to implement budgeting system. I mean, I know exactly what it is. She thinks it's a big deal, and I gotta make a decision. So, you know, Okay. I'm gonna press that free instant access button. Here is the bio that I was talking about. So you know, this is on my course page and then talk about, I finally got fed up with being afraid to write sales copy. I hired a copywriting coach and worked hard for 3 months until it finally clicked. This is how I sort of became the expert in what I could, you know, present here. point of my bio is to introduce people to the fact that I have been where they are. I struggled. I found a way to learn what I needed to learn, and now I'd like to help them. And then at the end, you know, I tack on. I have 3 kids and I run an online business, but the point of my about section is really how I can help other people. Alright. And then here is a section from Stupid Simple SEO where he has some great, testimonials. So, you know, he's got the person's picture, a great, very succinct quote from them, you know, hands down one of the best deep dives SEO courses I have seen. It's full of information. I haven't seen anyone else talk about. You know, I mean, that one sentence, but it's a great review. And he's made it really clear that these are real people, you know, that he's got a picture, and then he's got their business name. This is another way that you could do social proof. This is from April Lewis. She screenshots. Facebook posts and, Facebook messages and she puts them on her sales page. You can really see exactly, you know, peep what people are saying. It's not, like, generically, she's got their names and stuff, but, you know, it gives you a really clear idea of what people say about her. Okay. So then the last thing I want to talk about is conversion conversion copywriting. how do you move from knowing your ideal customer to writing to your ideal customer? Is sales copy different than writing a blog post or email? The answer is yes. sales copy is a really different animal. And the the fact that you can write doesn't mean that you know how to write sales copy. You can learn it, obviously. I mean, it's not hard, but it is very different than writing to share information, writing to encourage people to buy takes, a different focus. So I'm going to go over a little bit of that right now. Yes. Okay. So how is sales copy different, and how do you know what to write? First of all, it's all about them. The biggest mistake that I see when people sit down to write a landing page, sales page, trip wire page, even a sales email is that they write about themselves. And that's natural. I mean, you know, we as humans are concerned about ourselves, most of all. But The sales page needs to convince somebody else to buy, which means you need to make it all about them. Don't write your own story near the top of the page. It's okay to include it further down, but you wanna take the top of the page and really focus on the reader. So you wanna write about their fears and desires. You wanna write about their transformation that's possible. You wanna write about their journey. You need to write what they want to hear. Okay. Next is focus on transformation. How will your product or service help them? This is where you really need to write about what is possible with your service or your program. What is the end result gonna be? You need to focus on it in a really positive way. don't use language that justifies. you don't wanna be, like, justifying, justifying your price or anything like that. You really wanna be focused on how their lives will be better after they go through your product, your service, whatever it is. Use social proof. Like I said, testimonials, case studies, stories, things that have, proof that is from other people is really important. Anything that you can do to increase your reader's trust in you on a sales page and having other people vouch for you is a really great way to do that. So that would be something that I would make sure to have. even if you're new, if you're starting out, get some testimonials or reviews. Use formulas. Okay. If you search up copywriting formulas, you're gonna find a whole ton of them out there. PAS is, pain agitate solve. So that would be bringing up the pain where they are now really talking about it and agitating it out of their system and then tell them how they can solve it using what you are trying to sell. That is a very popular one. Another popular one is attention, interest, desire, action, or a ADIA. I never know quite how to pronounce it. but that one is it's similar. You wanna get their intention You wanna increase their interest in your product or service, you want to create a desire for it, and then you wanna encourage them to take action. Next is pain points. I think people get stuck with what pain points are. This is a great chance to go talk to people who are potential customers, potential clients, and find out what they're really struggling with, find out what their biggest pain points are. You know, pain point could be that, you know, they're they're overwhelmed with getting started in something. A pain point could be they don't have confidence that they can do something. a pain point could be that they need to make money from home and have you know, no idea how you even start researching that. You know, pain points aren't necessarily, you know, like, physical pain or, like, mental anguish, but it is something that's causing comfort in their life, and you wanna be able to talk about what that discomfort is and how they could solve it. and then break it up. Don't use big paragraphs. You know,

Emma Lee Bates [00:28:09]:
3 maybe 5 sentences per paragraph is plenty. you wanna make sure you give the eye plenty of white space. You wanna break up, the text into sections you know, with different colored backgrounds, with lines between them, stuff so that people who are scanning, you know, stuff will catch their eye, they'll read a chunk. You know, they might not read everything on a page. That's really typical, but you wanna make sure you're giving them places for their eye land, places that will catch their attention. Okay. So I have a few gifts for you now. if you download my freebie freebie, you're gonna get the sales page anatomy workbook. It includes a conversion tracker, a sales page checklist, some headline formulas, and that sales page template I showed you at the beginning. So I hope you learned some stuff and got some great stuff out of this, and have a great rest of the summit.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:54]:
Alright, Emma. Thank you. That was fantastic. I learned so much. about sales page anatomy. And I'm really excited because you are offering a free conversion tracker for sales page, which link is below. But just, I mean, So I have a word.

Emma Lee Bates [00:28:54]:
Yes. So I have a a conversion tracker. It has the formula to help you figure out how to track your page, and then, you know, you can record it each month. and then I also I record what I tweet.

Emma Lee Bates [00:29:21]:
