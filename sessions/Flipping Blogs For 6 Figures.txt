Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
All right, guys, I'm excited for this session with Chelsea from her paper route. Chelsea, first of all, thank you so much for being here.

Chelsea Clarke [00:00:06]:
Thanks so much for having me. This is so fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah, because we're going to talk about flipping blogs, which is actually something I've never done, but it's on my list to kind of learn more about because I go back and forth on my very first blog. I'm like, I really haven't touched it in, like, a year, and I want to get back to it, but am I really going to do I want to look at selling it and so feel like this is kind of the knowledge I need to have for that. So can you give us a little bit about your background and just what we're going to talk about today?

Chelsea Clarke [00:00:32]:
Yeah, absolutely. Well, I got started in marketing. I was in corporate marketing, and I was running blogs for big businesses and corporations, and I was having a blog myself as a hobby for a long time. But I wasn't monetizing it. I just didn't make the connection between the two. And then when I finally did, it was like, "Oh, this makes so much sense!" There's so much value in information that you can provide and educate people with, and there's so many ways to make money with your own website. So I quit that job, and I've been building and flipping websites ever since and in all different niches. So I like to niche down and pick one topic and kind of go deep on one topic per blog and then sell it. But then I also have my own website and blog, which is Her Paper Route, and that's where I share marketing tips and blogging tips. So when I'm working on a blog, I really just focused on all the different things that can provide value. So that's always been my way of getting into in and out of a blog quickly, and we'll go into more about the details of that. But yeah, in a nutshell, that's how I got my start, and that's what I do for a living now.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:


Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:
Okay. Yeah. So we're going to talk about how you kind of can get started doing that, how you can look at flipping it, what to look at in terms of, I would guess pricing, you're selling it, and kind of how to do that. Because, I mean, I don't think I Wouldn't even know where to start if I wanted to sell it, to be honest. I think I got one email of someone being like, I might be interested in buying it, and I was, like, not interested at the time. But yeah. So I'm really interested to hear what you have to say. I'm going to let you kind of kick things off because I'm not quite sure where to ask this question to start. So where should we start? If that's kind of what we're looking to do? Whether we're looking to sell a blog, that we're just our heart's not in it anymore, or if we're looking to flip them. How you do?

Liz Stapleton [00:01:54]:


Liz Stapleton [00:01:56]:


Liz Stapleton [00:02:04]:


Liz Stapleton [00:02:05]:


Liz Stapleton [00:02:08]:


Liz Stapleton [00:02:10]:


Liz Stapleton [00:02:21]:


Chelsea Clarke [00:02:22]:
Sounds good. Yeah. So let's say that you have a blog and maybe you weren't intending to sell it, you were intending to run it for a while, but for whatever reason, you lost interest, you got bored, you got busy, you don't want to keep running it anymore. And that's always a big thing for people that want to sell, is they just don't have the time or they've lost interest. It just doesn't fire them up anymore. So you would be surprised how many people out there will pay money for your blog. Even if it's not making any money, you'll definitely get more money if it's making revenue. But there are people who want starter blogs, so I always say, don't cut yourself off before you've actually given it a shot because there are lots of people and buyers out there who want all different types of websites. So if you have a website, let's say it's getting a little bit of traffic, maybe it's making some money in affiliate sales, that's great. You'll really want to focus on getting more traffic to it and increasing the revenue. If you're willing to put in a bit of work, if you just want to get out, you can just put it up, sell it and move on. But if you really want to get some money for it, I would say focus on using Pinterest to drive traffic. Running a promoted Pin, that's the fastest way. great for your advertising dollars to get traffic coming to the website. Because no matter what, a buyer is looking for a website that is active. Unless you're a flipper like me, and you're looking for a website that kind of hasn't been used for a while and there's room for improvement, most people aren't looking for that. Most people want something that's already generating money and they can just kind of come in and it's working for them. So if you can get your blog in the best shape that it can be, you're going to be able to sell for a higher price. And this talk, I think we're calling it, I think it's: Selling Your Blog for Six Figures. And that's absolutely possible. You just have to think about how much money you're making per month. So a general rule is a website is sold for the two years ahead, projected income. So if your blog is making $1,000 a month right now, times that by 24, we'll say we're going to sell it for the two year projected. So that's a listing price of about $24,000. But there's a lot of other things that can make it more value or sorry, a higher value. Things like if your traffic is really good, if you have beautiful design, if you have a large email list, that's always going to be a valuable asset for a buyer. If they can come in and they see you have customers, subscribers, that's just going to add more value. So just based on revenue alone, though, we're just saying that $24,000. Let's say that your goal is to sell your blog for $100,000, and your goal will be to have that blog making about $8,300 per month. And if you can run it for a year so you have a one year revenue history showing that it's making about $8,000, then you absolutely could be listing it in that six figure market.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:30]:
Okay, quick question, because...

Chelsea Clarke [00:05:35]:
I could go blah blah, so please cut me off.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:
$8300 a month is 100 grand a year.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:40]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:41]:
So if you're doing two years out, wouldn't you technically really need to make like four grand-ish a month?

Chelsea Clarke [00:05:46]:
Exactly. Yeah. If we're just saying the two years, then yes, you cut it in half. But I always like to say you'll want to aim higher in your mind.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:54]:
Absolutely.

Chelsea Clarke [00:05:55]:
The goal I should have mentioned that because that's going to make a lot easier. So also if your goal is to hit, say you want to hit 100,000 page views per month, you'll just be wanting to have a higher number in your mind because it's a lot easier to hit. If you aim for that one number, it's going to be more of a struggle, I find, just with the mindset around.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:16]:
Mindset? Yes. The session I record earlier was on Mindset, so there's a session on that in the Summit, too. Don't you worry.

Chelsea Clarke [00:06:23]:
I can't wait to see everybody's interviews. I'm so excited to see the Summit.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:27]:
I'm really excited how well it's come together and all the information. How generous all the speakers have been with their time and their knowledge, yourself included. It's really exciting!

Liz Stapleton [00:06:37]:


Liz Stapleton [00:06:41]:
Okay, so that's kind of getting a guesstimate of what the value of your blog might be worth. But where do you start? Where do you list it, how many factors? Because I've worked with clients who bought their blog, and so I got a little bit of insight in sort of what they looked at. But it can vary a lot depending on the cleanup that needs to be done.

Chelsea Clarke [00:07:06]:
That's a great point that you make, too. That's an awesome point. I want to touch on that quickly because there's a lot of work that goes into, no matter what, your website is going to be a certain amount of work for someone. So if you can make it easier for someone, you fixed your broken links, you have things kind of a nice flow, the content is easy to read and that sort of thing. It's just making it less work for someone. So that's always good.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:30]:


Chelsea Clarke [00:07:32]:
Where you can list and sell your blog. There's a few places online now that I've been doing this for a while. I have a business called Blogs for Sale, and I just sell it, Blogforsale.co. And it's a marketplace where people work with me to list their blogs and I work with my network of buyers and we help find the right buyer for your website. But I'm certainly not the only place. So there's Flippa online. Flippa.com, that's a great place as well. If you want to get a higher selling price than Flipa generally Empire Flippers is great. You will need a very high value website to sell on Empire Flippers. They will require a larger revenue history and not all revenue is the same, which we'll jump into a little bit too, the different ways that you can bring money to your website. But yeah, those are like the main ones that are sort of the leading industry places to sell your website. And you can also just sell it yourself. You don't need a broker or an online marketplace. You probably have someone on your email list. If you were to send out a newsletter and say, "Hey, thank you so much for reading my blog all these years. I'm kind of thinking that I'm moving in a different direction, putting the word out there that my website is now for sale." I bet you, there's going to be someone on your list who will take interest, at least to reach out and discuss more with you.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:57]:
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Okay, so once you've decided you want to sell your blog, or a blog that you have because you're working more on another one or whatever, because once you get into this, you get addicted and all of sudden, you have like 17 domains you own and three blogs. Each year, "Do I want to renew that domain? I'm not doing anything with it." And you know the different places you can kind of put it out there for sale. What do you need to put together to put it for sale? Kind of, what do you need to look at? Like you said, there's different revenue types that some are of more interest than others. What does that process look like?

Liz Stapleton [00:09:38]:


Chelsea Clarke [00:09:41]:
Yeah. So when buyers are looking at a website and they're looking at where the money is coming from. If you provide a service that really takes you to do it, that's not going to be as attractive to a buyer, because they may not be able to replicate that same service that you do.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:50]:


Chelsea Clarke [00:09:52]:


Liz Stapleton [00:09:58]:
Something like sponsored content, bringing in the majority of your income.

Chelsea Clarke [00:10:01]:
Yeah, like sponsored content maybe alright if the sponsors are supplying the article. But if you, the buyer, are familiar with writing and you're okay to take on that job, but yeah, exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:12]:
That's something that's a little less passive. Totally.

Chelsea Clarke [00:10:15]:
Totally. Yeah. The less passive, the less value for a selling place. But if you have a website that's making affiliate income, that's nice. That's a nice to have. And it's definitely a great way for you to make money while you're running the website. You're just going to hope that the buyer has some experience with affiliate marketing that they'll understand about, it's not always passive. You have to have traffic. You should be actively promoting your affiliate content. So it's a nice to have, definitely, but it's not the main thing that they're looking for.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:48]:
Okay.

Chelsea Clarke [00:10:51]:
The top way that you can bring in money that will be the most attractive to a buyer is ad revenue with traffic. So if your website is getting a lot of traffic, whatever a lot means to you, it's making some money and it's in a premium ad network, all the better. So something like Mediavine, if you can get your website approved in Mediavine and stick with them for a couple of months to show a history of earning money with them, you are way ahead of the game and you have a high value asset. Your website is a high value asset just from that.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:23]:
And we have a session from someone at Mediavine talking about SEO, which helps you get traffic. So definitely check out that session.

Chelsea Clarke [00:11:30]:
Yeah, I'll be checking that out too.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:34]:
Yeah. So premium ad work networks. I feel like Mediavine is most well known because it does let you in usually around 25,000 sessions. But Ad Thrive, which is usually around 100,000. It's another premium one. Pretty much anything that's not like Media.net AdSense...I'm trying to think of another one that's not as good, but any of kind of the other ones usually.

Chelsea Clarke [00:11:57]:
Yeah, that's always good. It'll look nice on your listing wherever you're selling it. Just having that on there, people love to see that.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:06]:
Yeah, because it also speaks to at least the minimum traffic that you have because those networks are exclusive to certain levels.

Chelsea Clarke [00:12:13]:
Yes, definitely. And also I think they're also limited to certain locations too. So if you have a lot of North American traffic, that's always appealing to a buyer, especially overseas buyers, too. They want that American traffic. So if you have a website, no matter where you live, like I live in Canada, but all my blogs are all US and all American customers. That's the cream of the crop if you can do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:37]:
Yeah, okay. No, that's good to know. It's a good point. And what sort of ad network you're in, it also could depend on your niche. Right? Because search and ad networks don't like to work in certain niches or that's just not their area, and so if you get rejected from someone, that doesn't mean you can't get into another premium ad network.

Chelsea Clarke [00:12:57]:
Yeah, that's a great point.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:59]:
Just from my little knowledge of various clients and years of blogging. Okay, so in terms of selling a blog ads are new super important. Affiliates, nice to have. Sponsored, may be good. And really the other monetization model for blogging is products. Does that play into selling it at all or what does that...

Chelsea Clarke [00:13:20]:
Yes, definitely! That was the next thing I was going to say is always, always have digital products for your blog. Create a course, create an ebook and create a free version of it too, so that it shows that you're getting people on your email list with the free offer, which then can lead into a paid course or a paid ebook. Buyers really want to see a website that also has digital content like that because that is just something that they will own when they buy it, it's theirs and they can resell it and continue to grow with it. So those top like, ad revenue and digital products always, always make that your goal.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:01]:
And probably a history of sales of the digital products I would assume place into that as well. Knowing kind of your site conversion rate.

Chelsea Clarke [00:14:11]:
You tell me if I'm wrong and you're totally right. You are an experienced blogger. You know all this stuff. It's the same kind of thing that helps make your own blog successful, is going to be appealing to someone who wants to buy it. So it really is probably a lot of things that bloggers listening. Here are things that you're already trying to work on just for your own blog and your own business as you're trying to grow it. These are all things that are great that you're doing, because if you do decide to sell later, this is what people are going to see, the value in what you've done.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:45]:
So I do want to ask because when you sell your blog, at least as you're describing, you're not just selling the blog, you're selling everything that goes with it. So the email list associated with it. Which I assume there's some legal stuff there that needs to be worked out in order to do that, or some notification going on. So can you kind of walk us through that? I feel like people don't even realize how much stuff is tied to the blog sometimes. So can you share that?

Chelsea Clarke [00:15:15]:
Yeah. So first of all, whether you're selling your blog or not, the fact that you have a website, you need to make sure that you follow the laws for having an email list for...Yeah, so great. Check those out.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:31]:
We have three sessions on legal stuff but I don't know that we cover actually selling your list, which is a little bit different.

Chelsea Clarke [00:15:36]:
Yeah. So if you're already following those main legal aspects of having a website, then you're already going to be covered when you go to sell it. Because when you sell your website, you're selling everything that goes with it and they take over everything. And you have a legal document. If you go through me and I help you sell, I provide all these legal documents between you and your buyer so that you're both covered and it states exactly who owns it and what that transfer encompasses. So if you're already following email laws, you're okay. When you have that transfer, the buyer essentially becomes they are the business now. So there's nothing extra that you have to do. As long as you just have those legal clauses in your sale agreement, then everything's covered. And you don't actually have to send out an email blast and say, oh, I'm no longer here. There's actually a lot of companies that will buy a website and they will continue to pretend to be that person, and it's part of the agreement. And there's actually a lot of really big bloggers out there who sold a long time ago. And it's a big secret that a corporation actually is still running their website, the pictures on the website, and they're sending out emails every week as if they are this.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:51]:
Yeah. And so you need to be okay with that if that's something you're going to take. But you do have to with the new law in California CCPA, and again, not legal advice, you are going to have to on your privacy policy, you're going to have to notify California residents and give them the right to opt out of having their information be sold. And that just went to effect in January.

Chelsea Clarke [00:17:11]:
In January.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:12]:
So this month that we're recording right now. So that may be a little less known, but there's a little tweaks in sort of the agreements and stuff that you're having to do to your yeah.

Chelsea Clarke [00:17:20]:
And you want to put all of that information in your original privacy policy page on your website as well.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:26]:
Yes, exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:27]:
So make sure that's in there. So I just wanted to touch on that because that is a new thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:33]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:36]:
So you put it up for sale. Do you fill out a form that shares your information? Do you put together like a presentation that's like the information on your site and the conversion rates and the money and all the information we've discussed? What does the for sale sign look like? A house is like the picture of the interior. What does it look like for a blog?

Chelsea Clarke [00:17:58]:
It's exactly like flipping a house. You want to have all of your information out there. You're going to want to have a profit and loss sheet. This is just a standard spreadsheet that shows how much you make each month, where that money is coming from, like who's paying you and how much you're spending every month. And that is your PNL statement. And that's something that every buyer is going to want to see. They're also going to want to see your Google Analytics so you can add them to your Google Analytics just so that they can have view access, just check for themselves to make sure that what you're saying about your traffic is true. And they can just verify that. You'll also want to have pictures. So pictures of your social accounts, snapshots of how many followers you have on Instagram, things like that. All of these little tidbits, a snapshot of how many email subscribers you have. You just want to paint the picture of what it's like for someone so they can easily just read the info and imagine themselves owning that website just like they would if they were buying a house.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:00]:
Okay, no, that's a great point actually, on that point, because when you stage a house, you want to take out the pieces of you, right?

Liz Stapleton [00:19:10]:
Like that. You always see that. I don't know how many people know that. Maybe I just watched too much HTV. And I've heard of bloggers that when they are looking to put their blog for sale, they try to kind of take their personal aspect out of it. To what extent do you recommend that? Do you really have to do that? Kind of what?

Chelsea Clarke [00:19:31]:
Yeah, it's really your own personal choice. I do recommend removing yourself as much as you can just because when someone takes over your business, everything that they get that day that they take over ownership is theirs. That means that if your face is on the blog, they own that picture, your name, they could continue using your name. So if you don't remove it before or you don't state in your sale agreement that you're not okay with that, they have full reign to run the business with your face still there and your name. So your name will always be attached to that and it's out in the world. So I always say, no, just remove your personal name, your family's name, your pictures, just make it so that it's morestuffnonymous, just for your own privacy. Because ten years down the road they could sell it to someone else and you'll have no control over that stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:25]:
Does a blog, sales wise, look more attractive if it's more about the blog brand as opposed to the personal brand?

Chelsea Clarke [00:20:30]:
Yeah. And it really depends what your niche is and what you're selling. If it is a blog where it's your personal opinions and your personal reviews of things, then it does help to have a picture and a name. But the thing is you don't have to use your real name when you go to sell. You can just swap it for a different person's name and swap your photo for a stock photo of someone else if you have the right to use that photo. Because, yeah, you can protect your privacy that way and it can still look like it's a real person to anyone coming to view the blog, but you yourself have stepped out of it. So that's what I recommend doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:09]:
Yeah, I would also try to be upfront about that if you're like. I'm using a different name for this because there was a whole scandal in the personal finance space two years ago about Drew Cloud who turned out to not be a real person but was quoted in tons of articles and looked to as an expert. And so, I mean, it's a little different if you're just like changing, but if you're kind of starting from that place, I'd be upfront about whatever, the actual expertise, because you don't want to be portraying something you're not necessarily to a certain extent, there's a difference.

Chelsea Clarke [00:21:43]:
Yeah. There's definitely an ethics thing that will come into it. And I think you really have to just think about what you're comfortable with. If it feels wrong to you, then it probably is. So just always in whatever type of business you're in, just do it the right way. Just be cool.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:58]:
Yes. I like that. Okay, so you've got it up for sale. Ideally, you probably get multiple offers. Right. And maybe like selling a house. I mean, I've never actually sold a house, but I watch a lot of HGTV. Does that tend to happen? We get multiple offers. What does that look like?

Chelsea Clarke [00:22:18]:
Yeah. So when you're selling your blog, you always hope that you'll get multiple offers. If you're putting it up for auction, you could get multiple bidders, which is great if you're putting it up with a broker. It really just depends how good your content is and if the right buyer is seeing it at the right time. So there's really no way to tell you. "Yes, you are going to get so many buyers and bidders and interest on it." It's always going to be personal to the website and the person.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:48]:
Yeah. And I mean, those bids or offers could be above or below your asking price I guess.

Chelsea Clarke [00:22:54]:
That's right. Yeah. Your asking price is just a median and you should be prepared that you will be negotiating because, yeah, you're probably going to sell a little bit under, but I've definitely worked with people who've ended up selling for more because there has been more interest and more buyers fighting it out over it.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:
Yeah.

Chelsea Clarke [00:23:16]:
Sorry, go ahead.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:17]:
I was just going to say don't be scared to ask for something and don't be scared to negotiate.

Chelsea Clarke [00:23:22]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:24]:
And actually, Jamie Lieberman, who did the talk on trademarks and copyrights, offered, a negotiation worksheet. So if you need to get a little more comfortable with that, her free offer was negotiation worksheet. That might help.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:34]:
That might help. Yeah.

Chelsea Clarke [00:23:35]:
Yeah, always negotiate. Never accept the first offer. And you know, it's your baby. You built that website, you ran it. Those are your words. You don't have to sell it for anything less than you're comfortable with.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:48]:
Yeah. Walk away if it's not what you want. That's okay. And I had interrupted you. I think you covered what you were going to say.

Chelsea Clarke [00:23:58]:
Yeah, I got to that.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:00]:
Okay. So you might get multiple offers and stuff, and then there is a contract in place. There should be a lot more contracts in blogging than there are, unfortunately, I feel like, for most people. So contract, read it, hire a lawyer to look through it, just so that you understand what all you're selling and what you're agreeing to.

Chelsea Clarke [00:24:20]:
Yes, 100%. That is so important. And if you are working with me. The contract was written by my lawyer and she and I can answer questions at any time, too. And you're always encouraged to reach out to your own lawyer and your own team always for anything before signing anything.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:37]:
Yes, absolutely. And then how does the money work? Because it is an online world, it could be a large sum of money.

Chelsea Clarke [00:24:47]:
Escrow. Always escrow? Yes, always. PayPal does not protect sellers. It's just, oh, God, I've heard horror stories. And Escrow protects you. And what Escrow is, it's just an online service. You can do it yourself. You can have a broker do it. You put your money into this third party account, you send the website to your buyer, and then when they check everything out and they agree to it, then they can release that money to you. So if you're buying a website, you get that protection as well. It just protects both parties. If there's any ever a problem, there is a person at Escrow that can work with you to work it out, and you're just so. Oh, I always see people, they're like, "Oh, I'll just use PayPal. It's easy." It's like, "Oh, just don't"

Liz Stapleton [00:25:38]:
It's like, oh, just don't it's not insured. It's not no.

Chelsea Clarke [00:25:41]:
Yeah, exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:42]:
We have a session on that too. We have a session where like an accountant is like, don't use it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:25:50]:
Costs are actually similar, if not sometimes less, to use Escrow than PayPal, so you have no excuse.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:57]:
Yeah, I understand why bloggers use PayPal for certain things. Sometimes it's the only way to pay affiliates depending on what you're using. Yeah, there's totally reasons why you use it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:26:07]:
But a big sale like your website.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:11]:
Don't do it. And try to use it more as a pass through account than as your only business checking because it's not really bank. Okay, so Escrow is how you work that out and then once you send everything, you're done. How does that work?

Chelsea Clarke [00:26:32]:
Yeah. So you'll want to make sure that you send them everything. So the website files, the domain transfer, the social accounts, the email list, anything. If you have courses, maybe it's your teachable account or your Podia account, whatever it is.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:48]:
Okay, it's a question because you're likely paying for teachable, you're paying for Podia, you're paying for plugins sometimes. How does that work in terms of the annual subscription comes up?

Liz Stapleton [00:27:01]:
Yeah.

Chelsea Clarke [00:27:01]:
So unless the buyer wants to take over those plugins, they can. They could just take over the account and change the payment info to their own, or you can do that for them.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:17]:
Yeah, but like a Teachable account or a Podia thing.

Chelsea Clarke [00:27:20]:
Yeah. So something like that, you can do the same thing, like, just take it over and change it to your own name and your own payment. And I have done that before, but since I already have my own Podia account for my other courses, a lot of the time. I will just use my own account if it's something that I'm going to merge into my own business somewhere else. But yeah, you can always change your name, change their name, change their payment to your own. But personally, I like to just start fresh. I'll start a new Podia account and I'll just bring everything over and then close the other one. That way I know I have that peace of mind that it's just me from the start and I start and.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:02]:
That'S when you buy it. But when you sell it, do you just go in, like, delete your payment information yeah. To make sure you're not being charged after you've sold it. Right, because, I mean, you don't like that's kind of yeah.

Chelsea Clarke [00:28:15]:
You would never just give any of your accounts with your credit card information on it. You would never do that. So you would have to work it out. And this will be between it really depends on what you and the buyer's deal is. It'll be different for everyone, but yeah, I would always say yeah. So you should remove your payment information and anything personal when you give it over to them and then they can just fill in their own information.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:37]:
Okay, got you.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:40]:
Is there like a resource somewhere that kind of is like, remember to check all this stuff for your personal information before you sell it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:28:47]:
Yeah, and that's actually included in my free offer, which we'll talk about later. But...

Liz Stapleton [00:28:53]:
I feel like there's a lot of places that I'd be like...Because especially if you started like years ago and you've been at it for I can only imagine how much stuff.

Chelsea Clarke [00:29:01]:
Exactly, yeah, you'd be surprised when you start looking. You've probably got affiliate accounts all over the place, but you don't have to give away your affiliate account either. I do want to say that they can just set up their own affiliate account and add in their own link. And I always recommend use the Pretty Links plugin, it's free. It's a really easy way to keep track of your affiliate link so that when you sell something, your buyer can just change the link once and it changes everywhere. It makes it a lot easier.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:27]:
Yeah. Pretty Link or a tool like it I use Lasso, which is a paid plugin, but it also shows me how I've optimized pages for affiliate links. So it's got some features especially, and it tracks in my Google Analytics, too. Which I'm sure that potential Buyers would be interested in seeing. "Okay, well, how many actually clicks are they getting? How much is it converting?"

Chelsea Clarke [00:29:46]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:46]:
I feel like when you're selling, the more data you can provide, the better would be my guess.

Chelsea Clarke [00:29:51]:
Absolutely! Yeah. The more transparent you can be and the more information you can provide. It makes it a lot easier. And you're going to have more offers and just giving the buyers more information about what the business is because you run it, it all makes sense to you. But for someone who just found out about it, they have no idea.

Chelsea Clarke [00:29:57]:
Makes it a lot easier. And you're going to have more offers and just giving the buyers more information about what the business is because you run it, it all makes sense to you. But for someone who just found out about it, they have no idea.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:11]:
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:13]:
Okay, I'm trying to think if I had other questions on this topic that I wanted to ask you. Is there anything we haven't covered? Do you feel like in terms of what it looks like to sell and how to get going on that?

Chelsea Clarke [00:30:25]:
I think something that a lot of people sort of it stops them from wanting to sell is they worry about the tech side of it, like how to actually get their website to someone else. And actually it is really easy. There's even a free plugin called Migrate Guru Plugin, which makes it really easy to just transfer from one hosting account to another. And I mean, people think, oh, that there's going to be so much back and forth and it's really not. And you'll be surprised. It's really easy to do a domain transfer too, if you've never done it before. It's as simple as logging into the new registrar, initiating the transfer by clicking a button, paying the $9 or whatever it is, and then away it goes a couple of days later.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:09]:
It's probably a little like emotionally scary how simple it is. Kind of like when you hand over the keys to your house. It's like, well, once the keys. After all that work, you're like, "Oh, I just had to click a few buttons and it's gone."

Chelsea Clarke [00:31:23]:
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Yeah, the emotional side of it is huge, especially if it's a blog that you've been running for a long time. You're going to go back and see that content before you sell it and you're like, "Oh, I remember when I wrote that!" or "I was in school," or "I just had my baby," or whatever it is. And it's an emotional roller coaster too, so you kind of have to be prepared for all the different aspects of selling your website. But it's so great when you do sell and that money lands in your bank account and you're like, "Yes!" Because you can move forward, focus on the next thing in your business.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:57]:
I think there's that sense of accomplishment, too, is I built an asset from nothing that I was able to sell for. It's kind of like I built the house, I've got the plot of land and I built the entire house and decorated and did all things and someone bought it and now I get to go do something else now with having made that money. So I think that's amazing. Sorry, I'm just like I can imagine the roller coaster, but yeah, sense of accomplishment once you do sell as well.

Chelsea Clarke [00:32:32]:
Yeah, absolutely. People are so happy when you've gone through all of that and it's done and you've got your money and you're just ready to move forward.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:42]:
No, I like that. Okay, you already mentioned it. A little bit, but I know you do have a free offer for attendees. You want to tell us a little bit about it?

Liz Stapleton [00:34:54]:
Because hopefully this session gave you a good idea of kind of how to start approaching it and what things you need to start getting together. But I think, of course, like that. I keep using an analogy of selling your house, but there's a lot of little things. There's checking the foundation, there's so many things to I think a course can help and she's a great resource for that. So thank you. Any final words of advice or tips for those attending?

Chelsea Clarke [00:35:22]:
I think whether you're wanting to sell your blog or you're not, you're just trying to make money with it. People can get really overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work that it takes to run a blog and get it to the point where it's actually becoming your full time business. But I always say do not give up because so many people give up before your blog actually has a shot. And you will be really surprised if you just stick with it. What can happen? It doesn't happen overnight, but it does happen if you stick with it. So just hang in there. And you really do have this.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:55]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:56]:
You could do it? If I could do it, trust me, anyone can. Like, I take after my mom who walks towards the computer and it crashes. So if I can do it I mean, it may have taken me six months to figure out how to do drop down menu, but if I could do it, anybody can. It really is. It's a persistent thing. Don't bang your head against the wall, but just keep going. You'll get there and hopefully this summit will help. So thank you again so much. I appreciate all of your knowledge, generosity and time.

Chelsea Clarke [00:36:26]:
