Hi, guys. Welcome to Super Simple Short Form Video. I'm here to teach you all about how to take your short-form video content and make it super profitable for you, for your business, so that you're not wasting your time. We're not chasing vanity metrics and you're actually making money from what basically is the hot form of content right now. So just kind of like as a heads up, we will be talking about both TikToks, Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Any kind of those short form, vertical -- vertical? Vertical videos that's what we're going to be talking about today. You will hear me use the words TikToks, Reels, and Shorts kind of interchangeably. So, don't just assume that it's just for the one platform. This is kind of things that goes across all of the different platforms as we're going. So I did not update these numbers today, but I wanted to show this to you. So before we kind of go anywhere, why am I talking about this? Hi, I'm Caroline. I have on TikTok at this point, I have more than 118,000 followers on TikTok. On Instagram right now, I have over 32,000, but in January of this year I had barely 9,000. And so it's grown very rapidly on Instagram this year, and the only thing that I did differently was that I started uploading my Reels consistently.

[00:01:32.840] - Caroline
I stopped relying just on the static posts and started uploading my Reels which are just recycled TikToks, which we will talk about, so don't worry. But for my growth strategies, for both of them, it's posting every single day as often as humanly possible -- as often as humanly possible. If you skip a day, it's not the end of the world, but this is kind of the growth strategy that they want to be seeing on both of these platforms and on YouTube. If you want to be doing short-form video, you have to commit to it consistently. Instagram is a little bit more difficult because I do Reels every single day which are just repurposed TikToks. I'll do a static post every other day, usually, and I'll post to my stories daily. So we'll talk more about kind of those strategies as we go. But before we get into that, hi, if we haven't met yet, I'm Caroline of carolinevencil.com and the Creative Entrepreneur Society. I have four beautiful children. My oldest is 13 and my youngest is four. It's never quiet in my house and someone's always hungry. I have been a content creator since 2015. I like to call myself an Internet dinosaur since I have been in the blogging space since 2015.

[00:02:43.610] - Caroline
I have seen a lot of different things come and go. But these are the strategies that we're going to be talking about that will help you stop trying to be like a flash in the pan and will help you get long-term success. On the back story of this is, it's more than just blogging for me. I do only work about 25 hours a week. Just to get and see that there's four children in my house. It's very busy. And in my spare time, I am a CrossFitter. My family and I play Mario Cart. My husband and I play Destiny 2, and I love making money while I sleep. So let's get into kind of like the nitty-gritty of what are the actual tools that you need in order to make this, this whole like short-form video thing for yourself. There's a lot of things that people have said over the years, and ultimately, I disagree with a lot of it, if we're being completely honest. And really what you need is your phone and a light source. And your light source can be anything like a ring light or, right now, what I'm using because my ring light decided to die on me right before I filmed this video, if we're being completely honest,

[00:03:47.780] - Caroline
I've opened up all of the windows in my room. Now, is it perfect because my laptop is in like the corner? No, it's not. But having some kind of a good light source does add to, I guess, like the crispness of the video and makes it easier for people to want to stick around and watch it. So ultimately, that's it. You have your phone. You have a window. Congratulations, you can make an awesome short-form video. You don't need anything crazy. You don't need to buy an expensive DSLR camera. You don't need anything like that. If you want to, you can get cut, cut -- CapCut. That's what it is CapCut. It's an app. It's free. You can record things there. You can edit things there. It's again free, but you don't need to get it. So that's kind of one of the biggest things that I think a lot of people freak out about is, what kind of things do I need. You really don't. You don't even need a tripod if you don't want to. You can get one. Like I said, this little picture here has a ring light that has a tripod holder in the middle. I hold my phone. I have a pop socket and I hold my phone.

[00:04:49.840] - Caroline
So there's the tools that you need. We're not making things complicated here at all. What if you don't want to show your face in the videos? We're going to talk about this in just a second. But what do you need? Cool beans -- you can use Canva and you can make slides on Canva. I have seen a lot of those in a short-form video. You can also use them as carousels in Instagram if you wanted. TikTok also has like a Slideshow thing that's similar to a carousel or you can just have them play. So, if you had kind of something that was a carousel, you just set the slides up to be three seconds long each and save it as a video, ta-da. If you don't want to do that and you have things that are more -- if you have planners or something that you want to show -- planners -- this is a notepad that you want to show off, you can always get a tripod that has the ability to point over top. So you would have your camera pointing down at the desk to show your hands. If you're cooking something, you can do it that way. A tripod is like 15 bucks.  Or you can -- I have done this before

[00:05:49.930] - Caroline
I have quite literally like leaned my phone on things and that has worked as well. But as far as like tech that you need, if you don't want to show your face, this is it. It doesn't have to be difficult. It's -- I skipped one. I don't want to show my face in videos. Let's talk about this for a hot second because this is the thing. You can be successful without showing your face. However, if you have a personal brand, if you are the brand, for example, my business is carolinevencil.com I have -- I'm the face of my brand, so I have a personal brand. I want to show my face because it builds that name brand recognition, builds connections. People think that you're a real person, and that helps to facilitate building trust as well. I get it. If you don't want to show your face, that's a big hang-up that a lot of people have. But just in case you needed to hear it, you are beautiful. No, you don't have a weird accent. No, your voice doesn't sound weird. We judge ourselves so much more harshly than anybody else would ever judge us. So don't feel like you are too much or too blank or not enough of blank.

[00:06:53.440] - Caroline
You absolutely are. Put your face on camera. There's nothing wrong with it. But if you don't feel confident in doing that just yet, you can always go back to starting out without showing your face in your videos. But I do recommend that you do. Trends: this is another one of those hangups that a lot of people have when they're first starting with this kind of short form video. Do you have to do the trends? Do you have to learn all the TikTok dances and dance like the little children? No, you don't. No, you don't. You don't have to kind of try to figure out how to fit the square peg in the round hole of all of these trends and figure out how can you make that work for your branding if it doesn't make sense. You don't have to. All of my TikToks that I have ever created, well, not ever -- when I first started, I tried to do trends and it was just -- it made me want to pull my hair out. I'm not going to lie, and it didn't go anywhere. It was only once I actually started doing the method that I'm going to teach you guys for your video timelines that I actually grew my audience.

[00:07:50.020] - Caroline
And that was because it was difficult. I hated trying to figure out the trends. I'm not a dancing person. I don't like to wear makeup all of the time. You get to choose whether or not you want to do them. Is it a make or break thing that if you do a trend, you will go viral? No. Is it a make or break thing that if you don't do a trend, you will never have a successful short-form video? No. You do you, and you can make those kinds of decisions. And here's kind of the other thing is that with TikTok and Instagram, I guess, but I really only know TikTok about these with these filters. You can use filters. Do you have to? No, but if you are like, I don't want to put on makeup today, cool beans. There's a filter for that. I love doing that when I just don't feel like putting on makeup, but you don't need to use them. The cool ones are like the green screen ones where it allows you to your background. You can change your background to kind of you've seen people who have -- I should have had more props available.

[00:08:50.610] - Caroline
Hold, please. We're going to use my calculator as my example. So, for example, if you're talking about a product and you want it to appear behind you, a green screen filter will allow you to do that. You don't need to figure out how to use them. You can, but it's not mandatory. The next thing is music. So let's talk about music really quick. Do you need to have trending sounds in the backgrounds of your videos? I am on team no. And here's why because in 2022, YouTube especially crackdown on any kind of usage of copywritten materials inside of videos. So we're talking like if you have more than two seconds of a song in a background and it's copywritten, YouTube was striking it down and saying like we have to -- you can't use this, this sound in the background because it's copywritten by Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson, whoever, Taylor Swift. Like, um, that was so kind of one of the problems is that if you used it -- if you made a TikTok and it was really fantastic, and even if it went viral or something, if Beyonce said like I never want any of my music in the background of TikToks or in the background of YouTube shorts, it's copyright infringement shut it down. Anybody who used any of Beyonce's music in the background of their videos will have their videos muted.

[00:10:10.020] - Caroline
Like the audio will be muted. At least that's what it is on TikTok. I think that it's the same way on Instagram, but sometimes they'll just take down the video completely. So sometimes they'll mute it. Sometimes they'll take it down. It depends, and because of that, I stopped using music in the backgrounds of my videos because when it mutes the background or when it mutes the audio, all of that work that I did inside of that TikTok or that short-form video of whatever kind is gone. If I can't play it without it getting muted entirely, it's gone. So, I've stopped using music in the backgrounds of videos. That's just me. If you want to do trends, obviously music and kind of sounds are going to be important for those. But I don't think that they have sticking power in the same way that just teaching does. So, do you have to figure out music? No. Do you have to use music in the backgrounds? No. Is using music in the backgrounds or trending audio in the background of your short-form video of any kind going to make or break your video's ability to do well on a platform? No. So, now that we've gotten all of those kinds of hangups out of the way let's talk about your video timeline.

[00:11:18.580] - Caroline
We're going to talk about these videos in the concept of a 60-second video timeline. Okay? This is for all platforms. This is the kind of, I guess, modeology [SIC] -- methodology. This is what I use for all of my videos, and you'll see it. So, we're breaking it up into four different parts. Do you have to use all of these parts exactly? No, but I'm going to show you how to use them strategically so that you can actually make your money from your videos. The first part that we're going to talk about in your 60-second timeline is a hook. So, let's talk about your hook. These are the first one to three seconds. Our attention spans are teensy, teensy, tiny. Our attention spans are teensy, teensy, tiny. If you don't have a hook that sells me in those first three seconds, I'm out. Think about scrolling. I'm so sorry, I'm just getting over a cold. Think about scrolling on TikTok or Instagram. If you stay and watch something, is it making a decision in your head in the first one to three seconds? Yes. That's how long that it takes for you to decide if you're going to watch something. That's how short our attention spans are.

[00:12:31.960] - Caroline
That's how short our ability to hook somebody into watching the rest of our video is. So, this is kind of like the most crucial moment in our entire video is that first one to three seconds. Why do they care? Why should they care? Why should they stick around? This is the time to work on editing, which is where I brought up CapCut in the very beginning. You can also do it on the platform. So, what you want to do inside of your hook is if you are, this is the part that I edit, if you start your video and you're kind of I'm going to hold up my phone, and you pause for a second to make sure that the video is starting and then you go, hey, everybody you want to cut out that pause because that break is enough for me to keep scrolling. And it's enough for a lot of people to keep scrolling as well. You want that hook to be instantaneous. So here are some of the things that you can use to make your hook. I, in almost all of my videos, I start my videos by saying Canva hack because I know that people who are interested in Canva want to hear about it.

[00:13:36.660] - Caroline
I know that that is a first second -- split second that I can use to make and it works. If you struggle with blank, then you need to watch this video. X number of things I didn't know about the topic that we're going to talk about and how to become an expert. If you are a blank, if you are a mom, if you are a gardener, if you are a crazy cat lady like me, here are X number of tools that you need. I wish that I knew blankety-blank as a brand new crazy cat lady when I brought my crazy cat home, whatever it is. And brand new tool, feature, hack, app, something like that is sure fire kind of like way to see what it is that you can use to hook people's attention. And if you're still trying to figure out what works inside of your niche, go and watch other people's videos. Watch theirs and see what their hooks are that get you to stick around to watch the rest of their video. Okay. So we've talked about the hook, and next we're kind of going to talk about this topic intro. Your topic intro is going to be like 10 seconds long.

[00:14:46.090] - Caroline
We don't want to take too much time but this is going to be your hook expanded upon. This is where you're going to elaborate on why they should care about it because your hook is that first little sentence that you're using to get people to stick around to hear what it is that your video is about. You're going to tell them what your video is going to be about inside of your topic intro. This is the next kind of drop-off point in video watching. So, you want to keep this short, but you also want to keep it entertaining and explain what it is that they're going to learn. We're not going to belabor this one because quite frankly we're going to go on to explain it a little bit more in just a second. This is another super crucial part in your video timeline, is the talking about you. This is the one where I see a lot of people overlook this, and I don't want you to do that at all. And there's a strategy as to why it comes third and it comes before the longer part at the end. But here's where you're going to talk about you.

[00:15:41.080] - Caroline
This is your business. We're not just here to say like look at this cool thing that I -- I'm going to use another prop on my desk -- look at this cool thing that I bought. It's a baseball. And that's it. That's not a reason for people to stick around. It's not a reason for people to follow you. They don't know what it is that you have to offer. They don't know what other benefits that you can offer them. This is where you're going to talk about yourself. Talk about your business and what they can do to get more of you in their life. So, here's what I say in almost every single one of my videos or some variation of it. If we haven't met yet, hi, I'm Caroline. My business makes more than six figures every year helping online business owners learn how to create, market and promote their own products using Canva. Let me show you something cool that you can do inside of Canva. So, here I've already listed out my credentials. I talk about why I'm an expert, why they should listen to me, what it is that I offer, what it is that I teach inside of all of my stuff, and then what we're going to be talking about for the rest of the video.

[00:16:37.580] - Caroline
We'll talk more about like how other things can kind of contribute to making this super effective and a sticking point for people in just a second. But we can't get to the rest of it before we talk about the rest of the video which is your teaching so you're talking about you should be like five to 10 seconds. This is your elevator pitch. Keep this nice and short because again, quite frankly, people don't necessarily like care, care. That sounds mean, but at the end of the day think about it. I don't really care about you. I know that people don't care about me. They're here to think about what it is that they can learn. What it is that they can gain from watching this video. I like to introduce myself because that builds the know, like and trust relationship right off the bat. But at the end of the day, they're here for this last portion which is the teaching part. Your teaching should be the longest portion of your video. I like to say that it should be 30 seconds. You can kind of fudge up this timeline and it doesn't really matter. But I think that your teaching portion or your education portion or your entertaining portion should be the longest portion of it.

[00:17:39.940] - Caroline
If it's the three things that people need to know is show props. Use props. Use your backgrounds. Use your green screen filters. Remember to hold up your, you know -- if you're talking about a product, like use the images in the background behind you. This is the part where you can do that. Or if you're like me, I quite literally, because when I teach Canva creation, I will literally hold my -- I'm so old -- I'm going to tell you guys this and it's going to make me sound really, really like -- I hold my phone up and I record my computer screen like this. I'll, I'll move my phone around on my big desktop and I will record my computer screen. It doesn't have to be difficult. It doesn't have to be tricky. It doesn't have to even be anything crazy. You could, quite frankly, hold up your phone on your computer screen and show pictures of the images that you want if you want to. There's no real rules. You get to make this part up. But the biggest thing is you want to teach. You want to give that value and you want to help people and give them a reason to stick around and a reason to listen to what you have to say.

[00:18:43.130] - Caroline
So this is your general timeline. That's it. Your hook, your intro, talking about you and why they should care and why they should listen to you, and then giving them that value that you promised from the very beginning. That's it. Now here's where I like to think of, like this gets a little specific, but I wanted to be very, very open about this. I use text overlays to my advantage, and I use this to kind of circumvent a lot of -- what are they called? Like filters that things like if you -- you can't say the word free in certain videos, or you can't say link in bio because that comes up in auto text or auto caption and it will be bad for the algorithm, and then your reach will get suppressed. I don't make the rules. I'm just telling you what I have seen. So, I use my overlays, my text overlays for my calls to action. This is telling people where to go. I use this little screen grab here so that you can see in the aqua box, it says, Canva freebies in bio. That's what I have done. I use the upside-down, I know that there's an actual word for it, but it's an upside-down exclamation mark and a circle just like a bullet point circle.

[00:19:59.210] - Caroline
And so, that's what I use. And here is, oops, here are some other things that you can use. You could say, follow me for more blankety-blank content. Leave a comment of which tool, app, whatever it is that you're talking about, recipe that you like better. Save this video. Use these as your calls to action. Whatever it is that you want your people to do an action for, tell them. Give them something to do. So I told you we were going to come over with these overlays and I wanted to show you what I do. So remember how I said that the you part is kind of important but I don't necessarily like belabor that? I don't. I do have a place a text overlay that will say, follow for more the entire time that I'm talking about me. And then at the end, I will have a text overlay that will say that will encourage people to go over to my bio to sign up for my email newsletter, to grab freebies, to sign up for a webinar, whatever it is. I will use that last portion of the video, at that point in time, to have a text that says, link in bio or freebies in bio or Canva training in bio, whatever it is, that's what I will do.

[00:21:09.260] - Caroline
And here's the why. Okay. Follow for more. I put the follow for more under the you because, quite frankly, I think that following is really important. But here's the cool thing is that following does not have them navigating away from the video. You want people to stay on your video for as long as possible for the algorithm. Again, I don't make the rules. I'm just going to give you feedback from what I have seen. You want people to stay for as long as they possibly can on your video. You don't want people to navigate away from your video by giving them a call to action to go to your bio when they're only 15 seconds into the video. You want them to stay on your video watching as long as possible and follow for more. They can follow or subscribe or whatever it is from that video screen. On TikTok, it's a little plus button. On Instagram, it's a little follow button. Whatever it is, they are still watching the video and they're taking that action from that video. They're not leaving. They're not going anywhere because if they have to go somewhere, they might never come back and finish the video.

[00:22:12.110] - Caroline
We want to give them some kind of a way to stay on the video, interact, give them that call to action there. At the end, that's where the link in bio is because if they have watched through the end of the video, the chances are really high that they are your people. That they are there for you. That they're like, oh, my gosh, this is it. This is what I have been looking for. If they like this piece of content of yours, they're probably going to like your other pieces of content too. That's when it's safe to say, go check out my link in bio. It's okay to navigate away from the video at the end. Because again, if they like the video, if they've stuck around for that long, the chances are really good that they're likely going to take some kind of an action on your profile as well. So I hope that that part made a lot of sense, but that's what I like to do as far as this stuff goes. So here comes the next part. Can you repurpose these videos? Yes. Yes, absolutely, you can. This is something that you should absolutely do. It doesn't matter if it was just made for a TikTok, you can use it on Reels, you can use it on Shorts.

[00:23:17.570] - Caroline
Take that one piece of content and stretch it across all of your different platforms. Repurpose it. Use it constantly. And then if you've used it and it's been a few months, do it again. Save it again. Don't have anything that you want to share for today? Can -- feel sick? Your kids are sick? It's just kind of a blah day. You lose your voice for two weeks. What are you going to do? Repurpose. Take stuff that you've already used, repurpose it, post it again. It doesn't have to be difficult. This is the website that I use. It's called Snaptik, and it's snaptik.app is what it is. I think that there's an actual app for it, but I just use the website. If you just google Snaptik, it'll be there. You, quite frankly, take the URL for your TikTok and just post it there and you can download your video. It gets rid of the watermark. You don't want to save your video and have the watermark because Instagram, especially, has already said that it's going to throttle your reach if you do have that. So we want to avoid that, obviously. So you can download your videos without the watermark.

[00:24:24.360] - Caroline
It's really simple to do so. And then you can repurpose it across all of your different content platforms. So, another few tips before we end, use captions. Almost, I think, every single one of the different platforms right now has auto-generated captions that you can use. Make sure that you edit them. Make sure that you edit them. Just read through them. Just watch the whole thing one time and make sure that the captions actually get what you're saying because sometimes it picks up things and you're like that is not even kind of close to what I said. So, double check on that before you just blindly post them but use captions. It helps because a lot of people don't watch videos with sound which I get like you don't want people to know when you're pulling up TikTok or pulling up Reels. So, having those auto-generated captions really is helpful for people. As far as using hashtags, use your hashtags. I use hashtags. Every single one of my videos on TikTok has hashtags. You want to be specific, though, with them? I really love it in TikTok especially you can see the numbers. Like you can see the popularity of the hashtags and you can see suggested ones.

[00:25:38.340] - Caroline
So, if I'm talking about Canva, I will do #canva and I will see what other things come up underneath of it as far as trending hashtags or hashtags that have a lot of reach, a lot of videos or that are relevant. And that's how I do my hashtagging. I would recommend avoiding using hashtags that are super generalized. So, you don't want to do something like #fyp which is for your page, or #reels, #tiktok, #popular, #mustsee or whatever it is. You don't want to necessarily just do these super broad ones just to try to get onto people's pages. You want to use ones that are specific because, at the end of the day, we have to remember that this isn't just something that we're just throwing out there. We're not here for the vanity metrics. We're here for the actual growth. We're here for actually getting people onto our email list. That's why all of this matters. It's not just getting those big numbers because at the end of the day, if you don't have a website or a place for people to sign up for your email list, TikTok could go away. Instagram could go away.

[00:26:47.070] - Caroline
YouTube could go away. We don't have control over what those platforms do. But what we do have control over is making sure that we can get our audience onto our email list. We can show our audience all the other things that we have to offer, and that's what I think is most important. And I hope that that makes sense to you today. So, biggest thing for you to remember is to just start. I know that videos can be overwhelming and for a lot of people they really are. If you need some extra support, tag me in your video. Just tag me in the comments or whatever you want to do. I will cheer for you. I will show up in your comment section, and I will cheer for you because I know that this is scary. This is a big, scary thing putting yourself out there. Just start. Just start. And if you need more, I do have Instagram story templates. If you go to carolinevencil.com/ig, I have Instagram story templates that you can use from Canva to make your Instagram stories an easier place for people to sign up for your freebies, for your offers, whatever it is because now everybody has the swipe up feature or the link feature on their stories which I adore.

[00:27:55.270] - Caroline
So I hope that that helped. Thank you guys so much for being here. Thank you for putting up with the fact that my voice sounds kind of like a frog, and I will talk to you guys soon. Bye.
