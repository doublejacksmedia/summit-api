Transcript:
Faith Mariah [00:00:12]:
Hey, guys. Hello. I'm so excited you guys are here. Welcome to the Lazy Bloggers system for achieving success, biz planning to get more results without working more hours. Are you guys excited? I'm excited. I'm gonna walk you guys through my 90 day planning process that I use to manage my multiple six figure business and that I have walked hundreds of people through in my mastermind. So we're gonna do that today. I hope you guys are ready.

Faith Mariah [00:00:36]:
This is a action taking workshop, so this is not hypothetical. We're gonna create your plan right now so get ready, get your pen out, and let's do this. So if we have not met out on these internet streets yet, my name is Faith Mariah. I help stuck online business owners enter their massive action taking era. My team and I run multiple communities where we do challenges, we do trainings, we do, giveaways, we do all kinds of things to help people get out of the should I do this, should I do that, should I do this, should I do that, and to the actual execution. And we really have a lot of tools to help people get more done in less time. That's what I'm all about, if you can't tell from this workshop. I have a social worker background.

Faith Mariah [00:01:17]:
I worked as a social worker for a decade. I used to work with, at risk youth doing wilderness counseling, and I used to work in domestic violence. I built an organic email list with 40,000 subscribers and matched my salary at the University of Florida with my mental health job before I ever became a business coach, so I've been at this a minute. I've done over $700,000 in sales, almost all low ticket. I've coached 100's of people inside the Becoming Boss Mastermind, which is one of my action taking communities we offer. And then I doubled our revenue and cut my hours in half. So there was a year where I set the goal to go from working 40 hours to 20 hours, and I went from a 100,000 to 200,000 using a lot of the things I'm gonna share with you guys today. So I know this stuff works and I'm really excited to share it with you.

Faith Mariah [00:02:04]:
I did bring some gifts for you so if you guys go to www. Faithmariah.com/map you can get a notion board that has all of the links for all of these things. So I have a map you can fill out I'm going to walk you through the map in this workshop but there's an actual map you can actually fill out if you go to this link. And then for bonuses, I brought you guys a 1 page plan. So this is actually a printable document that you can print out and stick on your wall, stick in front of your face. I don't know about you guys, but I'll make plans all the time and forget all about them. Right? And then we get to the end of the year, and we're like, what was my New Year's resolution? I don't know. We don't want that happening here.

Faith Mariah [00:02:44]:
So I got you guys a 1 page plan. I'm gonna give you the complete notes from the long version of this workshop. You guys are getting, like, the the condensed version. The one I originally taught for this workshop was actually over 2 hours long. Obviously, we cannot do that here at this summit, so I'm gonna give you guys a 30 minute version, and I'm gonna give you guys the complete notes from the long version of this workshop at faithmoriah.com/map. It's inside that Notion dashboard. And then I'm gonna be giving you the bonus how to organize your tasks so you can get them done. This is a simple 20 minute training where you can set all your stuff up.

Faith Mariah [00:03:18]:
It's gonna save you a ton of time. And then I'm also just gonna give you guys a coupon code because we I want to, like, and why not? So we will give you guys a coupon code for faithmariashop.com. That's my shop where you can get workshops and templates. We have all kinds of stuff in there. I'll hook you guys up with, like, a pretty substantial discount. I don't know what it's gonna be yet because I haven't made it at the time of recording this, but it'll probably be a pretty, pretty, pretty big discount because I love Liz, and I'm excited to be here. And I just wanna hook you guys up because why not? I have a soft spot in my heart from for bloggers. Right? Because I started as a blogger, so, you know, I wanna help you guys out if I can to get the coupon code, to get the 1 page map, to get the notes from the long workshop.

Faith Mariah [00:04:01]:
Go to faithmoray.com/map, and that will all be there for you guys. So the main thing I want you guys to take away from this workshop is we want to create a plan so that we can minimize time thinking about what to do so we can spend all our time and energy executing. Right? So I see a lot of people that waste a lot of time being like, should I do this? Should I do that? I could do Pinterest. I could do Instagram. Should I do this? Should I do that? We call these energy leaks in my community. Energy leaks tend to happen when you are indecisive. So when you're decisive and you're like, I'm gonna do Pinterest. I'm gonna test for 90 days, you get all that energy back.

Faith Mariah [00:04:39]:
All of the time you spent thinking, all of the energy you felt you spent thinking, all of those emotions that came up when you're like, should I do instead of Instagram? Should I do Pinterest? Should I do Instagram? So and so is doing Instagram. Maybe I should do Instagram. I don't know if Pinterest is working. We're gonna get you we're gonna close that energy leak, and you're gonna get all of that energy back. You're gonna stay razor focused. We're, like, gonna make a plan, and you're gonna put your blinders on so you can spend no time thinking about what to do and all your time executing, right? When I cut my hours from 40 hours to 20 hours and I doubled our revenue this requires a very high level of focus, right? So it's lazy in the sense like you get a lot of energy back, and I think it's actually easier to work this way, but it requires a higher level of thinking and a higher level of focus. Right? So when I was working 40 hours a week, I didn't have to be as strategic. I didn't have to be as focused.

Faith Mariah [00:05:28]:
I didn't have to be as productive. Right? And so I actually love the exercise of, can you guys cut your hours in half and keep your input at the same level? I love that exercise because it makes you start to think, where can I plug these energy leaks? Where am I wasting time? How can I be more efficient? And all those different things. So I know a lot of you guys are thinking that sounds nice but how the heck do I do it? I got you. Don't worry, we're gonna go through the whole thing. So this is the number one thing that I see people that are stuck really, really struggle with. Right? So I spend a lot of time thinking about the people in my community and our students and what's the difference between the people that come in and just are staying stuck and just cannot seem to get momentum and the people that come in and they just blow it out of the water and just really grow their businesses really quickly, what's the difference? And the difference I see, one of the main differences is they the people that are productive become very good decision makers. So a lot of people will spend a lot of time thinking about the decision should I do this, should I do that, I could do this, I could do that, and they think about what they want to do and they think about the strategy. All of that time and energy is time and energy you could spend doing, right? It's not actually doing anything for your business.

Faith Mariah [00:06:43]:
So if I'm spending weeks thinking about should I do Instagram or Pinterest, for example, should I do this niche or that niche, for example, whatever it is for you, instead of spending all that time thinking about that, instead of spending all that time and energy thinking about that, I could just pick 1 and then I could spend all that time and energy thinking about, well, how can I make my graphics awesome in Pinterest? How can I make my blog post more helpful? What is the best kind of content I can make? These are things that actually grow your business forward. Right? Spending time debating trying to do things the right way, spending time debating, to do it the best possible. Right? This is such a good feeling thought for a lot of us, and it sounds so good where it's like, Faith, I wanna make sure I don't waste time and I do everything the right way. Right? Who has that thought? Where are my perfectionists at? I know y'all are out there. Right? It's like, Faith, I I wanna make sure that I do things the right way. I gotta make sure that I'm very thoughtful and I do things in the right way because Because if I make a mistake, that's wasting time, and I don't wanna waste time. Right? But the problem with that thought, if you play that out, like, I wanna make sure I do it the right way. When we think I wanna make sure I do it the right way, that creates a lot of pressure, and pressure usually creates less action, not more action.

Faith Mariah [00:07:53]:
So something I want you guys to tune into is how do I double my output? Right? I wanna output more than I output last week. I wanna output more today than I did yesterday. I wanna output more this month than I did last month, more this year than I did last year. And if I wanna increase my output, having thoughts like I wanna make sure I do everything right is gonna keep you from that goal. Right? It's gonna make you very, very slow. And I always say business loves speed. Right? So can you become a fast decision maker? When I say a good decision maker in entrepreneurship, I just mean fast decisions. Okay? The other thing that we wanna do to become a good decision maker is you don't remake decisions.

Faith Mariah [00:08:32]:
Everybody say it with me. We make decisions one time. We do not remake decisions. Okay? So we're gonna make a bunch of decisions in this workshop today. I hope you guys are ready. One of the biggest thought errors I see people have is that if I spend more time thinking about a decision, if I spend more time reading articles about a decision, that means that I'll have a better shot of making a better decision. And I just really wanna challenge that whole idea because there's a lot of factors in business and life that we don't know. There's a lot of unknown.

Faith Mariah [00:09:04]:
Right? Somebody asked me the other day, they're like, what's the best platform right now? And they had spent weeks researching all these platforms and they're like, I'm really trying to figure out the best one. And I was like, well, it doesn't really matter because a year from now, all of it's going to be different anyway because of AI and everything is changing. But everything in all these industries is changing, right? So you could spend weeks finding the best platform, and it's Right? So you could spend weeks finding the best platform, and it could be sold next year and everything could change. It could, get banned. Right? We've seen the TikTok ban stuff. Like, you don't know what's gonna happen. There's all these unknown variables. So you spending a lot of time researching, you spending a lot of time thinking about it.

Faith Mariah [00:09:38]:
Unfortunately, we're not fortune tellers. Right? I always tell my community. I'm like, if y'all are fortune tellers, just go play the lotto. It's a lot easier than growing a business. But if we're not fortune tellers, we don't know what's gonna happen in the future. So spending time in the present thinking, thinking, thinking, there's so many unknown variables that you don't know, and spending more time thinking about a decision doesn't mean the decision is better. It just means you are slow, and business loves speed. Okay? It's gonna eliminate shiny object chasing.

Faith Mariah [00:10:05]:
So when you make a decision and you make a decision once, right, so we're gonna do this in this workshop. Maybe I decide my strategy is gonna be Pinterest, and that's what I'm gonna do when I see old Instagram Jessica business coach up there saying how she makes a bajillion dollars every 2 minutes over on TikTok, I'm not really tempted by that because I already made my decision to try this platform. We make 90 day decisions in my community, so you're gonna make a 90 day plan in this workshop. So you're gonna test it for 90 days. You're just gonna pin if your if your decision is Pinterest, we're gonna pin for 90 days. And then at the end of 90 days, you look at the data. Okay? And then you, based on the data, change your plan. What I see a lot of people do that stay very, very stuck is they change their plan all the time to feel better.

Faith Mariah [00:10:51]:
This looks like this looks like this. Okay? It's like I'm I'm working on my stuff. I make my plan. I'm doing Pinterest. I'm writing my blog post. I feel good. I'm like, oh, I love my plan. Like, Faith Mariah is awesome.

Faith Mariah [00:11:02]:
I'm sure all of you are gonna think that. Right? They're like, I've got my plan. I'm so excited. This is gonna work. This is gonna be great. And then you do it for, like, a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and maybe you're not getting any results, and then the thoughts start changing, right? So it starts being like, I don't know if it's working. I don't know if it's ever going to work. If it's not working out, it might not ever work, right? And so your belief goes down and then when your belief goes down, that feels bad to a lot of us.

Faith Mariah [00:11:29]:
And so then what a lot of people will do is they'll change their strategy to build their belief back up. So they'll be like, I'm gonna go on TikTok. Right? And they'll be like, oh my gosh. This is gonna work. It's working for so and so. This is gonna be great. This is amazing. And their belief goes back up, but it feels really good.

Faith Mariah [00:11:42]:
Who's done this? Right? I call this, like, strategy hopping. So it's so shiny object syndrome, like, whatever you wanna call it. Right? It's like belief goes down. I'm gonna try a new strategy. You guys are not, chasing shiny objects and strategy grabbing when you think what you're doing is gonna work. It's always when your belief is low. And guess what? When your belief is low is the worst time to make decisions for your business. Right? Don't make strategic decisions from a place of, oh my god.

Faith Mariah [00:12:08]:
I don't think this is working. What if this doesn't happen? I've wasted all this time. I've wasted all this money. Don't make strategic business decisions from that place. Okay? Those are emotional decisions. They're not based on data. So we're gonna collect data for 90 days, and and then we're gonna look at the stats on Pinterest. We're gonna look at what's happening on the website, and then we're gonna make a decision about, do I want to keep testing this strategy for 90 more days, or do I wanna try something else? And that's a strategy based decision.

Faith Mariah [00:12:34]:
Right? Because now we're looking at data. We're looking at numbers. We have some things to base our decision on. Yeah. You're still gonna have to guess at a lot of things in business. Right? Even the data is not always gonna paint a clear picture for you, But it's a lot better to look at data and make an intellectual's decision about your business strategy than, like, get all scared and freaked out and then pivot and do something weird. Right? Who's done this? I've seen people do this with niches, right, where my niche hoppers out. It's like, oh my god.

Faith Mariah [00:13:00]:
I'm gonna do financing. Oh my god. I'm gonna do this. I don't think it's working. I don't think it's working. Oh my god. I'm gonna do this other one. Right? We I see this with, strategies, right, with platforms, all these different things.

Faith Mariah [00:13:10]:
So I love the 90 day planning because it speeds you up at execution and slows you down at doing weird stuff, slows you down at shiny object taking, slows you down at, like, all those weird little pivots. We're just gonna delete all of those. Right? So if we create the 90 day plan and you commit to following it for 90 days, we're deleting indecision. You're not gonna have to think about what to do. You're just gonna sit down. You're gonna know exactly what task you need to do. Think about how much energy you would get back if if you knew every time you sit down exactly what you had to do and you didn't have to sit there thinking, should I do this? Should I do that? I could do this. I could do that.

Faith Mariah [00:13:43]:
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna delete all of that. Right? We're gonna delete, all of the, like, should I try a different strategy? Maybe I should do this. We're gonna delete all of that. We're gonna get all of that energy back to put into our business on things that actually move it forward. Right.

Faith Mariah [00:13:56]:
All of that stuff, like I said, is just energy leaks. So here we go. We're going to create your plan right now. Everybody put your decision making hat on, okay? And I want everybody to think about making a decision and making it fast is a lot better than being slow. And and I wanna become a fast decision maker. Right? When I see all the entrepreneurs I know that make a lot of money, they're pretty fast decision makers. They test a lot of things. They are willing to fail.

Faith Mariah [00:14:26]:
They're willing to be a beginner. Right? So a lot of the stuff when we're changing strategies too is, like, we feel cringey or embarrassed and, like, we wanna do really good. You guys should not try to do good. If you're just starting, be bad at it. Be a beginner. Just tell your brain, like, look, I'm gonna be bad at it. I'm gonna test it for 90 days. I'm gonna make a bunch of decisions, and I'm gonna see what happens.

Faith Mariah [00:14:44]:
You guys with me? So here we go. We're gonna make your business plan right now. I'm gonna walk you guys through 2 main things. Okay. We're gonna fill out your strategy map, and we're gonna create your execution plan. So we're gonna start with your strategy map. Here we go. So here's your strategy map.

Faith Mariah [00:15:00]:
Yes, I was very pleased with myself with my graphics, where my graphic design challenge people at. Okay, when I make something cute, I'm very excited excited because I don't feel like I'm very good at graphics, but I thought this was freaking adorable. So this is your guys' strategy map. I'm gonna take you through it. We're gonna make decisions and nail all this down right now. You're gonna figure out how are people gonna find you. I'm always like, people cannot pay you if they don't know you exist. Right? We gotta get your offer in front of people that might wanna buy it.

Faith Mariah [00:15:26]:
How are we gonna do that? Once they find you, right, and by find you, I really mean I want them on your email list. Okay? So by find you, it's like they know you exist. They sign up for your email list. Once they're on your email list, we wanna get them free results. Right? I always say, like, you should not expect people to just take your word that you can help them. You should not expect people to just trust you just because. Like, you have to earn people's trust now more than ever online. And the best way to earn people's trust is, like, I don't expect you guys to just believe I can help you grow your business, right, because I say I can.

Faith Mariah [00:15:59]:
I'm like, I'm gonna do it in front of your face. Like, come to my workshop. Come to my free training. Come to my free events. Me and my team are gonna get you results for real. And, like, you don't have to take my word for it. I'm gonna do it right in front of your face. Right? So you can do this.

Faith Mariah [00:16:12]:
There's a lot of different ways you can do this. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm gonna take you through all the ways. And then the final destination is buyer island. Okay? And we want we want these people to eventually become buyers. So people are finding you. You're nurturing them. Some of them are gonna buy.

Faith Mariah [00:16:27]:
Okay? That's the process, and I'm gonna take you through exactly what that looks like in each step. And you're gonna leave this workshop with a clear plan for each of these. Your strategy map done, right? Again, I have this in the Notion dashboard for you guys that I made. So if you want the Notion dashboard, it's faithmariah.com/map. We're going to decide right now. We got decision making on your head. Okay, Strategy map. Here we go.

Faith Mariah [00:16:52]:
We want to decide, pick at least 1. For those of you that are new, just pick 1. I always say this is like juggling, like strategy is kind of like juggling, right? So once you get one of these to work, maybe I'm gonna learn, Instagram reels this quarter, right, or Instagram threads. Let's say I'm gonna do Instagram threads, and I'm gonna go all in on learning everything I can about it, becoming really great at it, kind of finding my footing over there. Once I have that, then I can add in another little juggling ball. Right? So maybe then I'm gonna add in reels or I'm gonna add in LinkedIn. Right? And you can add as you go. But if you don't have any of these working, you just need to pick 1 and, like, obsess over it.

Faith Mariah [00:17:33]:
What I'll see a lot of people do is they start reusing content and dabbling all around, and they don't actually go deep enough on any platform. I would much rather you guys become obsessed with 1 and just learn everything there is to do with LinkedIn, every single thing. I'm gonna learn every single thing that's working over there. I'm gonna learn all the different strategies. I'm gonna start following people over there. I'm gonna start consuming content over there. I'm gonna create a ton of stuff over there. I'm gonna test a whole bunch of stuff, and I'm gonna be obsessed with one platform.

Faith Mariah [00:17:59]:
So pick your one obsession platform. Okay. These are the main ways I'm seeing people do this right now. There's always exceptions to every rule, but I do work with a lot of people. I have hundreds of clients and hundreds of students, so, you know, this is not based on nothing. Generally, you guys will be in one of these these places. Okay? You'll either be on TikTok, Instagram reels. Not Instagram on the grid yet.

Faith Mariah [00:18:24]:
I do see carousels starting to come back and get some reach but not as much as Reels still. LinkedIn, I'm seeing people getting traction on LinkedIn where their LinkedIn is actually putting their content in front of people because they want content creators over there. Instagram threads is an amazing opportunity. I'm seeing a lot of my students get traction over there right now. All of these change, by the way. So where the organic reach is and where kind of the best place is to get new people and get new eyeballs on your stuff changes all the time. So don't be attached to, like, this is my strategy and it's gonna be my strategy till I die. It's like this is my strategy for now until the platform changes, then I'm gonna have to do something else.

Faith Mariah [00:18:59]:
Right? The online space is an inherently unstable place, meaning it changes all the time. Right? This is what I'm saying about you need to just become a fast decision maker because I can debate on this and research on this and think about this all day. And then if TikTok gets deleted, like, all that research was for nothing. Right? So So we don't know what's gonna happen in the future and all these platforms are very unstable. They're sold all the time. They merge all the time. They close down all the time. The reach changes.

Faith Mariah [00:19:29]:
The algorithm changes. Everything changes. So LinkedIn, I'm seeing people having really good looks, really good reach on threads. Ads, I don't usually recommend people start with ads. The only exception I really have to that is if you have a high paying job and you do not have a lot of time, you can substitute ads as a way for people to find you. So you don't have to mess with social media. You don't have to do any of that. You have to spend the time and money to learn ads, which is not a small investment.

Faith Mariah [00:19:57]:
But then once you know how to do it, you can use that to drive traffic. But most of us be bootstrapping our businesses out here. Right? I get it because that's how I did my business too. So I don't usually recommend you guys start doing ads until you have a really great sales system, and you're like, if I could get in front of more people, I know I would have more buyers. Right? Until you have that sales system, running ads is kinda gonna be flushing money. Okay? Collaboration. So doing things like this, I'm collaborating with Liz right now, doing summits, doing bundles. We host bundles all the time.

Faith Mariah [00:20:27]:
You can go to faithmariahevents.com. We're almost always recruiting for our bundles. I'd love to have you in them. Google. So this is blogging. Right? So most of you are probably going to want to be over on Google or Pinterest to get eyeballs on your blog. Right? And then YouTube. I'm still seeing people get a lot of traffic over on YouTube.

Faith Mariah [00:20:44]:
So you're going to pick these pick one of these right now. Okay? Because we're going to go on to the next part. So how are people going to find you? They can't pay you if they don't know you exist. Where are we going to be? You're probably gonna be picking one of these. There are exceptions to that, but generally this is the places I'm seeing people, that is working the best. Okay. We're trucking along our little map. We're at free results, right, so we're gonna get people results ahead of time.

Faith Mariah [00:21:10]:
We're gonna nurture them. We're gonna prove we can help them. We're not gonna expect them to think we can help them until we help them. We're not gonna expect them to wanna buy from us until we prove we know what we're doing, right? So this is difficult to do because it's not just like vomiting tons of free information. It's like can you take someone and get them to take an action and get a different result in their life? That is hard to do, right? It takes a lot of, encouragement. It takes a lot of follow-up. It takes a lot of all of the things. Okay? So I want you to pick one of these for your strategy map.

Faith Mariah [00:21:45]:
You can do email. I think you should do email with video. So I've been shooting Loom videos, and then I will upload it onto YouTube unlisted, screenshot it in the email because you can't attach a video in an email. I'll screenshot, like, so it looks like the video is there, and then I'll link to that YouTube. So when they click on it, it doesn't play the video, although it looks like it would. It actually takes them over to YouTube. I think people need to see your face and hear your voice. I think it's more and more difficult to just sell on email when people have not seen and heard from you.

Faith Mariah [00:22:15]:
I know a lot of you guys are not gonna like that. I was terrified of being on camera when I started. I swore I would never be on camera. I totally get it. But I'm just being straight with you. Like, it is harder to do sales online and the old ways of just sending emails and people will buy things. It's not really like that anymore unless you have a way of getting a ton a ton of value or value? A ton of ton of volume. So if you can get you know, you're getting thousands and thousands of leads a day, probably some of those people will just buy off of email.

Faith Mariah [00:22:43]:
Right? But if we have a small audience and we're really trying to convert a lot of people, I would start including emails with your videos. So if you're doing a newsletter, just open up Loom. Right? Shoot a video. Say, hey, guys. Like, you know, in the newsletter, I was talking about blah blah blah. This is how it could look, this is whatever, do a little pep talk, give them some encouragement, give them some tips, like, it can be it should be less than 2 minutes, like, short. Okay? YouTube is still great for nurture, so what this looks like is you would keyword those YouTube videos if we were doing it for the people find you. We have to keyword them so they show up in search.

Faith Mariah [00:23:19]:
And then if we're using it as nurture, you take that link and email it to your list, and you do a good pitch in the email about I just made this YouTube video. Like, this is why you should watch it. This is how it's gonna help you. Are you struggling with x, y, and z? A lot of people that I work with struggle with this. I just shot a video. You guys can watch it for free right here. So then we're sending them to our YouTube video to learn from us so we can get them those results ahead of time. They can get to know us, right? We got to build up that know, like and trust factor.

Faith Mariah [00:23:49]:
And then podcasting, same thing, right? Do the podcast, send it to your email list. Instagram stories are a great way to show people behind the scenes of your life, especially if you're using Instagram threads or reels. This goes really nice with that. But you can do it the same thing. You can do Instagram stories and then tell your email list, hey, I've been sharing over on my stories, 5 ways to never struggle with whatever again. Go watch today's videos. I'm going to be more tomorrow. So you've got to be giving them a good reason to go consume this stuff.

A Facebook group. The Facebook group is not really working very well for getting new people to find you, but if people are joining your email list, we can send them to the Facebook group. So we can do a free workshop every Monday, a mini workshop. It's going to be less than 5 minutes. It's going to get you big results. I do it every single Monday over in my Facebook group and then every Monday you're gonna put that pitch in an email and send it to your list and send them over to your Facebook group. And then something else, like maybe you guys have a different idea. There's lots of different niches.

Faith Mariah [00:24:53]:
There's lots of different ways to do this stuff, but you need to regularly, I would say weekly at least, be sending something very valuable to the people on your list, right? The more you do this, valuable to the people on your list, right? The more you do this and the better you get at this, the easier it is to convert the people that find you into buyers, right? The best way to get better at this is to practice. Don't try to do it the right way. Be willing to be a beginner. Some of you guys are going to be beginner. Some of you guys are gonna be bad at this. Okay? It's okay. Everybody's bad at bad in the beginning, I promise, and you'll get better over time. So pick one right now for your map.

Faith Mariah [00:25:25]:
How are you gonna nurture people? Where are you gonna do it? I got to get going fast because I have a bunch of slides, but the last piece you need to pick is what you're going to sell. So the most important part of this is you need to know the problem your people have that they want to pay to fix, The problem they have that they want to pay to fix. A lot of entrepreneurs I see that stay stuck are trying to solve a problem people don't know they have. They're trying to solve a problem for people that don't have money. I would not build a business solving those problems. I would solve a problem people know they have and they want to pay to fix. Okay. People will pay money for entertainment, right? So the problem you would be solving is essentially boredom or being uninspired.

Faith Mariah [00:26:05]:
Right? So figure out the problem you solve that people want to pay to fix and then the format for that solution. So a lot of people are like, do I do a course? Do I do coaching? Do I do a workbook? Do I do product? It doesn't really matter as much as do you have a problem you can solve that people want to pay to fix And then you can deliver it whatever way you want. You could do a private podcast. You could do a workshop. You could do a challenge. You could do done for you. Like, I'm gonna literally do this for you, whatever you want. And then you need to decide when and how you will sell it, when and how you will sell it.

Faith Mariah [00:26:37]:
And again, this is in the Notion dashboard. faithmariah.com/map. I got to get a move on, but I want you guys to decide these three questions. Okay. Problem you solve, format you solve it in, when and how you're going to sell it. Okay. So that's your strategy map. You need to have that.

Faith Mariah [00:26:55]:
You need to have that. I cannot stress enough. Like, please do not work on your business without having that done because you're going to waste so much time. So have that done. We're going to test it for 90 days, and I'm going to get you you through this execution plan super fast. So the execution plan, you're gonna do this for each step. So you're gonna go through find you, what are you doing, how often are you doing it, when are you gonna do it, and where will you keep track of it. Again, all these questions are in the Notion dashboard.

Faith Mariah [00:27:21]:
You're gonna do that for your find you, your free results, your buy. I have a example on the next slide. So for each part of the strategy map, you need to create an execution plan. Here's what that looks like for the first step. So the first step is people find you, right? What are you doing? This person is going to do blog posts and they're going to post them on Pinterest. Okay. That's how people are going to find them. That first step.

Faith Mariah [00:27:44]:
How often are you doing it? They're going to do weekly blog posts and they're going to post on Pinterest 2 times a day. When are you going to do it? Weekly blog posts. They're going to write on the weekend and schedule it to go live on Monday. When are you going to do it? Pinterest 2 times per day. They're going to do it after work. Okay. So what are you doing? How often are you doing it? When are you going to do it? And where will you keep track of it? So you need to have somewhere all this stuff lives so that you're not sitting down thinking, do I need to do a blog post today? Do I need to do Pinterest? Do I need to send an email? You're going to put all those tasks in a scheduling system. You're going to open that scheduling system when you sit down on your computer and just follow that list.

Faith Mariah [00:28:26]:
And that's how you can cut your hours. If you are serious about wanting to get more done in less time, you have to have somewhere where you can organize your tasks and you'll spend no time deciding what to do and all of your time executing. Okay? If you're like, I have no idea how to organize my tasks, how to structure that, I have a free training that I show you how to set this up using Google tools, which are all free, and I'm gonna put the link in the faithmariah.com/map so it's in that Notion web page for you guys, and you need to go through and make your execution plan. We just did the find you section. You're still gonna need to do the free results and the buyer. But I promise you, if you can make that plan and then start sticking to it, you're gonna be blown away at what you can get done this year. If you spend time dabbling around, not knowing what to do, being confused, being slow at making decisions, you know, you're going to spend a lot of time making very little progress. If you make this plan and you just concentrate on executing your tasks every day that you plan to do, that's a skill you have to build.

Faith Mariah [00:29:29]:
Right? You have to start building the discipline and the skill of sitting down at your computer, opening your plan and following your task list. So go to faithmariah.com/map if you want the free Google training, and I show you how to set up your plan in Google step by step. It's really easy, and like I said, these are all free tools. Okay. That's it. I hope this was helpful. If this is helpful to you, I would love to hear your comments if you like it. I'm just recording this in my room by myself, so it helps me know that you guys like this stuff.
