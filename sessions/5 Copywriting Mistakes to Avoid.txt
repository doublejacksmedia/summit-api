I know that as a blogger or even if you don't have your own blog and you're blogging for someone else, the conversion rates mean everything. Conversion rates, you know, are how you get or how you're getting paid. How your client's getting paid so that means everything. And engagement has a lot to do with it with conversion.

This is for you, if you're a blogger or writer who wants more clicks, greater subscribers or engagement, is struggling with finding the right words to say, you're absolutely done with no leads and no clients and ready to quickly apply tips to take your copy from bla to your readers saying "I can't take my eyes off of this." And you're ready to position yourself to make a huge difference in your tribe's lives. I am Portia Wofford, I'm a nurse, a writer and marketing pro.

[00:02:09.670] - Portia
I'm the founder of the PWagency, which is a content marketing firm, and this is why you should listen to me. I'm a self-taught copywriter, when my teachers told me to use my words, I turned them into an entire exhibit in the middle school library. That's a very true story. I discovered I had a knack for connecting people to my words when I won my first for a speaking contest in fourth grade. I have 10 plus years as a nurse.

[00:02:36.350] - Portia
Learn how to untangle healthcare and medical terminology, terminology to drastically decrease my patients rehospitalization rate and educate entire nursing departments. I've written engaging and high performing content for various platforms, and I help health care brands grow with the power of words. But most importantly, I am a roll tide yelling girl from Alabama. So roll tide, roll. If we have any University of Alabama fans out there. So let's get down to the nitty gritty of copyrighting mistakes before we get started. I want to make sure that we're on the same page as far as writing is concerned.

[00:03:15.970] - Portia
Copywriting of course, we know it uses emotion and human psychology to connect and Convert with readers. But for bloggers and writers, copywriting is about placing your content strategically. You want to persuade readers to trust you, engage with you or follow a call to action. Number one [mistake], you don't know your keywords, you have to start with the keyword research, you have to ask yourself, what are my readers Googling? If you are writing for other clients, if you're a blogger who blogs for your clients, you need to ask yourself what are my clients or readers, Googling. Keyword research helps you spend time making content that focuses on those words or phrases will deliver for your most targeted prospect.

[00:04:02.540] - Portia
When you target specific words and phrases. You have a better chance of ranking higher on Google, Yahoo, Bing whatever search engine you're trying to write for, for content that includes those words and phrases. You're going to think of keywords and keyword phrases as clues. You want to make sure that you use keywords in the title or the headline of your piece. Also use in the first paragraph of the piece if you're writing, in just a few words your, the search engines will be able to tell what your piece is about.

[00:04:31.970] - Portia
And what happens is that they see certain key words or phrases and whether, you know, when they're crawling or they're crawling and indexing, say, hey, you know, she's writing about X, Y and Z. I've seen this before. People are searching. They've let me put this up a little higher in the search engine. You can write tons of amazing content, I want I want you to hone in on this, right, tons of amazing content.

[00:04:57.870] - Portia
You can be the best in the world, but if it's not optimized to write for terms that your target audience or your target reader is searching for then no one is going to read it. No one is going to find it. So make sure you take some time to research what terms you want to be high for, research work, what keywords or phrases people are searching for.

[00:05:25.330] - Portia
[mistake] Number two, you're talking about or to yourself too much, to be blunt here, it's not about you.

[00:05:34.090] - Portia
Everything is not about you. It's about your reader, your readers voice. We tend to use our own terms and terminology and lingo when we're writing, especially if we had another vision before we became bloggers or writers. So like me, I'm a nurse. A lot of my clients are nurses or healthcare entrepreneurs and they tend to write or talk the same way that they would talk if they were talking to your colleague. But those people are not their ideal client, so they can't write in that same voice.

[00:06:04.330] - Portia
You need to write in a way your reader can understand. Use everyday speak. Make sure your copy is conversational to your reader. Use the word "you" don't write too much about "I" or "we" in your content.

[00:06:18.260] - Portia
Make sure that you're speaking the language that they speak, if they use contractions when when they write. OK, you might want to consider using contractions when you speak, when you write. If they use the "but" and "and" at the beginning of a sentence, that they use ellipses, it's OK to use all of these things. Just make sure that you use their language, their phrases, and not yours.

[00:06:45.450] - Portia
This is Calandra, Calandra is a mathematician and she has a company where she tutors kids all the way from pre-k to college students to a graduate level student, anything about math,  you need to know anything about math? She can help you. She has a master's degree in math and mathematics, when Calandra came to me. She was using a lot of content that she would use if she were speaking to another master's prepared mathematician. It was not optimized for her ideal client and she was not getting conversion, which was not converting. So we optimize her content. We changed the language a little bit. We wrote some flyers and some blog posts and within three days of, the first day alone, she got 5 appointments scheduled and a week later she had eight sessions within three local cities.

[00:07:35.760] - Portia
All we did was changed the way she talked. Just change the tone. We make sure that we use her ideal client's language.

[00:07:45.810] - Portia
[mistake] Number three, you're not targeting your readers pain point or problems. No one cares about you. Everybody wants to know about the benefits of the product or service you are offering. How are you helping the reader? You need to address them. Answer their questions. Make sure that you keep an individual person in mind when you're writing, because if you're writing for one person, you're talking to one person you, write for one person, you're solving one person's problem.

[00:08:16.070] - Portia
Keep it individualized and then convert, convince and convert to tell a story. You're going to build a relationship. You're going to push yourself and the reader too. These people want to know that you can stop, solve their problem, they want to know what they're going to get out of reading your blog, what they're going to get out of reading this article. They're going to get out of this blog post, that's beneficial to them.

[00:08:46.110] - Portia
[mistake] Number four your structure is off, structure is so important, it makes things easier to read.

[00:08:51.510] - Portia
It breaks it up because we all know that people have short attention spans so it breaks that keep your attention on the article, on the blog post, on the page you're going to use bullets. You can make your style consistent. How do you make yourself consistent? You're going to style how your bullets make sure that your bullets match the pre-frame of the bullet. So in other words, if you started with, you're about to learn, if each bullet needs to be readable, whether it be consistent with your bullet punctuation. Some bullets end in punctuation, some don't. It's your preference however you want to do it but just be consistent [inaudible 00:09:27] however you start is how you need to finish.

[00:09:29.700] - Portia
Make sure that your indentation and spacing is consistent throughout. Use white space, don't use choppy long sentences, break sentences up into two, three or four, if you can, if have to, it's OK to use broken in one word sentences, if that's how your reader talks. If that's optimize to your reader, your client. That's fine. Use headlines and subheadlines these are the same things as header tags. Use active and passive voice when your reader is reading. They should be able to get the sense of what your whole blog is about just by reading your subheads.

[00:10:07.150] - Portia
While most readers probably won't notice that you have misstyling, almost all your readers will notice if you have bad style, or inconsistent style and so make sure that you're consistent with your structure, that you're consistent with your style throughout. And this is a little, you know, kind of like a little white space here to kind of break it up, make sure that everyone is still with me, I still have everyone's attention.

[00:10:32.660] - Portia
[mistake] Number five, your copy is hard to read, readability is important, readability is the ease with which a reader can understand your text. In the United States the average readability score is a seven/eighth grade level. So most people are comfortable reading text that is understood by 11 to 13 year olds. Here are some tools that you can use the common readability score. You simply copy paste your text into these tools and it will give you your readability score.

[00:11:01.680] - Portia
Good copy builds trust and improves your brand recognition, establishes a strong brand identity, helps influence conversions, optimize content, helps improve your SEO. And we know SEO is important for ranking, is important for making sure you rank higher and faster on those search engines and copy increases engagement and visibility, which equals more leads, which equals more clients, which equals more money in your wallet.

[00:11:27.450] - Portia
And good copy just simply proves that you have the secret sauce. So how does a blog or blog post convert? Step one, people search for answers that go into a search engine, they type in keywords, phrases, and questions. Number two your blog or your blog post answers the questions. Number three, the reader wants the solution because they understand that you answered the question, so how, does content become money? Your content sends the reader to a website where the solution is offered. So if you are a blogger and you have a lot of affiliate partnerships, you want to make sure you're optimizing because you want to take advantage of this.

[00:12:06.360] - Portia
Number two, you properly identify the problem, and since you properly identified the problem for reader and you have the answer as well. You know, they have this problem. So, hey, is a possibility that you can have the solution to the problem. Number three, a blogger, a post has easy to follow calls to action. You tell them exactly what to do next. Click here. If you want to learn more, click here. If you want to buy x, y, z.  Schedule your call here, schedule your discovery call here, you make it easy, it's laid out in black and white ABC one, two, three it's easy to understand. There's no confusion about it at all.
