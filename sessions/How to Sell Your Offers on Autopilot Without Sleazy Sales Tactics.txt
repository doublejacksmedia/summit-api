Hey there, and welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. My name is Dr. Destini Copp, and I am so very excited that you selected my presentation to watch during the Summit. And I'm also excited that you're interested in learning about how to sell your offers on autopilot without any sleazy sales tactics. Now, when I'm talking about your offers, I'm really talking about anything that you want to sell in your business whether it's a low cost digital product, an online course, a membership, a service that you're doing, or maybe even some type of coaching program.

[00:00:47.410] - Dr. Destini Copp
So really, any type of offer would fall within this category. Now, I do have a free gift for you, so do not leave without grabbing it. It is called Plan Your Profitable Evergreen Sales Funnel. And I'm going to walk you through how to kind of map it out for your business and set it up in general with this free gift. So definitely check that out before you go today.

[00:01:12.660] - Dr. Destini Copp
Now, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Dr. Destini Copp. I'm a college marketing professor turned online entrepreneur. I'm the host of the Creators MBA Podcast in the Digital Product Growth Summit. And my superpower is helping business owners craft growth strategies with digital products and sales funnels.

[00:01:32.340] - Dr. Destini Copp
I'm CEO of several different businesses my personal brand which has been out there for many years which is destinicop.com. I also have a Shopify store called hellocontent.shop. And that's where you can find a lot of different content for your business that you can use in your courses to create courses, to create memberships, lead magnets, and just use in marketing in your business and then also wrote -- can't even talk. I also own a brand called HobbyScool.

[00:02:05.180] - Dr. Destini Copp
And in HobbyScool, we do online learning virtual summits about all types of different hobbies. So think about, like, art journaling, crafting, needleworking, quilting, I mean just a ton of different hobbies. We love everything hobbies at HobbyScool. And I also have a Shopify store for HobbyScool. Also -- and you can reach me on most social media platforms @destinicopp.

[00:02:33.300] - Dr. Destini Copp
Quite frankly, I'm most active on LinkedIn, but you can reach me on the other platforms also. Now, here is why I focus mostly on digital products and automated sales funnels as my main revenue stream in my businesses. Now, I have other things, as you mentioned, I have the Shopify stores. I also do a little bit of one-on-one type coaching, but my main income comes from these passive income.

[00:03:06.470] - Dr. Destini Copp
I'll say passive, they're still work, but passive income digital products and automated sales funnels and it really stems from an event that happened in my life when I was at WaterColor with my family. And if you've ever been down to WaterColor, Florida which is kind of near like Destin Seaside, that area, it's on 30A in Florida and the water absolutely does look like this. So, if you've ever been there

[00:03:32.710] - Dr. Destini Copp
you know it's beautiful, absolutely beautiful there. My family was going down to the beach, and at that point in time, I was a Facebook ads manager and a client that I was working on in his Facebook ads, in his mind, were not performing as well as they should, and quite frankly, what we found out after, you know, after that big hoohah there it just that the price had gone up, right, for the Facebook ads -- just price had increased.

[00:04:00.150] - Dr. Destini Copp
There was a lot of demand during that time that he was running his event, but I had to stay back and not go to the beach with my family. We paid a lot of money for this beach vacation, and I had to work on his Facebook ads. And I came back from that vacation, I said absolutely never, never again. I'm never doing that again, and that's when I kind of left the service work, if you would.

[00:04:23.030] - Dr. Destini Copp
And I said, I'm going all in on digital products, and fast forward several years later it has been one of the best decisions that I have ever made. So my life now is around 95 percent passive income which is coming from the digital product revenue and affiliate marketing. I do a lot of affiliate marketing also, and you can see this is the ThriveCart account for one of our funnels that we ran this summer.

[00:04:52.350] - Dr. Destini Copp
Again, this was one of the funnels. Now we were -- the caveat here is we were driving traffic to this, so this just didn't magically happen. But as you can see, this is through all low-cost digital products. And I'm going to walk you through what exactly was in this funnel just so you can know that it can be done even with low-cost digital products. So here's what we're going to cover in this presentation today

[00:05:17.660] - Dr. Destini Copp
I'm going to talk about what are sales funnels and the strategic advantage that they offer. I'm going to go behind the scenes of what a sales funnel looks like and some of the tools that I use for these funnels, but also, which I think is very important, is how you can add a personal touch and ethical practices into these automated sales funnels. Now, I'm -- as we go through this, I'm going to be using the word automated, evergreen, autopilot it all means the same thing.

[00:05:49.460] - Dr. Destini Copp
It just means it's a funnel that's automated that you set up and you kind of set it and forget it to some extent. I mean, you still need to go in, monitor it, make sure it's working, make sure your -- everything's converting properly, but you're not messing with it on a daily basis. And then, which is very important, we're going to talk about traffic strategies to get eyeballs on your funnel. Now, if you're a blogger and you've built up a good base of like your email list, you might already have some of those strategies in place so you might not have a lot of work to do

[00:06:23.770] - Dr. Destini Copp
there. So let me talk about a little bit more about what do I mean by automated sales funnel. So it means a funnel that's always ready to sell. It saves you time, right. It keeps people interested, so you're giving them a quick win. And I'm going to walk you through what I mean by that as we go through this.

[00:06:45.960] - Dr. Destini Copp
And you're really using that funnel to initiate and to build that relationship with them whether it's through a free gift that you're offering or a low cost digital product. And one of the things that I love about these automated funnels is with these low cost digital products you're giving people a way to say, you know, an easy yes to something that you have to offer. And when they say -- give you -- when you -- when you give them an opportunity to say an easy yeah -- yes, they're going to get to know you better because people tend to if they buy something, they're generally going to consume it. Right? And then that puts them in a position if they really like what you did, they like what you had to offer that puts them in a position for, you know, when you have something higher price to sell down the road, they're more likely to buy with you and it doesn't break their bank. Right?

[00:07:35.700] - Dr. Destini Copp
Like I said, it's an easy yes, and it also gives them an opportunity to kind of grow with your business. So you have some type of value offer, right, that you can set up with these automated and evergreen sales funnels that they can, you know, buy with you month after month or, you know, however often that you have offers that are available to them. I can tell you in HobbyScool, we have people that come to our online learning virtual summits. Every time we offer one and they purchase it, they're like, yes, this is something I know. I love this.

[00:08:10.340] - Dr. Destini Copp
I want to buy from you. So it definitely works out. Now, here's an example of one of these automated sales funnels. So somebody in the, you know, in the first kind of up at the top left here they are going to be buying or sign -- not buying, but signing up for your free offer. Now, in this case, it was a summit that we were doing.

[00:08:34.180] - Dr. Destini Copp
Doesn't have to be. I have tons of -- I have a lot of these funnels that I've set up where it was just a free gift. Maybe it was some templates that I had. Maybe it is -- I'm trying to think of some of the ones that I have set up today.

[00:08:50.010] - Dr. Destini Copp
Templates work very well for us. One is like a planner. So the free gift is a planner that works very well for us. So they sign up for your free gift, and then on that next page that is where you have your tripwire offer. So really a tripwire offer is just a really low cost type offer that makes it easy for them to say yes to, so an example in one -- 

[00:09:18.050] - Dr. Destini Copp
and I'll give you an example for the free gift that I have for you today. So on the next page, after you sign up for the free gift, which is a planner to plan your profitable evergreen sales funnel, on the next place you're in  get a really awesome offer for our Evergreen Funnel course. So if you're interested in actually setting up an evergreen funnel that will be on that next page, and then from there let's say somebody clicks and say they want to buy, then you'll go to a checkout. Now, I use ThriveCart for all of this, not for all -- not for the landing pages.

[00:09:51.940] - Dr. Destini Copp
I use Leadpages for the free gift and the tripwire sales page. But once they click to purchase, then that takes me to ThriveCart and on ThriveCart, on the checkout page, you'll have the offer, but then you also have a little order bump. So a little order bump might be a $7 offer or a $9 offer or whatever something that complements your tripwire offer your main offer that you're giving them but just adds a little bit more to it. So it's again a really easy yes.

[00:10:21.270] - Dr. Destini Copp
So then they have two offers right there that they can purchase from you, and then from there depending on what you have to sell, and we'll go into some examples with that in this presentation, you can have other upsells or downsells there and then they go to checkout. You give them the order confirmation emails. But even if, let me just say, even if they don't go on to buy anything else from you, they're still on your email list. Right?

[00:10:46.590] - Dr. Destini Copp
So you're still going to send them out an email welcome sequence where you still can promote some of these other offers if they didn't buy. So this generally what it looks like there. So let's talk about some of the tech tools, and I kind of hinted at them just a second ago, but for your landing page, for your free gift, and for your sales page, I use Leadpages. The other thing I like about Leadpages is it has that countdown timer in there for urgency. So on your tripwire page, you will want a countdown timer.

[00:11:21.760] - Dr. Destini Copp
I like to do 15 or 20 minutes there. I have found we have tested other things. We've tested 30. We've tested, you know, even a little bit longer. It's too long.

[00:11:31.440] - Dr. Destini Copp
Fifteen to 20 minutes is the ideal spot there. You're going to have a cart sales funnel builder like ThriveCart. You'll need an email service provider. We use ConvertKit. But there's tons of options out there for you. And depending on how you set up your evergreen sales funnel, you may need some type of webinar platform or scheduling system,

[00:11:54.020] - Dr. Destini Copp
so if you have a place for them to set up, you know, time with you or book with you, or if you're promoting a higher priced course. So let's say you're promoting like a course that's $1,000 you're going to need a webinar down -- further down that funnel. Not right away, not in what I showed you in the slide -- in the slide, but previously. You're going to need some type of extra convincing, right. They're going to need more information before they invest, you know, 500 or $1,000.

[00:12:28.160] - Dr. Destini Copp
Okay? So let me kind of walk you through this example. So here's another example. So let's say that you are in the blogging niche where you are doing like meal plans, groceries, that sort of thing. You're in the healthy eating, that sort of thing.

[00:12:46.550] - Dr. Destini Copp
Your free gift here could be like an ebook with recipes moving on to the tripwire, which could be Create the Perfect Meal Course. So that's your tripwire and then from there let's say you're going to the checkout. The checkout is in ThriveCart. Remember?

[00:13:01.290] - Dr. Destini Copp
From there they would check out for the Create the Perfect Meal course, but you would have an order bump with some recipe cards. So you kind of see how that complements your Create the Perfect Meal course. So maybe the create the perfect meal course is $27. Maybe your recipe cards are like $7 or whatever.

[00:13:19.100] - Dr. Destini Copp
And then from there you could do some cross sells. You can do a course on traditional food elimination diet. You could do another cross sell on grocery items checklist or something. There's a lot of options that you can do there. Again, the point is you are getting an instant customer. Right?

[00:13:38.730] - Dr. Destini Copp
You're getting an instant customer. You're giving them easy way and easy yes to do business with you. And you can go on outside of this maybe a week or two down the road if you sell any consultations or if you even have higher price courses or whatever, you can add other things to this funnel. So let's talk about some other offers you can promote in a funnel like this, right. There's tons and tons of -- there tons and tons of options here.

[00:14:12.050] - Dr. Destini Copp
So let's say you are a nutrition coach or, you know, as part of your blog, you're getting into nutrition coaching you could do that. You could do a meal planning subscription. So in that funnel, let's say you have a membership where you do meal planning, perfect. You could do online courses. You could do workshops. You could do health and wellness webinars.

[00:14:35.890] - Dr. Destini Copp
You can even promote affiliate products through that funnel doesn't have to be right away, right. It could be in some of the follow up sequences. So dietary supplements and products, health tracking tools, any of those, any of those affiliate products you can promote in there just to keep them interested. You're providing them value, right?

[00:14:56.820] - Dr. Destini Copp
You could do an email, maybe even have a blog post out there that has really good information about a dietary supplement that you've already done. You could take that content repurpose it in an email put your affiliate links in there and there you go. You could do -- of course, you could do low-cost digital products like cookbooks and recipe guides. You could do a community membership, so maybe you have some type of community where people pay maybe $5 or $9 a month to be a part of. You could do a personalized nutrition assessment.

[00:15:30.560] - Dr. Destini Copp
So tons and tons of opportunities for something like that. Now, the next thing I will really want to touch upon which I think is very important in these automated sales funnels, is number one, being ethical but also adding your personal touch and I'm going to talk about how you can do that. Now, the first thing is you need to be very upfront and clear about what you're selling, right. You got to include information on the tripwire page, on the sales page there, right.

[00:15:59.490] - Dr. Destini Copp
They don't have a lot of time to make decision, but you want to be very upfront and clear. This is what you're going to be getting. If you have a refund policy, here's what it is. All of the legal disclaimers make sure that people know what they're actually signing up for. And then let's say that you have in that funnel somewhere down the line maybe you're selling a higher price course and you have a webinar in there. Maybe you have a chat feature in there where there are webinars that you can set up, that even though it's a recorded webinar, you can have a chat feature in there

[00:16:38.270] - Dr. Destini Copp
so if somebody is watching that recorded webinar, they can type in their question to you. It can go to your email and you can respond. So I have set up webinars like this in the past and people have gone through and watched them. They knew it was recorded, right, because I was very transparent.

[00:16:53.960] - Dr. Destini Copp
This is not a live webinar. They knew it was recorded. They typed in their question. It came to my email. I think one was like 9:30 at night.

[00:17:00.790] - Dr. Destini Copp
I responded back to her, she's like, wow, I didn't think I was going to get any response to that whatsoever. But you're just adding that personal touch. So you can do that even in these automated sales funnels. Now, I just touched upon it. You definitely got to be transparent.

[00:17:17.350] - Dr. Destini Copp
So I absolutely cannot stand it when I know that I am going through a recorded webinar and I know when that's happening because I'm savvy enough, right? I've been in this marketing world for a long time and the person who's doing the webinar is pretending like it's live. That just drives me crazy. That is unethical.

[00:17:35.150] - Dr. Destini Copp
Do not do that. And the other thing is, is I definitely would encourage you to use urgency, but don't be pushy. We're not here to pressure people, right, but you can definitely use urgency, and this is extremely ethical, definitely use urgency in these sales funnels. And here's another example of how you can do that.

[00:17:58.460] - Dr. Destini Copp
Now, I mentioned on the tripwire page generally you'll want to do 15 to 20 minutes. Let's say that somebody comes back and they want to purchase they can't you can still set it up so they can purchase, but it can just be at a different price. So maybe the trip wire offer was $27. Maybe the next price -- the next level is 37 or 47 or whatever the case may be. They can still purchase, but they don't get that special deal, right.

[00:18:30.820] - Dr. Destini Copp
The other option is, let's say that you have down the road in that sales funnel, you're selling a higher price course you still want to put a deadline on there because if you don't put that deadline, people won't make a decision. That is a proven fact in marketing. There's been a ton of research on it. So you still can have a deadline, but if somebody purchases within that deadline, you could give them some extra bonuses.

[00:18:57.280] - Dr. Destini Copp
That's an option, right? You can still, you know, give them a reduced price and if they come back to purchase later, they can get a higher price. But there's a lot of things that you can do to incent them and to reward the fast action takers, right. So incent them to make that decision quickly. Now, I want to talk about traffic strategies to get eyeballs on your funnel.

[00:19:21.850] - Dr. Destini Copp
And quite frankly, this is one of the most important things that you'll want to think about because what happens to a lot of folks is they set up this wonderful funnel, but nobody ever sees it. And then they think, what did I do wrong? Well, you didn't do anything wrong. The fact is nobody knows that it even exists. So, if you set one of these automated sales funnels up, you have to, you have to, and I cannot stress this enough, you have to make sure you're driving traffic to it.

[00:19:49.610] - Dr. Destini Copp
Obviously, you guys are bloggers you can drive traffic through your blog to it if you want to be a guest on a podcast, or maybe you want to start your own podcast. Pinterest is also a great way to drive traffic, organic search traffic to your funnels, free PR. So thinking about -- the other thing I love about free PR, not only does it drive traffic, it drives authority or builds authority because when people are listening to you on somebody else's podcast, they're looking up to you as an expert. So you could do guest podcasting. You can do speaking opportunities. You can do guest blogging. I know that a lot of you have probably already dipped your toes in that.

[00:20:32.170] - Dr. Destini Copp
That's a really great way to drive traffic to a free gift that you have. You can do quotes for high authority sites. I have a ton of media examples on my website if you want to go check that out, things that I've done over the years. The other thing, and this is one of my favorite ways to drive traffic, is through collaborations and affiliates so you can participate in a bundle.

[00:20:56.990] - Dr. Destini Copp
That's a great way to drive traffic to your free gifts thereafter your funnels, right? You could be a speaker at a virtual summit another great way to drive traffic. You can do joint Instagram and Facebook lives with somebody's -- and you can also drive traffic to your website and your gifts through other sources like Etsy, AppSumo, Amazon, those are ways I know. I've gone to purchase stuff on Etsy, gone to somebody's website, and entered their world from there.

[00:21:31.710] - Dr. Destini Copp
Now, once you get your sales funnel set up, I want you to go through it just like a new subscriber. You want to make sure that everything is working properly so go through all of your links. Go through all of your emails. Just make sure it's working perfectly. Have your friends go through it. Have your mother go through it.

[00:21:53.120] - Dr. Destini Copp
So have everybody, everybody go through it, test it out, make sure that it's working. And the other thing is you don't want to set it and forget it. So, you're going to want to monitor the data I would say at least on a monthly basis and tweak as necessary. So you'll want to look at things like your landing page. What's your conversion rate there?

[00:22:14.170] - Dr. Destini Copp
I like to see anywhere from like 45% up to 65%. That's generally what we see on our landing pages. A lot of it depends on the traffic, right, that's being driven to it and how aligned they are with the offer and what you have for your free gift. But that's one of the things you want to look at. You want to look at people who are actually seeing your tripwire offer, and how well is that converting.

[00:22:41.070] - Dr. Destini Copp
So that's going to convert anywhere from like five to maybe ten. If you got above that, you're doing extremely, extremely well. So you want to definitely look at it, monitor the data on a monthly basis and tweak as necessary. Now, I do have a free gift for you. This is a free planner for Plan Your Profitable Evergreen Sales Funnel so you can sell your digital products and programs on autopilot.
