Hello, everybody. Welcome, welcome, welcome. I'm so happy and excited that you are joining me on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Thank you so much for your time. I'm going to try to make the next 30 minutes as valuable as possible for you.

[00:00:26.320] - Aisha
Today, I'm going to teach you how to earn $1,000 with 1,000 followers. My name is Aisha Preece. Who am I? Let me just click on that. Okay, so as a bit of quick background, I set up my blog in 2017 and like most people, I had no idea what I was doing and it didn't make any money or any real money. Over time, as we all do, we make our mistakes. But I used to think digital products was a really advanced, really complicated thing to earn from, which really felt out of reach for me. I only dabbled in it two years ago. My first product, I remember thinking, It's too good to be true. I have to be a graphic designer. I'm not creative. I thought I need to be creative. I need to have lots of money and time. It's a complicated setup. Honestly, they're limiting beliefs. This is what I really thought about my digital products when I began as a newbie blogger. But eventually, I managed to try it. And I launched my first digital product on social media, and it was an e-book, and it made me $6,000. And I had definitely less than a thousand followers, because for me, I prefer to have quality over quantity. I don't pay my bills with number of followers. So for me, I'd rather have less followers, but they're engaged. And back in turn... In 2022, I was a newbie. Nobody knew me. Nobody knows me still. But the point is I made $6,000, and that for me was life-changing money. It was proof that people would spend their hard-earned money on my products. And then I decided to test and try. And as my blog business grew and I had more blogs, I set up digital products for the different blogs I own, and I've earned way over $100,000 from digital products. I really, really think digital products is a real tool to financial freedom because you make it once and you can sell it millions of times. It's very... Almost cost of nothing to create and set up, and it can help a lot of people. I think for me, when they talk about passive income, when I'm traveling with my family, when I'm going around the world, when I'm hanging out with my cat, you might see a cat tail in a moment, I can still earn, and I'm still earning digital products. When I'm recording this, I'll check my email and there'll be somebody who has bought digital product of mine, and that's such a privilege. And this is an untapped market because a lot of people think digital products are complicated, like I did. They think it's too difficult. I don't know what to create. I don't know how to sell it. No one's going to buy it. All these things, I used to think. And so I'm here to teach you the exact things I did and do to make money and sell digital products if you have a low number of followers. It could be Twitter, it could be Instagram, it could be anywhere you are on your platform, you can sell digital products and make money with less than 1,000 followers. I know this because I've done it and my students have done it too. Let me just reassure you that if you're sitting there thinking, "Man, I only have 300 followers," you can make money from these digital products.

[00:03:52.900] - Aisha
Moving on. Before we begin, I know that we have our phones with us, and I have my phone on me, and it's basically tracking how long, so I don't go over time limit. But can you just literally for the next 25 minutes, put your phone away, give yourself that privilege, because so often we're being pulled in all these different directions. Let's gift ourselves 30 minutes to learn and let your brain focus. I asked you that. Give yourself that privilege. You get the gift of not being pulled in other directions for the next 25 minutes. Let's try that, okay?

[00:04:27.160] - Aisha
Now, today what you're going to learn is what an earth do you create? What digital products should you create? Because for me, that was my biggest barrier. I was like, I don't know what to create. What do I make? Who wants to buy my digital product? What should I make? And especially at the beginning, when you have not many followers. Number two is what to price it because I often felt like I don't want to overprice it, then no one buys it, then I don't want to underprice it, then it's not valuable and no one buys it anyway. So what do you price it? I'm going to show you exactly what I price my digital products, especially at the beginning. And then how to offer and position your digital product so people buy it. I'm very grateful and privileged that every time I launch a digital product, it sells. It's such a nice feeling because I used to have this fear that I'd launch and there was crickets. I've developed some strategies and really useful ticks, tips, not ticks, tips that I use whenever I'm selling digital products, which really help me and sell my digital products. It's worth my time investment to create the digital product.

[00:05:37.630] - Aisha
Let us begin. First of all, you might be thinking, Well, how does this work? How am I going to make that thousand dollars? I'm very practical. I'd like somebody to remove the fluff and just tell me what to do. When we talk about that amount, that big amount of a thousand dollars, when I break it down, it really helps me. You could sell a $9 product to 100 people. So if you have 300 followers, you could sell it to the 100 of those. $17 product to 59 people and $49 product to 21 people. And so you will realize you don't need that many followers. You just need engaged followers that care about what you're talking about. And how do you do that? I'll teach you in a moment, okay?

[00:06:21.800] - Aisha
So for me, sometimes when I'm thinking, Okay, do I feel it's easier for me to create a $9 product and sell it to 100? Or is it easier for me to sell $49 and 20? You might test these different ones, and I tested all three. But my question is, and really helps me overcome this limiting belief that nobody's going to buy it, is what would you spend? What would you spend? What do you spend on? Also, we think nothing on buying dinner, spending dinner, buying coffee, and spending money every day on things which cost way more than $9, $17, and $49 but are way less valuable. You buy digital products, a good one. It can really like... I've had $17 products that have added dollars to my bottom line. They're so valuable. And so first of all, what would you spend that will help you. What would you expect for $9, $17, $49? Because sometimes we might get into this trap of thinking you have to throw the kitchen sink and give everything, but actually it's $9. It could be a drink for somebody. So we give quick solutions in that $9.

[00:07:29.580] - Aisha
If we look here, I've got a tip for you, right? Start small. If it's your first time creating a digital product and if you have a small audience, don't invest... Personally, and people might disagree with me, but I prefer to start small and test because what happens is I've seen some people, they spend all this energy and time creating a huge course, and then it doesn't sell, they get demotivated, they give up. I think let's create a small product, lower the price, let's get some feedback. If it doesn't work, you haven't spent too much time and money and effort in it. But it allows you to be more flexible. And so things like for those prices between $9 to $49, you can create a planner, an e-book, a workshop, or a mini course. And all of these are created. So I've had a planner, sold it for $9. Workshop, $49. E-book, $17 to $49. Mini course, $49. You can have $37, $49. And so by starting small, it takes the pressure off, and you don't need to... You can just create little bite-sized products which you can test and allow you to get feedback from your customers. Let's look at the time. How are we doing? How am I doing? Good time. I'm not going over the time. Okay, good.

[00:08:48.680] - Aisha
Now, so we know how you're going to do it. You know what kind of product. And also... What was the previous one? Give me a second. Yeah, "How"? We know "What kind of product." Now, number one, tip number one, okay? Most importantly, when you are on your platform, whether it's Instagram, whether it's Twitter, I don't know, whatever it is, it's so important that you are creating content relating to your digital product. If you haven't created it yet, think about what you're going to create. Decide on it. "Okay, I want to create an e-book." Great. In your head, that e-book solves a problem, right? You need to make sure that the content you're putting out is related to the digital product. We want a focused audience. If you have 300 followers, we want those 300 followers to be in your niche, interested in the topic that you're going to sell. I really recommend talking about the pain points and the problems that people in your niche face and solutions. I don't think you should just reserve solutions to a digital product because you need to show people that you are of value, you can provide and you can teach and you have tips and you do that for free in your Instagram or Twitter or a social media platform.

[00:10:09.410] - Aisha
For exampleâ€”I'm very practical, I hate when people say try this theory, theory, but what about practically? For example, imagine you are in the parenting niche. Let's just say you have a mini course on how to help your baby sleep. Really? That would be amazing. I've been babysitting my nephew the last couple of weeks, and wow, I need a course like that. Maybe a little mini course on some hacks to get your baby more settled and you want to sleep. That's going to be a paid product, right? In your free content, think about the problems that parents are facing relating to that. You could maybe give a tip. How to know if your baby has a tummy ache? How to know if your baby is cold? How to know some tips to help your baby's tummy get settled? How I get my baby in a routine? These are all questions I have because I've just babysat my nephew and he's a baby, and I don't have kids. These are questions I'm asking as a newbie, right? Then it is travel. I have a couple of travel blogs. If you're a digital product could be how to travel solo safely, you could talk about in your free content, countries that are safest for solo female travelers, gadgets that you use, places that are dangerous for solo female travelers, things you wish you knew.

[00:11:31.050] - Aisha
The problems that your audience are facing and solutions are all in your free content. Then you can package... Now don't be afraid to package some of the tips and put them into your paid product. Obviously, you're going to have more tips that are more in-depth. But people, not everybody has seen your social media, all the content. I really think that giving free content and giving value is really good, and you can use some of those tips in your paid product anyway. Another example, journaling. I think journaling is fantastic. What are the problems people face when they need journaling? How to overcome overwhelm? What to do if you're feeling demotivated? What if you're sad? How do you keep your thoughts organized? These are all problems. Then you mentioned solutions and journaling is a really good solution. Finally, another example, crafts. I know, for example, in crochet and knitting, they have these patterns. They have these digital product patterns you could print and they sell them. It's amazing. You can share different challenges that you face, like how do you know what pattern, which to follow? You can also actually share some of your patterns and share how you managed to do it in this amount of time and how much easier it was because you now have guidance.

[00:12:47.240] - Aisha
And so talk about the pain point, mention the solution and create content relating to the digital product. And I promise you, you will get targeted audience that will buy your products, okay? Because we live in a big world with people with different interests. But we want to speak to the people and connect with the people in our niche by solving the problems that people are facing in your niche, okay? That's how you build a relationship. Now, number two, this is so important because you could talk till you're blue in the face all day long about how amazing your product is, but people want to see proof. Like I said, I'm very black and white. Show me proof that your product works. And also how it affects your life before and after positively. For example, if you're in a parenting niche, and you're selling a mini course on helping the baby sleep, if you don't want to show your kid's face, you could blur out the face, or you could just have your baby there and show your baby sleeping. Show you having a bubble bath because you now have time in the evening because your baby's sleeping.

[00:13:51.670] - Aisha
Talk about how you feel now that you know how to put your baby to sleep. For me, when I was babysitting my nephew, I felt sheer panic every day. I was like, How do I make this creature sleep? This beautiful creature that opens its eyes in the morning and smiles, becomes a little monster and screams. I have no idea what to do with it. If the mother's not there, mother had to go to the doctor or whatever. For me, if I had a solution to say, "Listen, reduce your panic, reduce your overwhelm that you know how to help the baby sleep," Wow! You know what? After this, I'm going to google digital product "how to help the baby sleep." And I don't even have a baby. Travel, for example. Let's say you have a solo female travel. You want to help solo travelers travel more. Talk about how confident you feel now, how happy and inspired you feel that you can travel alone, that you don't have to wait for people, share your life and share proof of your life now that you have your product. Similar with a food blog, often food bloggers have recipes. You can share actual delicious food, share pictures of your family enjoying your food, share that, to be honest, if you have a food blog, any of your recipe, just show your food. Honestly, that's proof enough, right? But I'm sure there are challenges when you don't have a recipe book, you don't know what to order like you talk about don't know what to order in the groceries, spending a lot of money on groceries because you don't have a guided recipe book to help you cook delicious food, nutritious food.

[00:15:22.550] - Aisha
Number two is share your own proof. This is really interesting because I'm in many niches. Excuse me, there's something in my eyelash. I don't know what it is. It's like dust. This, for example, for me, I have blogs in the travel niche, I have blogs in other niches, but I'm also in the blogging niche. I teach blogging. This is a bit awkward for me because it feels obnoxious to share income screenshots. But if you follow my Instagram, quite often I will share proof of what I earn. I'll share my income, my digital product revenue. I'll share my affiliate revenue. I'll share my ad revenue. I will share screenshots. I'll blur out any sensitive information. Because for me, anybody can say, I earn money blogging. Anybody can say I earn money from digital products affiliate. Show me the proof. My audience know, and I have a really tiny but mighty Instagram community, they know when I say something, I have proof. I back it up with the receipt. They will see screenshots of all the things that I talk about. It builds credibility. It's so important that you do that.

[00:16:23.030] - Aisha
Now, number three, don't be afraid to share the bad. This is something a lot of people feel embarrassed about because it means, "Oh, I'm not an expert if I share the bad," but we are all humans. You can be an expert and still share the bad. You share the journey. When you share the bad, people will believe you when you share the good. For example, let's say if you're in a parenting blog, you can share a video of the baby screaming its head off, or you're looking really tired because you're like, do you know, some days you really could try everything in the guide and mini course? Babies are babies. They're going to cry. That's how it is, right? Or if you have a food blog, sometimes you might burn something. I think I felt quite overwhelmed the other day, and I just burnt my... You know what? I tried to make chicken satay with peanut sauce, and I had great, great notions of becoming the next master chef, and that baby burnt. I burnt the chicken. It was black and I was so embarrassed. You've got to share real situations. Life is not perfect. For me, I'll share the journey. When I'm sharing about my blogging journey, when we've had Google updates, ups and downs, when you get troll comments, when some days you wake up and you just don't want to work, stuff like that. Share it. Share the good and the bad. It's okay. People will relate to you and they will appreciate that you're human too. You're not perfect. Number three is don't be afraid sometimes to share the bad and share it. It's fine.

[00:17:47.240] - Aisha
Number four... How are we doing for time, folks? Let me just check. Okay, good. We're doing good. Number four is give access for free to some people in your community and get a genuine testimonial. Because when you're at the beginning, you don't have anybody who's taking your course. It's only you who's vouched for your course. But there's no better vouch. There's no better proof than real people who say, "You know what? I took this course and it changed my life." Showing proof from others builds credibility and authority. At the beginning, you thinking your product is awesome, people are going to think you're biased, which you are, because hopefully you created the best product you could. You need proof that other people think the same. I have friends in my community that are all really loyal students. I just tap them on the shoulder virtually and say, Hey, do you want to take my course? I genuinely need feedback. If you think it's rubbish, tell me. I'd love to know. But if it's good, if I give you this course, can I get a testimonial? And all 10 out of 10 times people will say yes. Give them access for free, get a testimonial, and get genuine testimonials. What you need to share is how it changed before and after. A generic, Oh, this course is great, or This plan is great, is to be honest, great. But really helpful if they give tangible feedback like this, like my SEO course, people say, "My traffic increased from zero to 20,000 as a newbie." That's real proof, and they share screenshots of proof. Or they say, Affiliate marketing. I made my first $100 affiliate sale. Or they say, "I feel less overwhelmed if you're a parent. I feel less overwhelmed. My life is so much more organized now." Share the before and after. Share tangible things that people can relate to when they're giving tests. Tell them, if you give me testimonials, can you tell me how it affected your life? How did it improve your life? That's number four. That's something I do when I'm selling my digital products. I definitely get some testimonials before I then sell it to the rest of my audience. So start with that. Now, I'm going to actually share a step-by-step plan at the end. If you're thinking or writing this down, what do I do first? Just take a moment, listen and learn. At the end, I'm going to share a step-by-step plan, okay?

[00:20:10.590] - Aisha
Another tip, and not many people talk about this, and I think they should, is sharing your values and your care for your students. Because values bind and unite similar people. People are more likely to buy and connect and relate to people who have the same values. People buy from people they like and trust. Don't be afraid to share your values. My values, and my students know this, is freedom. Freedom is so important to me. As a woman, I grew up in an Asian culture with a lot of conservative beliefs and whatnot background. To me, female empowerment and freedom is so important. Having the financial independence to make your own decisions is very important to me. To me, having said that, freedom not also of financial independence, but freedom of choices. My community knows that my whole motto is, "How can I work less and earn more so I can do the things I love with people I love?" That is literally my life motto. How can I work less and earn more so I can do the things I love with  people I love? When I make decisions in the way I teach and everything I do for my community, I think I want you to have more time, more money so you can do the things you love with people you love, and that value permeates throughout my whole business. People who relate to that value, they listen to me, they buy from me. There are people who perhaps they don't want to have that word of mouth, but they want to hustle hard.

[00:21:43.920] - Aisha
They have these bros out there like, "Hustle hard, 24-7, work, work, work." No, that's fine. They'll join another community. My community is about we work, but we also have good life balance. We eat good food, we exercise, we spend time with family. How do we have that balance? Share your values. People will relate to you. You know what's important to you. You know what you love, you think, mention it. Mention your values. Also, don't be afraid to share how much you care about your students. People forget to mention this, but you know your offering. You know your customer support with your students. How well you support and care for your students will determine whether they buy the next product. I have to say, my recurrence rate is that if they buy the first product, they buy the next five. That's my recurrence rate with my students because they know, number one, that my digital product will overdeliver for the price. Number two, I'll take care of them, send them voice notes, ask them how they are, how's their mom, and you can share that and really share your love for your students because people think, "Well, that's weird. Why should I share it?" Share it because you care about your students. Let them know that you care for them. People need to care for each other. I do this, and if you follow my Instagram, you'll see, in the stories, especially, I will just sometimes randomly message my students like, "Hey, how's it going? I heard you had a bad day the other day. Is everything okay?" And so share that you care for your students and let others know that if they join your community, they will be cared for also, okay?

[00:23:15.770] - Aisha
Now, number six, discounts are great because, number one, it gives people the opportunity to try with less risk. If it's a price that they're not comfortable with, it feels risky. They're like, "Is it worth my time? With my money?" But if you give them a deep discount and it's a limited time discount, they can test and try your product with less risk, number one. Number two is human nature, we need urgency. I will procrastinate till the cows come home if you give me the opportunity. But if someone tells me, Listen, Black Friday is ending on Monday. You need to get 40% off, if not you'll pay the full price.

[00:23:49.760] - Aisha
I'm more likely to reach into my pocket. I need that push. And so give a limited time discount. Give a coupon code to your Instagram community and say, "It expires in, I don't know, three days" or "Expires at midnight." Give a limited time discount. Honestly, it really makes a difference if you really want to... Some people need encouragement. If you really believe your product's good, then I don't see an issue with giving them a bit of encouragement so they can actually get to use your product and benefit from it. Now, finally, let me check the time. Oh, we're doing it. We're going to keep going.

[00:24:25.460] - Aisha
Now, final tip. I always mention this, and I think it's so important because, yes, we are in this business to make money. We need to pay our bills. But I also think that we're in this for the long run. We're not here for just a quick one-off sale. We're in this business and we want it to sustain us in the long run. I don't believe that you should sell if it's not right for them because they'll just disappear and bad-mouth you, and then you have an angry customer.

[00:24:53.150] - Aisha
I say honestly, listen, I genuinely believe this product will help solve this problem. It will help you. It will make a difference to your life. But if you are in severe financial difficulty, I don't think you should buy it. The amount of times I have students, I rejected and said, "No, I cannot take you on as a student because I think right now your priorities are to pay off your debt." I want to make sure that I take into account I'm not taking advantage of them. If they show to me that they can afford it, that they've got a plan, great, we can talk. Another thing is if you genuinely don't think it would help them, let's say, for example, let's just say I approach somebody and I say, "I want to know how to help a baby sleep," but then I don't plan to have a baby and I'm never going to see my nephew again. If I say that, and I'm just like, "Oh, do you think I need it?" And they're like, "Yeah, I think you need it." "I don't need it because I'm never going to be around a baby again.

[00:25:45.230] - Aisha
Let's just say I say that, right? So don't push something if they genuinely don't need it. If, let's say, for example, someone's a new blogger and there's a really expensive tool, if you don't think they need it, don't push it. They're going to come to you later on. Honestly, trust and referrals brings you a lot of income, goodwill. Think long term. Don't be afraid to disclaim it. If you genuinely don't think someone should buy it, say don't buy this if X, Y, and Z, and not those fake if you don't want to take action. "If", those are fake "ifs," right? These are genuine "ifs." If you are in severe financial difficulty, I think you should focus on those for now. This product maybe you can get next time. For me, if it's genuinely not good for my student, then I won't sell it to them. They say to me, "Oh, I don't ever plan to travel solo and I don't actually enjoy traveling solo. Do you think I should get this solo travel kit?" Well, no, because if you don't plan to travel solo, then if you're curious, get it. But if you don't ever plan to travel solo, then maybe you don't need it. For me, don't be afraid to say no, because you will get way more sales when you are genuinely recommending something later on, which is going to help them. Those are the seven things that I recommend that I do and I implement to sell digital product when I had a thousand followers, less than a thousand followers.

[00:27:08.120] - Aisha
Now, let's talk about steps because I'm very practical. I need someone to say, "Oh, okay, now what?" You're sitting here right now, you have less than a thousand followers. What do you do? Step one, forget everything else. Let's not complicate everything else. Step one, decide on a product. Is it a planner? Is it a mini course? Pick a small product less than 50 bucks. Decide on it. Allocate time, create it. Figure out what problem it's solving and create that product. You've got that product. Great. Now it's time for you to go back to your social platform or whatever platform you're on. Start brainstorming problems that your audience are facing. What are the problems they are facing in that niche? If you really struggle, go to ChatGPT. I'm sure ChatGPT can answer. Sit down, google it, find out what are the issues people are facing?

[00:27:57.570] - Aisha
Write down on the list. Start creating Reels, Twitter, content that solves... Mention the problem, mention the solution. Mention the problem, mention the solution. Number three, you say you've done that, great. It's next step. Start sharing proof of how your digital product is working for you and how it affects your life positively. Share a picture of you living your best life. That's okay. How different things are less anxiety, less panic, how you feel more confident. Share before and after. If it's blogging, share the income you're earning. Number four, once you've done that, approach a few people in your community and offer maybe three, maximum three, and offer your product for free in exchange for a really solid testimonial, sharing how it changed their lives to how it improved their lives. Get that screenshot and you can add it to your sales page. Or if you don't have a sales page, you can share it on your Instagram anyway, right? Then what you do after that is I would share your values. In your content, start sharing your values. What's important to you? Why is solo travel important to you? Why do you think that you want your baby to have a routine and sleep?

[00:29:07.030] - Aisha
Why? Because you need your sanity, you want your baby to be calm. You want to have organization in your life. You want it to be a mom that's it. That's it. That's trying to help organize your life and have balance, right? So share your values, because some mums that may not be important to them, if you're in the parenting niche. Now, number six I want to do after that is offer a limited time discount. So mention that here's a coupon code, or if you get it from this time to this time, launch price, you get it 40% or 50% or 20% or whatever. Give a limited time discount and honor it. Honor that. If you say you're going to raise the price, raise the price. Because it's not fair for people that have bought it when it's a discount, and maybe they had to borrow money or whatever. Make sure that you honor that if you say that the price is going to go up. Finally, give it honest disclaimer. If you don't think it's good, don't buy this if, it's not for you. Just be very honest and turn away money if it's not good for the customer.

I'm okay with that because money will come back later. If you take these steps, even with less than a thousand followers, I'm very confident that you can make money from your digital product. I know this because I've done it and my students have too. Now, I know a big objection. I hope you found those useful. First of all, I hope you found those tips useful. Now, a big, big, big barrier that I faced when I started selling digital products was, there's so many other people selling the same thing. How do I stand out? I don't know how to differentiate my product. How do I create something that's useful and helpful that everyone else hasn't done? I'm going to create a digital product training, actually, specially for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm going to record this record video training for you after this. It's called, very simply, How to overcome competition when selling a digital product. I really don't have an issue with competition. I'm in a really competitive niche. But there are things that I do and there's strategies I follow and there's things that I know that have really helped me not even worry about competition.

I don't need to worry about competition, and there's a reason why. What you can do is you can click... Let me think here. This is training to access the freebie. This is free, only for Blogger Breakthrough Summit, right? You're going to need to go on the right side here, right? This is a mock-up, it's not mine. On the bottom of your page, on the right, you're going to see this thing on the right. That is where the freebie is going to be. You click on that and you will get access to that training. Okay, maybe not. Then you get access to this training. Then what you can do is go through the video training and really understand how you can remove that barrier of worrying about competition and having a product, which there's so many people in your niche. I think I'm doing... Yeah, I've done okay for time. I'm really pleased. What I want... Okay, yeah. If you'd love to stay in touch, I'm really active on Instagram. I always reply to my messages. Come and connect with me. Say hi. I say hi back. If you have any genuine issues or challenges with selling digital products, send me a message.

I'm there. I'll voice note back. I'll try and help you. I'm really passionate about this. Follow me on Instagram. Aisha Preece, there. There we go. Also, if you want, you can drop me an email. Maybe you're shy, you don't want to approach me on Instagram, that's fine. Drop me an email. I respond way faster on Instagram, but hey, I'm here to help. I really, really think if you have so much to offer, you're here, you're showing up, you're watching this, and that's half the battle, right? Now you just need to go and just create it and sell it. I'd love to hear, actually, when you do sell it, let me know how you get on, what challenges you have, and let's stay in touch. I wish you lots of luck. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Reach over and pat yourself on the back. You did so well to make it to this part. You should be proud of your self for gifting yourself this time. I wish you lots of luck.
