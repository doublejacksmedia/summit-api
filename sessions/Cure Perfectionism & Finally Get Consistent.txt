[00:00:13.430] - Doreen
Hey. Hi. Hello. Are you someone who procrastinates until the very last second, you're launching a digital product or you're creating a digital product. But the launch date keeps getting pushed back again and again because, you know, you keep on thinking of more things that you can add or pieces that you can rerecord.

[00:00:27.450] - Doreen
Or maybe there's stuff that you want to take out of it, like there's so much things that you could change and make it so much better, right? Never mind actually selling the same. You know, that you have to schedule the Instagram post or the newsletter, whatever it might be, but you're going to hold off until the very last second, like you have a draft there, but it's going to need some tweaking. So, you're just going to hold off and wait.

[00:00:45.100] - Doreen
You're holding off because you know that you're going to want to tweak it before you hit publish, and maybe in the end it never gets published. That happens. So, before I get carried away. Let me introduce myself. I'm Doreen.

[00:00:57.450] - Doreen
I'm the heart and soul behind Knap Creative, and I'm here to be your voice of reason in all the small business and social media sheds. And today, I'm going to give you perfectionism a little kick in the pants. Hopefully that helps, and help you get on the right track with consistency. Okay, so I get it. I wouldn't necessarily call myself a perfectionist, but I definitely would say that I have high standards, and I don't know, is there a difference between those two things.

[00:01:19.820] - Doreen
I don't know. It's debatable. So, right now I'm guessing that you are in the planning phase, right? Like you're here, you are gathering up all the information and doing all the research to make sure that your product is freaking awesome, which, high fives, you should be doing that. That's absolutely what you need to be doing.

[00:01:34.320] - Doreen
But here's the thing. You don't want to get stuck in that spot, and that is way too easy to do. 100%. I've done that. It's very fun to plan things.

[00:01:43.240] - Doreen
It's a lot less fun and a lot more scary to actually put them out into the world. Right? I totally get it if you're anything like me you know, free summit. Yes. Sign me up. 100%.

[00:01:53.280] - Doreen
You're here. Podcast out the wizard. Your secret Pinterest is seeing a lot of action. You've got mountains of notebooks. You're pushing your kids because you're trying to think and you're scoping out how everybody else is doing it, picking up what you can, spinning your own magic into it and trying to make it the best that it could possibly, possibly ever be.

[00:02:10.250] - Doreen
Right. I know the trail. I also know that once you dig in and you start planning, which is very fun. You're also going to start getting targeted with ads from other people who are trying to do the same thing as you. Right.

[00:02:21.380] - Doreen
And chances are, if they're running ads. These are people that have been doing it for you know a lot longer than you have if they're doing it right? Absolutely. It means that they've been doing it longer than you have. So, yeah.

[00:02:31.720] - Doreen
Sometimes their stuff is pretty awesome, and sometimes that can get you in a head space. That is not that fun, and it's not helpful for someone who already has high standards. That's what going to call perfection, because it's way nicer.

[00:02:44.790] - Doreen
But let's take a step back and just think about this for a second. So, this is a question that I ask myself all the time. How ridiculous is it that you are trying to make a thing that is better than all of the other things combined on your first try? That's pretty stinking ridiculous. Right.

[00:03:01.510] - Doreen
Between where you are now and where you want to be, there is a mountain of imperfect work absolutely. The people that you're looking at, the people that are running those ads, the people whose stuff that you're poking around and looking through. Those people didn't get there in one single giant lead, like they didn't start at the bottom and be like, okay now and then end up, you know, this, logically, you know this, right?

[00:03:19.540] - Doreen
They started exactly where you are, like, zero followers, $0.00 sales. Zero. Of all the things, I just went back and I looked at my goals from 2019, which was fine. By the way, if you have time to do this, do it for sure. Keep track of your goals and keep it in a file so that you can always look back because it's really fun to see that's a good way to see progress, because sometimes it can be hard to see the progress.

[00:03:41.330] - Doreen
But I looked at my goals. Making a consistent $5,000 a month was a stretch goal where I was like, I want to be making that every month, and it was really just like I couldn't really wrap my brain. I was trying to figure out a way to make it happen, and it was difficult. So, at that time, I was launching a program called Thrive that was my first attempt at kind of like a mentorship/course. That was my first digital product, honestly, and it wasn't terrible.

[00:04:07.170] - Doreen
I feel good about what I did at the time. I sold a few, I ran through. It was fine. It wasn't terrible. But also if I did it now, it would be so different.

[00:04:16.180] - Doreen
And it would be so much better. Because I did the first sucky round, like, I wouldn't be here today because without having done the crappy first round and I'm not going to get to where I want to be because trust me, I have not even come remotely close to making it yet by not doing the middle stuff, right. It's a journey for sure. So, I did the first sucky round. Now I'm doing less sucky rounds and there's always room for improvement, right? Always, always, always, and then just keep showing up.

[00:04:47.300] - Doreen
So, do the first one. Keep showing up, keep showing up. Doing the thing is what makes you get really good at the thing. That's the only way. What did they say?

[00:04:55.500] - Doreen
I read this summit recently and it was so true. You can't learn how to swim by reading a brochure about swimming, like you can learn the motions or whatever. But until you actually get in the water, you're not going to know how to swim. So, same with everything that you're trying to do in your digital products and in your business, like you have to be doing the thing in order to learn how to do the thing. And it's messy.

[00:05:14.830] - Doreen
It's really uncomfortable. But with that being said, get busy. If you do one thing, if you take one thing away from this whole training, set yourself some deadlines, make yourself accountable and commit to it. Like putting it out there, whether it's creating your first product or whether it's iterating on that product. Like maybe you've created one and you want to make it better.

[00:05:34.780] - Doreen
Definitely. Set yourself a deadline, make yourself accountable and commit to it. Or even if it's, like you have the product, that part is done and you want to show up on social media to sell that product, same thing. Set a deadline, commit to it and make yourself accountable. Just make it happen. Here's a spoiler for you.

[00:05:52.170] - Doreen
Even if you spend 1000 years at an awesome summit like this one, your stuff is not going to be perfect. And even if you spend 1000 years making that product, it's still not going to be perfect. I know that you know this, but you've got to get the crappy ones out of the way to get to the really good ones, and it's going to be uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable that my camera just did this. I want to start this over.

[00:06:09.620] - Doreen
Am I going to do it? No, this hopefully is useful, even though it's not perfect. So, yeah, it's really the only way to do that, so.

[00:06:17.830] - Doreen
I know. I hear you if you're saying, oh, you know what? I'm not quite clear on my Perfect Fit client because I know the messaging out there is so noisy around this, you accidentally maybe wore your hair down on one video and then you put it up on another video and you want it to be really consistent across the boards. And I have to refund the whole thing. Or maybe you just ran across a PDF that's, like, so much nicer than anything that you've put out there.

[00:06:38.080] - Doreen
And you're kind of lowkey, like thinking maybe you should rebrand it a little bit like it's not out there. It's not doing. You can still do that, right? No, quit it. Don't do that.

[00:06:47.730] - Doreen
So, you will go on forever. If you're stuck in this spin, you will go on forever. Just put it out. So like I said, it doesn't have to be perfect to be useful. This is far from perfect.

[00:06:57.340] - Doreen
Hopefully it's still useful. This is a quote by Elizabeth Gilbert that always comes to mind when I'm thinking about it. I think I have this in my grid, and I should literally frame it and put it up on my desk. Perfectionism is just fear in fancy shoes and a mink coat. It's true.

[00:07:12.620] - Doreen
Perfectionism is just an excuse for not doing the thing you're getting in your own way. I know it's uncomfortable. I know it sucks. I know it's not like a great feeling, but it's good after. And that's how you're going to get to where you want to go.

[00:07:22.570] - Doreen
So, you have all the information that you need to put something pretty awesome out there. You probably have enough information just like honestly in your own notebook right here. Right? Like you have the information. So that's not what we're short on.

[00:07:34.510] - Doreen
You're here. You're learning the thing, you're getting, the information you're taking it in. Hopefully, you're taking some notes. That's awesome. But you don't need more information.

[00:07:42.610] - Doreen
What you do need is you need to take action. That's the part that's missing, not the information, the action is what's missing. Let's say that you've gotten an iteration or two of your product out of the way and you need to get consistent about actually selling it. Let's tackle that part next.

[00:07:57.180] - Doreen
So, I'm going to address Instagram land. First of all, it's my happy place. I've seen some really good results there, so I feel like I can stick into it absolutely. And second, most of us are hanging out there, right?

[00:08:08.300] - Doreen
Like that's where we're at right now. This stuff applies across the board, though, like if you're in Facebook groups or if you're on LinkedIn or Twitter, whatever your platform is, or if you're watching this in the future and it's a different platform, this stuff still applies across the board. It's just going to look a little bit different depending on the context, but the principles are the same. So, Instagram is noisy here. You have to do reals. You have to do stories you have to post in the grid.

[00:08:32.170] - Doreen
You haven't even thought about lives or guides or any of that stuff, but it really does feel like you're leaving opportunity on the table if you're not using all of the pieces, right? No, you're not. I will say you are not leaving opportunity on the table. It feels like you are. I know the messaging, like I get blasted with the exact same stuff as you do.

[00:08:49.740] - Doreen
It's a lot. It's a lot.

[00:08:52.830] - Doreen
I'm not saying that all of those things aren't awesome because they are. They're all awesome. But here's the thing. You don't learn how to juggle by throwing templates into the air all at once. You're not going to throw them all up and be like, okay, cool.

[00:09:02.580] - Doreen
Let's go. It's not going to end well for you. You want to get a handle on one plate or one layer, and then you want to add another one, right? You're going to take it just a little step at a time. So, Instagram, specifically, the order of importance to the layers that I'm talking about are the plates when it comes to actually selling your product, because I want to talk about selling because you can create the product and you can put it out there and you can build the audience and you can do all the stuff.

[00:09:26.110] - Doreen
But until you're actually getting dollars into your pockets, what are you doing? This is a business. You want to make some money, right. The first stories I want you to do a fair amount of stories. Second of all, the grid, a little bit of the grid, and then third, reels, whatever you can handle sustainably.

[00:09:43.190] - Doreen
And we're going to dig into each of those one at a time and make them really easy to pick up and really doable for everybody. So, first, before we do that, I want to take a step back and I want to talk about, we talked about consistency, right. Consistency is in the title. You pick this up because you want to show consistently. That's the message.

[00:09:58.490] - Doreen
Right? Like you need to show up consistently. And usually that's taken to mean you need to be showing up frequently or often. But consistency does not mean that you have to be there seven days a week. It doesn't mean you have to be there five days a week.

[00:10:11.960] - Doreen
Even consistency is whatever you can handle in this season of life that you're in for an extended period of time. Right. So, maybe that is every day. Maybe right now, you have a lot of bandwidth, you have a lot of time, you have a lot of energy, which I'm so jealous. And that means that you can show up every single day.

[00:10:28.250] - Doreen
Awesome. High fives. Do it. But maybe it means that you can only show up two days a week. What we want to get away from here is showing up frequently for a week, you know five times, you have a week, you're feeling it, you're in the flow. You're creating a ton of content.

[00:10:44.700] - Doreen
You're showing up consistently, and then the next week or the next month, you fall off the faces of the planet. That's what we want to get away from. So anything that you can handle consistently. So, if you're feeling it that week and you want to create a ton of content, create it and just like, schedule it out in advance. So, you're still showing up two or three times a week, but just for more weeks, if that makes any sense.

[00:11:03.370] - Doreen
So, whatever that looks like for you, I want you to sit down. And I'm not telling you to do a lot of homework on this, actually. But one thing that I do want you to do is for stories, the grid and reals. What is that number for you? How many times per week are you committed to showing up on your Instagram or whatever the platform is for you.

[00:11:23.200] - Doreen
Right? Like, if it's not Instagram, for something else, definitely just commit to whatever that looks like for you, the frequency, then the other side of consistency. So, when we think of consistency, it's frequency, but also clarity. Right? Like when someone knows what to expect when they land on your stuff, that's consistent because you're talking about the same thing all the time.

[00:11:41.850] - Doreen
If you don't feel like you're repeating yourself, you're not being consistent enough. And I also know, like I said, the messaging and especially for young business owners. And I say that you can be 100 years old and just starting a new business and that's a young business owner. So, someone who's just kind of newish, the advice that you hear is to find your niche or to niche down and same thing. Like, be clear, talk about the same thing.

[00:12:03.960] - Doreen
But the reality is you're not going to get there by not doing it same thing. You got to take it one step at a time. If you're second guessing that foundational stuff and getting stuck in the plan, that's where you get stuck in the planning phase, right where they're like, oh, you have to niche down. So, you're sitting here stewing about what your niche might be and not doing the actual work, like working is going to get you the niche. If that makes any sense, like, you just have to show up and you just have to do the thing.

[00:12:30.620] - Doreen
And I would say, like, a couple of years, it can take quite a significant amount of time. I know that I can niche down more. I also know that I have a thriving, successful business without niching down as much as people are telling me to niche down because I'm doing something that works for me. So, do what feels really good for you. If you struggle, I'm not going to go too far down the rabbit hole.

[00:12:50.010] - Doreen
Now, I feel like this is a whole other tangent that I want to go on, but I'll try to stay focused. You are your brand. So, if you find yourself having a really hard time, niching down or you're interested in a whole bunch of things, then you are the brand. You have to really brand yourself. So that's like, my quick word of advice on that.

[00:13:04.640] - Doreen
Follow me on social media and talk to me there. If you have any questions about that stuff, because I will no doubt clearly any time. Yeah. So, don't get stuck in the planning phase of this. Like if you don't feel totally sure on some of those foundational things, move ahead anyways.

[00:13:19.030] - Doreen
Do the thing. Anyways, doing the work is going to get you the clarity, right. So that's that side of consistency. Alright. So, let's talk about stories.

[00:13:29.200] - Doreen
That was one of the layers that I wanted to cover. So, stories are my favorite part of Instagram, honestly. They are magic when it comes to selling on Instagram. I would not be standing here where I am today without having showed up on Instagram stories. And I know it feels super dumb to hold up your phone and talk at it.

[00:13:49.470] - Doreen
It feels so dumb. I agree. I still feel dumb to this day. You might have to do a few takes at first, but generally speaking, it's the easiest content to create. It's the quickest and also it's going to get you the most connections and the most sales for sure, so that I know for sure.

[00:14:04.340] - Doreen
I also know you're going to get better at it if you practice. I know that comes as a real surprise. Second of all, it's made me a pretty hefty chunk of money, so I'm going to keep doing it you know, and better than that. I've also made some real sole connections through showing up on Instagram stories, and that's without showing up very vulnerable. I know what the narratives are, where it's like you have to be authentic and all the buzzwords and all the things like I show up in a work capacity.

[00:14:32.670] - Doreen
And still, I have made some really solid awesome connections so you don't have to get super uncomfortable. You draw your own line of what your boundaries are. Again, another conversation for another day. So, here's what you need to do to get consistent with your stories. 

[00:14:48.060] - Doreen
Again, I know that I said this already, but I'm just going to remind you practice makes better and also scheduling right? So, consistency doesn't mean constantly. It's scheduling out something that's going to work for you. So for me right now that looks like taking Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday all off. I don't show up on stories most weeks on those days, but I do show up consistently Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as much as I can.

[00:15:08.630] - Doreen
So that's the first part second part is maybe you do have the time and you can schedule it in and all of that is fine. But you open up your phone to post a story and then you feel like, who cares about my life or what do I even talk about those kind of questions? Totally understandable, 100% been there. So, first thing always always share behind the scenes enthusiasm and frustrations that you're feeling as you're developing your offers. So, whatever your product is as you're creating it.

[00:15:36.040] - Doreen
I know this can feel messy, but share when you're really excited about something and you're working on it behind the scenes and it's feeling so good or when it's not going as well as you want.

[00:15:45.070] - Doreen
People love this stuff. They want to be along for the ride, that's part of the story. So, it happens automatically. You don't have to figure out your story first and then do it. You just document stuff as it's happening and that turns into your story.

[00:15:56.040] - Doreen
So that's the first part. Second, whenever you get a kind word or testimonial or review or anything messages about your product, share that too. Like share it as you go. Those two things alone are going to get dollars into your Jeep. So behind the scenes enthusiasm and frustrations and testimonials social proof, kind words, all that kind of stuff. So, second of all, you got a freebie with this presentation.

[00:16:18.870] - Doreen
Follow those prompts in there. Those story prompts are designed to spark conversations. They are designed to help you build trust with your audience, and they are designed to help you sell stuff. So, myself there, sell stuff. So, if you try that and you do like it, sign up for the toolbox because you will get those prompts right in your Instagram every single day.

[00:16:38.510] - Doreen
And legit. So, many people that are in the toolbox are like, this is my favorite part. That's the best part of the toolbox. So, definitely, if you like it, you can get more of it for sure. So that's it for story.

[00:16:50.840] - Doreen
Then let's talk about the grid. So, I said less on the grid. What did I say to the grid in the beginning? Like, lots of stories and kind of show up on the grid. You don't want to neglect it all together, but also don't stress it.

[00:17:01.540] - Doreen
If you can only do a couple of posts per week, like that's enough. That's all we're doing. If you neglect it, your stats are going to drop off the face of the map. We've also tried that because I love stories, and I'm like, well, this is not enough in reals, right? We're going to address that later, but reals.

[00:17:18.210] - Doreen
So, I'm like, if I just do the video parts, can I just leave the grid? No, it turns out you can't just leave the grid. So, you'll do better if you do post a few posts on the grid per week. And then same thing, if you're not sure what to post before somebody hits follow on your account, they're going to scroll past the first few post to see kind of like what you're all about. Like they're going to check your stories and they're going to look at your bio and they're going to look at your first few posts, so make sure that you're kind of looping content.

[00:17:40.540] - Doreen
That's going to answer the questions that they're going to have going in. Right. So, you want to talk about you. You definitely want to have pictures of your face in there as much as possible. Why you're doing, what you're doing, that kind of stuff, stuff that you value in your business that don't be dry and like, corporate about it.

[00:17:54.280] - Doreen
But talk about it that's important. People need to know with that and they connect with that. Right? That's a small business. That's why people buy from us.

[00:18:02.050] - Doreen
Second, personal insights or encouragement is something that you can do. Giving permission to people to be who they are and where they are right now in the messy middle you know, and encouraging them that they can make it to the other side. They can achieve their goals, whatever it has to be relevant obviously to your product, but personal insights, encouragement works really well too. Helpful content, so this is stuff that people are going to want to save.

[00:18:25.010] - Doreen
Right. So you want to be sharing tutorials or hacks or trainings or things like that. The question that I always ask for this is like, what can someone do today in two minutes or less? That's relevant to my niche, that they can turn around and apply and make their day better tomorrow. So, what's one thing I can do tonight to make my day better tomorrow?

[00:18:43.070] - Doreen
That's what you can put in there. It doesn't have to be rocket science. Don't overthink it like this can be so, so, simple. And honestly, the simpler the better. So, don't make it complicated where it doesn't need to be.

[00:18:54.250] - Doreen
Fourth thing is showcasing your product or service, obviously. And fifth benefits of working with you. Like, what are they going to get out of it? So, people are really, all of this camera, people are really just like what's in it for me, you need to be sharing that stuff in your grid. So, they're going to be scrolling past those first few posts and they're going to be wanting to see all of those things.

[00:19:12.730] - Doreen
So, again, the toolbox has all of this stuff in it and so many more things honestly. So, if you're stuck on writing captions, definitely grab it. The templates in there are so juicy. Honestly, I'll just sit here and brag, but they're better than anything else that I've seen.

[00:19:30.040] - Doreen
So, they will sound just like you, but they're also strategic and not just fluff. Right? Okay. So that's it for the grid. So, we've covered stories.

[00:19:37.740] - Doreen
We've covered the grid. Let's talk about reels.

[00:19:42.270] - Doreen
Oh, reels. I have a love-hate relationship with reals. I'll tell you that right now. So question should you be doing reals? Right? Everybody is asking, should I be doing real?

[00:19:49.930] - Doreen
I don't know. Maybe, it depends. So, first of all, question, do you have a handle on your grid and your stories? If not, don't. You want to reach more people. I mean, if yes, let's carry on to the next question.

[00:20:02.950] - Doreen
I should clarify that. So, do you have a handle on your grid and your stories? If not, don't even worry about this part. If yes, do you want to reach more people?

[00:20:10.570] - Doreen
That is the way that I should have phrased that. So, if yes, then give them a whirl. Definitely worth a try. So, do you have to point and ask and do silly lip dubs? No, you absolutely don't.

[00:20:22.730] - Doreen
I opposite of recommend that, what's the opposite of recommending? Because that's what I do about that. So, please do not hesitate. I'm going to share a link here as well to Sidney Raz is the name of the account, SIDNEY RAZ on Instagram, and he takes it way back down to the basics.

[00:20:39.250] - Doreen
You might have seen him. It's like things that I wish I knew before I was 30. So, easy, right? Like, he's niche down, and he's helpful that's it.

[00:20:46.400] - Doreen
His reels are goals, highly recommend. So that is what I have been seeing, working really well on Instagram. It's like Niching way down and then tightening up your theme for 30 to 90 days at a time. And I know that I talked earlier about not finding your niche until you were doing it for a couple of years or whatever that is. But I'm talking about a content, niche or theme.

[00:21:07.370] - Doreen
It is kind of a better word, I guess. So, think of a theme that you can focus on for, like, 30 to 90 days. You don't have to be married to this. It doesn't have to be forever. This is just like you can take a little piece of your business and just talk only about that so I could do this.

[00:21:20.180] - Doreen
So, I'm a social media manager, I guess. Trying to think of like, oh, what are all the titles again? Niching, right? I can talk about Instagram. So that's Niche down. I can also talk about Instagram stories.

[00:21:32.940] - Doreen
I can talk about Instagram stories for a whole month. I could. So, how much can you niche down your topic? Right. And just do that as much as you can. 

[00:21:40.980] - Doreen
For products, it's a little bit trickier, but you have a digital product so that may make it easier. Yeah. What's a theme that you can focus on for a month? And that is what makes Sidney's reels so good is that when you click on his account or literally any of his reels, you know what you're going to get from him? You know what to expect, right?

[00:21:57.150] - Doreen
So, we don't have time today, obviously. Like I said, I could talk about each of these separate parts of Instagram for an entire month. But in a nutshell, on reals, keep them bite sized, well, okay, not even bite size.

[00:22:09.780] - Doreen
Keep them nibble sized. Like if you have a regular post, like, if you have a post in the grid, that's three bullets. Your reel is like one of those bullets. It's so tiny. It's so bite size.

[00:22:19.560] - Doreen
Second, using trending sounds might help your real performance. Like, no lie. That's cool. It's probably going to reach a lot of people. But think about first of all, what is that going to do for your business?

[00:22:32.260] - Doreen
Right. So, keep that top of mind when you're doing this stuff, because this is where we get, lost in a spin of the reels where, yeah, it's fun to see, like, 10,000 or a million views. But what's it actually doing for you. And we've had reals going viral on client accounts. And it's like, first of all, keeping up with the comments is a whole thing.

[00:22:50.880] - Doreen
It's impossible. And then also they're getting a ton of new followers. And that's cool. That makes us look really good. Right?

[00:22:56.660] - Doreen
Like, through the account from 1000 to 5000 or whatever the numbers are, that's awesome. But what is it doing for their bottom line? Nothing ,like their local business. They need local followers. So, yeah.

[00:23:10.430] - Doreen
Keep in mind what you're actually trying to do on your reels. So, if you just want reach and you do have a digital product, so it's not necessarily local, but you know what I mean? Keep that in mind. Dancing and lift ups are not always the best idea. So, I always say, like using your voice and your words are the best way to make your brand really sticky.

[00:23:29.710] - Doreen
Regurgitating what 100 other people have done? I don't know, like I don't know. It can be fun. I'm not saying I haven't done it, but I'm also like, really keep in mind what you're trying to do with reels.

[00:23:39.750] - Doreen
And again, I could talk about this for a month, so we're not going to super get into it, but be careful. You want to basically the video part of it is almost like a headline, right where you're using it to grab someone's attention. That's the point of the actual reel itself. And then the caption is the juicy part where that's what people want to say or comment on. So that's kind of how to structure it if you are ready to dig into reels, but you're kind of stuck on ideas again.

[00:24:03.060] - Doreen
I know this is going to come as a surprise, subscribe to the toolbox. Yeah, there's real prompts in there, too, with explanations, and I get way more into detail on all the stuff that I've kind of skimmed over just right here. So, hopefully, the last few minutes have been helpful. So, to quickly recap what we've covered. Perfect is not a thing.

[00:24:21.660] - Doreen
Better is a thing. And you're going to get better by showing up. That's the only way. So, yeah, that's really it reminder. It does not have to be perfect to be useful. Do you want to help people or not?

[00:24:32.540] - Doreen
I'm guessing. Yeah, you want to help. So that's how you're going to help by imperfect action. Second, consistent is different than constant. So, set a schedule that works for you in your season of life and stick to that.

[00:24:44.640] - Doreen
Third, build out your marketing strategy one layer at a time. So, I know that there's a million people that are doing a million more things than you, and they're telling you to do a million things as well, but really cut the distractions. quit with the high key stuff, like seriously, not necessary. And start focusing your efforts on marketing that works for real humans with real life like you and me.

[00:25:04.870] - Doreen
So that's really it in a nutshell. The toolbox is a lifesaver. As I've mentioned a few times. It's there if you need it. Thanks so much for listening.

[00:25:12.060] - Doreen
I appreciate your time. I am so glad that you're here. And like I said before, information is 20%. So, hopefully, you took a million notes and kind of got the information side down. So, now let's make rubber hit the pavement.

[00:25:24.490] - Doreen
It is time for action.
