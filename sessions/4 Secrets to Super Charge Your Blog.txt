Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit in our session today. I'm so excited to be here. In today's presentation, we are going to go over seven secrets to super charge your blog for success.

[00:00:28.010] - Cousett
Before we get started, a little bit about me, welcome to the Techie Mama world. 40 some years ago, I was born in Silicon Valley that pretty much made me a tech girl from day one. I made it official around 2003 with a degree in Computer science and have been designing, developing and teaching technology ever since. Before kids, I was a dissertation away from a PhD in educational technology.

[00:00:55.160] - Cousett
Now I'm on a mission to empower mompreneurs to automate, build and scale their businesses. I started Techie Mama as a small blog with a newborn in tow. Since then, it has grown and flourished into so much more. I have two incredible just as tech loving boys who are six and four already. My husband is invested in the Opensource online tech community as a WordPress core developer and a senior engineer at his company.

[00:01:25.440] - Cousett
We live in Silicon Hills or the Austin, Texas area. You can dive more into the Techie Mama world on social at Techie Mama or by joining our BFF community. Scan the QR code to get all of the details. Nobody wants to go to a slow site. If the site doesn't rank in Google, traffic will be low.

[00:01:50.210] - Cousett
So, the more traffic will show Google that the website is not only usable, but it also answers the right questions.

[00:02:00.790] - Cousett
Let's dive into these three. First up, we have SEO. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Winning the game of SEO comes down to attracting traffic to your site based on what someone is searching for using Google or any other search engine. But really, it's Google.

[00:02:20.660] - Cousett
There are two flavors of SEO, on-page SEO and off-page SEO. They refer to where things are optimized. On-page SEO is all about what a visitor experiences as they visit your page. This includes what you write, how it's organized, how it's presented, how it's formatted and the overall user experience, including site speed. Off-page SEO is everything outside of your site, building authority with backlinks, social media, brand mentions, and any other activities that happen away from your site.

[00:02:59.890] - Cousett
SEO is a huge topic, but some things to consider right away to get started include knowing and targeting your primary and secondary keywords, writing quality original content, formatting the content. So that it's easy for search engines to consume and understand, using things like featured snippets and other schemas, optimizing your page titles and meta descriptions, and using short descriptive URLs.

[00:03:32.810] - Cousett
Next up, we have traffic. There are many ways to bring more traffic to your site. These are some of the best tried and tested. As you consider these though, make sure you don't tackle all at once. To see the benefit and track the results, try out one at a time.

[00:03:49.690] - Cousett
So, first up, create amazing, share-worthy content. Again, we have the content. Content is king, it's the center of all. Share your content on social media, build your email list.

[00:04:05.550] - Cousett
So, if content is king, then email list is queen, if not more. It is hand in hand the two most powerful things I think for a blogger. Guest posting. So, guest posting involves posting your articles or your expertise on someone else's blog and also, possibly having someone else post on yours. It's a back and forth share of content and information and it gives Google a chance to see, hey, this person is an expert in what they're talking about because they're being featured on other sites and it builds authority and backlinks and trust with both Google and others as they're searching for you. Participate in online forums, reference others, collaborate with other content creators.

[00:04:58.300] - Cousett
I really, really enjoy this one. Collaborating with others in summits and bundles, I think is a great way to grow your email list, to build authority, and to just grow your community. Advertise, comment on blogs and create various forms of content. This last one as well, I think is super important. We all consume and prefer to consume content in different ways. When someone may enjoy reading and reads very quickly and consumes the information in a written format very quickly, someone else may enjoy hearing it and listening to it through an audiobook or through an audio feed. And whereas someone else may be very visual and may really like to see a video about it.

[00:05:46.090] - Cousett
So, having different forms of content also helps to reuse your content, repurpose your content, and also reaches out to a broader audience.

[00:05:58.760] - Cousett
Next up, we have my favorite quote or kind of factoid about speed. So, a one second delay in page load time yields 11% fewer views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and a 7% loss in conversions. This is huge. And speed is a huge issue and a huge kind of topic that you need to think about as a blogger, and so someone that gets very technical very quickly. So, depending on your platform and whether it's a self-hosted WordPress site or something else, you might have more or less control on all the factors that affect page speed. Some of the tips to get started and just some general rules of thumb when you're thinking about page speed is doing things like making sure all of your JavaScript and CSS files are external to your main site, as many things external as possible, so it's not loading down your page load. Using caching systems.

[00:07:11.310] - Cousett
Avoid resizing images in HTML, so making sure that your images are the right size and the right resolution for viewing on the web. Our phones these days take amazing photos, but they can pretty much be photos that can be hung up on a wall. The resolution is so incredible and so huge, it's definitely not something that's meant to be viewed online. So, make sure that you're resizing these and that you're resizing it away from your website before you upload it to your website. Hand in hand with resizing is using new file formats for images such as WebP and others that are optimized specifically for the web and optimized specifically to be, to have a good speed, a good page load on the web.

[00:08:08.590] - Cousett
And lastly, don't use images to display text. This is kind of an older habit of sites to do kind of a fancy button or something like that and use an image. But nowadays we really need to focus on text, just being text and not weighing down the site by using images where they're not necessary. The overarching idea here is what do you need on your site to convey your message and what is extra? So, think about little kind of extra fancy things on your site, like maybe image slider, or image gallery, or a chat feature, or something that's dynamically loaded.

[00:08:56.080] - Cousett
All of these little things are usually JavaScript that's loaded and all of that weighs down the site. Some of them, you may say, hey, a lot of people chat with me, and so that's something that I'm not willing to say no to. But others, like, maybe an image gallery or slider, you may say, well, it's a fancy little thing but it doesn't really need to be there. I can just put one thing there instead of having it cycled through. Same with popups and various things like that.

[00:09:33.790] - Cousett
So, think about what is necessary and what is extra or superfluous for your site and for conveying your message. Last but not least, we did not talk about ads and ad networks for passive income, but it's a popular option. I don't recommend it early on because you need to have so much traffic for it to make any kind of dent in your income. But the other flip side to that is that those ads also weighed on your site a lot. So, the more ads that you have popping up and showing up across the page, that's all going to add load time to your site and you want to really avoid that.

[00:10:18.340] - Cousett
So, think about those things, and think about what you can kind of remove to kind of slim down your site. And when it comes down to it, especially if you have a WordPress site where you have a lot of control over a lot of these things, if it's too much to handle on your own, if it's too technical, search out a developer that might be able to help, that might be able to kind of really dive into some of the issues. Another thing with WordPress sites, we'll talk about this in the next slide, but all hosting companies are not made equal. So, if your site is really slow and you're thinking there's not really that much going on, think about your host, and whether it might not be the host that is not optimized for websites. There's a lot that goes on for hosting a website.

[00:11:13.920] - Cousett
And the more sites that they can host on a server, the more, the cheaper it is for them to, you know, host each one and the cheaper rates that they can pass on to the customer. But what that does is it really divides their resources and way too many customers. And each individual site gets only a sliver of the total resources, which ends up meaning that there's a big effect on page speed.

[00:11:49.840] - Cousett
Alright. So, last up, we have our last secret for our blogging supercharge tips is a combination of maintenance topics and a few extra things that can add to the depth and breadth of your blog. So, first, for some maintenance tips, this is especially talking for those who have self-hosted WordPress sites where you have a lot more control and a lot more responsibility for maintenance than if it's hosted with another platform like Square Space or Wix, or so many others out there. WordPress is what I know, WordPress is what I've done for 10-15 years.

[00:12:34.390] - Cousett
And so, WordPress is what I can talk about a lot. Some of these things may relate to other platforms and some may not. But I couldn't tell you what relates to what. So, for self-hosted WordPress sites, you want to make sure to keep up with security. WordPress powers close to 36% of the web and hackers love to try and break into sites. So, keeping up with the security of your site by making sure your host value security, your site itself is secure from hackers. It's really, really important.

[00:13:14.660] - Cousett
Pick a good hosting company. So, we kind of started talking about this, there are so many options for WordPress sites out there when it comes to hosting, they are not all created equal. And a solid host will be the difference many times between a slow site, a secure site and good support, and not having those things. Keep up with SSL certificates. So, making sure that your site is secure with an SSL certificate, is super important. Years ago, Google decided to take secure sites into account when ranking, and now it's so hard to find a site that's not secure. You want to look for the padlock that is in the top left hand corner of the address bar. It does require a little bit of maintenance sometimes.

[00:14:02.800] - Cousett
If you have a certificate that renews and it doesn't auto-renew by the host, then you might have to go and click a button, so that it renews. It's not much, but it is something that you have to remember to go to. Your host should for sure offer certificates free of charge. If they don't, then consider changing hosts. Certificates are available free of charge.

[00:14:28.690] - Cousett
They used to be more complex to create, and so they cost. Now they are completely free. There's many options for certificates to be free and if your host isn't on top of that, then it may be time to consider changing hosts. Using strong and secure passwords, this is so important in today's world where so much of our information is out there. Making sure you have access to a password manager and can create secure passwords, it's super important for your site and for your data.

[00:15:04.240] - Cousett
If you can enhance security with two-factor authentication, it's just a bonus. It's so important to use strong passwords and not to share passwords and to do everything you can to kind of maintain your data, because it can be hacked so easily and it can cause so many issues so easily. Maintaining backups on your host and off your host. A couple of years ago, there was a hosting company, they decided one day, for whatever reason, to just completely shut down and not inform their customers at all about it. So, overnight, they shut down their social media accounts, they shut down their email, they shut down their support networks, and they shut down their website, and they shut down the websites of all of their customers.

[00:15:57.360] - Cousett
They woke up the next morning and found out that all of their content, all of their business, all of their web presence on their website was gone. The host no longer existed. The host did not respond to inquiries. The backups were on the host, and it was gone. Another scenario was someone who woke up, found out that their site was gone, that their business data was gone, that their content was gone.

[00:16:27.110] - Cousett
But they knew that they had backups easily accessible on Dropbox or Google Drive or AWS. They went to the next host and said, hey, my site's down. I need a new host. Here's my backup. Can you get me back up and running?

[00:16:44.910] - Cousett
And within hours, maybe less, they were back up and running and set to go. So, having backups off-site of your host is so important. It's so important to have it on your computer, on Dropbox, wherever you want to put it. Basically, content that you're not really going to touch until you need it. So, you just need some space out there, space on the backup drive, space somewhere to put it until that day that you need it.

[00:17:18.490] - Cousett
These next few things are just additional things that you can build around your blog to additionally have income sources, create community, and expand your reach and expertise. All right. Our action steps. So, what will your first secret be that you want to kind of attack to supercharge your blog? And then second, similar but a little different, what secret do you think will help your blog the most at your current stage?

[00:17:49.120] - Cousett
So, do you think that speed is an issue, site speed is an issue? Do you think that your SEO could be improved a lot? What do you think will make the most impact on your blog at your current stage? And this may be similar to your item for number one, or maybe completely different, so.

[00:18:11.360] - Cousett
What I want you to do here is just think of just one or two things of all this content. We covered a lot in the time that we have together. There's so much content here and there's so much to consider and there are so many topics to dive deeper into because we just skim the surface on all of these. So, think about just one thing that you want to do. One thing that is going to be your first action step, your first secret that you're going to tackle, and move forward with that and then go to the next one.

[00:18:43.770] - Cousett
And don't be afraid to ask for help and ask for what others have done because you may get some answers that way.

[00:18:55.090] - Cousett
But overall, just don't try to do too many things at once. It gets overwhelming very quickly. So, pick one thing and move forward with it. All right. So, some of my favorite things and resources, you know that I'm tech girl, techie mama, and I love to test different tools. I love to break tools and use them to their capacity.

[00:19:22.390] - Cousett
And my preferences change a lot as the technology changes. And I'm looking for that silver bullet that will do the task I wanted to do in the exact way that I wanted to do. So, I usually qualify my recommendations with my current favorites because things can change so quickly. So, let's dive in here. Currently, Google Domains is my preference to register domains.

[00:19:47.920] - Cousett
It's super slick, it's super straightforward, and the prices don't fluctuate, they're just solid. If for whatever reason, the extension that you're looking to purchase is not available on Google Domains, Hover and Namecheap are also some great options for registering domains. Google workspace also is amazing for email and the whole Google suite on your domain. It builds authority, it builds kind of your expertise and your presence to have that branded email address. And Google workspace is a great way to acquire that. For these next couple are for self-hosted WordPress sites, so for hosting Flywheel iss my choice because they're great for beginners, they have amazing support and features and they're fairly affordable in comparison to others.

[00:20:53.660] - Cousett
And then also Elementor Pro is great for landing pages as a builder. Bloomberg, the built-in builder in WordPress, is also super flexible and it's just amazing how it's growing and changing the world of things as we are experiencing it. Elementor can have some issues with speed. It can weigh down your site. So, I really, really recommend that you keep it as landing page builder and do not do any blog posts or normal pages with Elementor.

[00:21:35.890] - Cousett
ConvertKit is my current tool for email marketing and currently happy with it. It's great for beginners. I want to say that I tried so many and ConvertKit was the first one where things started clicking as far as automation and segmenting and doing some different things. They have a great ecommerce built-in and some great tools, and they're great for bloggers and creators. And Thrive Cart, my business wouldn't be where it is today without Thrive Cart. After so many trial and errors to have a shopping cart, to have ecommerce presence on my site.

[00:22:16.990] - Cousett
It never equal to what has been revolutionized in my sales with Thrive Cart. Convert box is also amazing and incredibly powerful for your lead magnets, for offering personalized offers, for kind of knowing your visitors and knowing which offers they've seen, which ones they haven't, and offering them the right things at the right time, so you can segment your different visitors in a good way. And then last but not least, the super popular Shopify. This is definitely a new venture in my business, but it is trusted for ecommerce by so many and it is a solid option for creating any type of storefront. I'm really enjoying my experience with Shopify and it also has features of email marketing and blogging.

[00:23:09.600] - Cousett
So, if you're looking at doing something that is ecommerce first, it's definitely a solid option for including those other things. Or if you're just adding a storefront to your blog, then it can definitely be on a subdomain or a different domain and be kind of linked together. Lastly, I have a gift for you. I hope you enjoy.
