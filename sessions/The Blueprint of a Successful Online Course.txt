[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm thrilled today to have Katie here talking about course creation. Katie, thank you so much for doing this on me. I appreciate it.

[00:00:08.990] - Katie Hornor
You're so welcome. I'm super happy to be here.

[00:00:11.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. You're going to be talking about, I think it's blueprint to course creation or something. Can you give us the highlights of what you're going to be covering in your session?

[00:00:23.130] - Katie Hornor
All right. So my background is that I have a master's in teaching and curriculum development. I go into course creation a little bit different than other folks. We've created 25 some courses online in the last couple of years. But we're really looking at how do we create a content that is going to push people through to get that transformation step by step so that our marketing is less work because our people got the transformation and they're super excited about it. So we're going to be talking about rubrics. We're going to be talking about your student experience, just a whole lot of things that a lot of those other quick and easy, create your course and get it out there today things don't go into.

[00:01:04.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, they cover like, okay, these are the steps you need to take to create your course and to launch it. But this is diving deep more into how you structure the content, it sounds like. Exactly. So both important, but just a little different.

[00:01:18.400] - Katie Hornor
Right. It's a different take on things and something that is easy to overlook, but can be really key for a good experience for your students.

[00:01:26.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Exactly. All right. So let's go ahead and dive in.

[00:01:31.770] - Katie Hornor
Hey, it's Katie Hornor, and I am thrilled to be coming to you on this summit today to talk about the Course Creation Blueprint and how you can go deep into your curriculum to create an amazing experience for the students of your course. So hang tight today. You'll need the notes. Download below because we're going to go through some things pretty quickly, and you'll want to take notes on some others. So if you don't have it, go get that download sheet at KatieHornor.Com/summit or at the link below this video. Be sure that you have that as we get ready to delve into the material today. Okay, so just as a matter of introduction, if we are meeting here for the first time, again, my name is Katie Hornor, and I am the founder of handprintlegacy.Com and Lemonhaus.com. And I'm the creator of over 24 online courses, including successful online courses, which is the reason that you are here today. Successful online courses is our premium flagship program that we are super proud of. It is helping business owners, coaches, and practitioners in all kinds of niches create premium online courses. You know, whether you end up learning how to create your course from me or from somebody else, you need to know what to look for in an expert instructor, correct?

[00:02:47.680] - Katie Hornor
You always want to learn from an expert. You want to learn from someone who has had the head knowledge and the life experience, who has been through the trainings and the processes, who has put in the time and done this themselves and have something to show for it. In terms of our qualifications, let me just share that in our business, my husband and I, and here's a picture of our family, I have a master's degree in education and curriculum development. We have created a complete eight-grade level homeschool curriculum in another language. Lemonhaus is our Spanish language business that supports the Spanish homeschool community around the world. So we have created more than We've had 24 online courses in the history of our business, and we've had over 6,000 students, almost 7,000 students go through our online courses just in the last three years. So I'm not just telling you some stuff that you can use to throw together and make some money quick here. My goal, my heart in this is to help you get your course, your premium course, created so that it can be an asset for your business. I want to see you create something that will help you package your genius in such a way that you can transfer your genius to other people and create a legacy by doing so.

[00:04:06.300] - Katie Hornor
An asset that can outlive you in your business and continue to teach that genius that you have to future generations. So I'm going to give you our step-by-step system via this course creation cheat sheet and the information in this webinar. If you got the course creation cheat sheet, which I hope you did when you signed up for this webinar, we're going to walk you through all of those pieces that are in teal on that resource. You'll see those teal boxes around certain content. That's what we're covering here in this first part today. If you don't have the cheat sheet, please click on the button below and download it because we're going to be walking through all of those particular parts of this resource. How is this going to change your life? Well, I know how it's changed my life. I know how it's helped us earn income, how it's helped us have a bigger impact, and helped our students have a bigger impact. I'm going to be telling you more about that in a second. But before we go any further, I want you to know that I am committed to playing full out in the next hour of this training, and I want to ask you to play full out, too.

[00:05:12.130] - Katie Hornor
This is information that can change your life, but you have got to be willing to pay attention. And maybe you've already heard some of this before. I don't want you to just discard what I'm saying because you think, Oh, I've heard that before. You may have. You may be doing some of the things already that I'm going to be talking about, but I want you to keep an open mind, and I want you to look at the information that I'm presenting and ask yourself, How can I apply this to my business? Even if it's not completely new, is there a new way to look at it? How could I take something that He's teaching me here and put it into practice to up my game, to make a bigger impact, to increase the income that we already have coming in, to increase our time freedom, to increase the impact, the change that we're able to make in the world. I'm going to do everything I can to maximize the value that you get from our limited time here together. And I'm going to promise you that I will show you how you can learn more.

[00:06:09.880] - Katie Hornor
This is not a challenge. This is an opportunity for you to multiply your income and to multiply your legacy impact. Back in early elementary math, when you learn that two plus two is four, well, that was one level. But man, when you got up to where you were learning 10 times 10, now Now you're on a new level. And that's why I'm taking you tonight. We're looking at the multiplication phase of course creation. We're not looking at course creation as a challenge. We're not looking at it on the first level. We're not looking at course creation as a get-rich-quick thing either. I don't want you thinking you can just get-rich-quick overnight with this. But we're looking at course creation from the perspective that this is an opportunity for you to multiply your time freedom and multiply your income and your impact. It's so important when you think about the impact side of what a difference this can make in your lifetime and beyond it. I've been teaching for over two decades. I've got a master's degree in education. I've spent time teaching in public schools and Christian schools, in ministry settings, in secular settings. I've been a speaker on international conference stages for the past six years.

[00:07:25.030] - Katie Hornor
We created a full homeschool curriculum over at Lemonhaas.Com. We've and online conferences. And there's one thing that I want to tell you that if you're looking for something that's going to make you an overnight success story, it's not courses. But if you're looking for something that's going to give you an opportunity to make a legacy impact that spans generation while giving you time, freedom, and more income, it is definitely courses. Teaching has been around as long as the Earth has existed. I mean, we We pass everything down by way of teaching. Everything that we learn, we learn from someone else teaching in some way. Some people today still focus on throwing courses together quickly so you can get it out there and make more money. That's not what I'm teaching here. My heart is to focus on the quality of what you're putting out there so that the quality of the curriculum that you create and the quality of the student experience that you give your people will allow them to learn what you give them in a way that you can get them all the way to the transformation through the application to the transformation of that thing that your genius teaches.

[00:08:40.590] - Katie Hornor
You want them to take full ownership of the genius that you are passing on to them. I mean, if something happened to you tomorrow, I'm not saying it will, please don't misunderstand that, but think about what would happen in your business? What would happen to your family if something happened to you tomorrow? If you were incapacitated, if you If you could no longer participate in your business, if you could no longer teach one-to-one or real-life classes the way you do now, who would continue to teach those things that you know? Who would continue to do those one-on-ones that you're spending so much of your work time doing? If you're not training someone else to do it, if you're not preserving your genius in some way that it can be taught without you present, your business is not going to survive without you. And so this is not just an asset for your business. It also becomes a tool by which you can take yourself out of your business. You can start to remove yourself from your business even now and allow your business the strength and the capability of surviving without you or surviving beyond you, if that were to be the case.

[00:09:50.200] - Katie Hornor
So you see how this changes everything? You see how having a premium online course is better than the old way of just doing what we know until we're done? Do you see how courses give you a vision that will allow you to have an impact into the future? Are you ready to learn how to create that premium online course? So a lot of us struggle with either money or making an impact. And I know because I've been there. When we first started our business way back in the early years, 2010, 2012-ish, every day was a big struggle. One of our biggest struggles was finances, but the other one was the fact that we felt so compelled to make a bigger impact, and we just weren't growing fast enough to be able to see that impact happen as quickly as we wanted it to. When we started our business, my husband and I were in Mexico with four kids. A ministry opportunity that we had sold all of our belongings in order to move to Southern Mexico and spend the rest of our lives doing had just been pulled out from under our feet. When that happened, the financial support that we had been promised went away as well.

[00:11:01.500] - Katie Hornor
We didn't have enough money in the bank to even get back to the US if we wanted to. And at that point, we really didn't want to because by that time, we had fallen in love with Mexico so much. We wanted to stay. We wanted to find a way to support ourselves so that we could stay and continue to do what we love doing and serving the Spanish-speaking people. But we had to be able to come up with a business that would allow us to do this. And so when we realized that there was a need in the homeschool community that we could fill, we started putting together that homeschool curriculum in Spanish that would serve these people. And then later, this became online courses to support first-time homeschool parents. And now we have an annual online summit, which It was the first in history online summit for Spanish-speaking homeschool parents. When we started, I remember specifically saying to my husband, When we get to the point that this is earning money for us, I want to be able to teach other people how to do this, I want to teach them how they can bring an income for their family, how they can make a bigger impact than they dreamed of with the genius that they have.

[00:12:08.680] - Katie Hornor
And that's where we are today. That's what has happened for us over these last few years of all that trial and error and struggle that we went through to bootstrap this business and build it up on our own. All of our mistakes are now there to guide and help others progress faster and easier to their goals of impact and increased income. So you can learn from the mistakes that we made, and you can learn from the thousands of dollars that we spent through the years in training. You can learn from our educational training and experience. And so I'm going to show you how to start with these five strategies in the cheat sheet, and in the end, how to go on and impact 6,000 and 7,000 and tens of thousands more with your genius in the next three years, just like we have. And what I'm teaching you today is coming right out of that program, successful online courses. Okay, so if you have your course creation cheat sheet, and again, if you don't, please download it below the video, the course creation cheat sheet, we're going to be looking at step two, which is planning your course content.

[00:13:15.070] - Katie Hornor
Like I said, this is my area of expertise. This is what I went to school for. This is what I got a master's degree in. This is what I have lived and breathed for the past 20 some years. This is something I use every single day. And so first of all, when you're creating your course content, you've got to be able to decide how many modules it's going to take to build your course. How many modules are you going to put into this? How many sections of course content? Which basically means how many steps are there to get your students from where they are now to that transformation that they want. So I recommend three to five modules that you can put into your course. And we use odd numbers just because that seems to psychologically do better, right? But three Three to five modules, and you can make your notes right there in the cheat sheet. How many modules do you need to have? Think about what it is that you're teaching. How many steps, how many big steps are there to get your people from where they are now to where they need to be?

[00:14:13.910] - Katie Hornor
So whether that's three or four or five, you're going to break each one of those steps into smaller steps or lessons within that module. So think of the lessons like micro steps that are going to get them to finish that bigger step in the process. So the module is the bigger step, and inside the module are the lessons or the step by step for how to complete that one bigger step in the process. You don't want to have your lessons very long. People like to consume content in shorter pieces, so keep your lessons short, keep them to the point. You don't need to spend a lot of extra time. Just say it, get it done, and go on. But the cheat sheet here on page six This is where you're going to want to note on the cheat sheet on page 6 is where you're going to want to note those ideas for each of those lessons. It's not going to be everything you know. We want to remember simple is superior and think about what is the absolute most necessary information they're going to need to get this done, to finish this big step in the process?

[00:15:23.760] - Katie Hornor
What are the step-by-step instructions that's going to get them there? Each lesson is a piece of the puzzle that's important them to know as they get this one step done. When they get all the steps or the modules done and you get them to that transformation, then they're at the end of Module 5, they're going to look back and see how easy it was because you were able to break it down into those three or five big steps for them. People don't buy courses because you're going to teach them everything you know about the topic. They're buying your course because they trust that you're going to give them the step-by-step, simple, clear instructions for getting them from where they are now to that desired transformation. You're going to show them how to solve their problem. Within your lessons, you want to think about things like giving them examples or telling stories. You may want to include activities or materials list, depending on what your topic is and what you're teaching. You may want to make notes about those things here on this page because they're going to be important for you to include in your lesson when you're actually writing out your lesson plan and your content outline to teach from.

[00:16:32.860] - Katie Hornor
Now, when I was in college, we were talking a lot about the word rubric. If you don't know what a rubric is, a very basic definition is that it's like a schema or a table chart, something like that, that lays out very clearly what the student is required to do in order to pass the class, like what the assignment is, how the assignment is evaluated, how many points they're going to get for doing that thing. If you do this, The result will be this. If you do this, the result will be this. This is how you're progressing through this class. And so that's something that you can create for your course and for your modules, for your students in your online course. It's part of one of the most successful keys to a successful course and successfully getting your people through it because now they know what to expect. They know what they need to do or to complete in order to get that result, to finish that step. And so you can also use this as part of a gamification piece, which we go into full detail in in the successful online courses program.

[00:17:33.200] - Katie Hornor
But gamification is that strategy that will help to move them through your course. It keeps them working towards that final result, that final transformation. And so they're under each module on that page six. You want to plan out each of those step by step lessons for each of those bigger module steps that's going to get your students from A to B, solve the problem that your course is promising to solve. Now, moving on to page 7, the teal section on page seven is where we highlighted the part about recording your lessons. And again, we're going to go much deeper into this than successful online courses, but I didn't feel like the cheat sheet was quite detailed enough to give you the good overview. So for this second strategy, let me just go through this with you quickly. When you're recording your lessons, it is so much easier for you as a teacher to create a general outline based based on that step or that transformation that you want your students to achieve in each lesson. You don't have to script the whole thing. Let me say that again. You don't have to script the whole thing.

[00:18:43.690] - Katie Hornor
We would be here until we were 105 if you had to write out word for word every single thing you plan to say in this course. And so what I have found easier and faster is to create an outline of the points that I want to make. I would note any important I have the information that I absolutely cannot leave out. And then I'll leave a list of resources or whatever in the course, maybe below the video. But I'll just teach from that outlined. Just talk or explain or teach from that outline that I've created of the high points because I know the stuff. You're the expert. You know this content, backwards and forwards and inside and outwards. So just create that outline of the points that are most important for them to and then just talk from your outline, teach from your outline. Because when you are concerned about having to get in every single word or about reading from your script and making it sound normal or those kinds of things become a hindrance to us, a distraction to us as we're teaching. The outline is going to keep you on task. It's going to help you keep on track to be sure that you're not missing any important content, but it's not going to limit you in terms of the perfectionism and and all of that other stuff that can get in the way when you're trying to get those teaching pieces completed.

[00:20:07.080] - Katie Hornor
Also, in terms of logistics, you want to be careful to always keep your mouth in the same place in relation to your microphone Or if you're using camera, always be sure to face the microphone on the camera, especially when you're doing video. Now, if you're doing audio, then, of course, try to keep your mouth the same distance from the microphone each time that you do it. Try to keep the same amount of energy, like when you're recording a podcast episode. But then if you're doing video, you also want to be concerned about looking at the camera, facing the camera. Make the student feel like they're the only one in the world that you are talking to and really make that connection with them. You also want to minimize distractions that can come in the form of noise in the area when you're recording, or it can come in the form of distractions in your background, especially when you set up your camera. Try to take a picture of what the student is going to be looking at. So the picture from your computer screen or your camera screen towards you and beyond, and look at that picture and see what you have in your background, what's behind you.

[00:21:15.170] - Katie Hornor
You don't want to have a shirt thrown across the back of the chair somewhere or toys in the middle of the room or a window that's making funny shadows. You just never know what's going to show up in those backgrounds. So be sure that you're double checking your background before before you do those videos. There's all kinds of crazy things that can get into the background and become a distraction. You want to minimize those as much as you can, especially when you're doing the video. All right, now let's move on to page 10. And in On page 10, we're talking about your third strategy, which is your launch plan. Here again, I know there's a lot of people who place the majority of their focus on the marketing piece of course creation. Your launch plan is important for successful online course, but I just want to reiterate that it doesn't matter how well you can market your course if your content that we talked about in the previous section doesn't help them get to the transformation. When you're launching, you want to let your audience know the date that you're going to open your course registrations in advance.

[00:22:18.110] - Katie Hornor
You want to start talking about it ahead of time. Let them know that this is coming. You want to give them a hint, start building this buzz around the opening of your course. You're going to to create images for sharing on social media. If you've been through our business branding masterclass, then you know that this is a super important key here. You want to be able to create images that are both on point with your brand, but also congruent with each other. This is especially important if you're going to be running ads for your open car or your launch, because platforms like Facebook will be expecting you to have a very similar looking image and wording on the landing page that they go to from Facebook as that particular ad did. And so you want to be sure that you're keeping everything congruant. People are like, Oh, yes, I saw this on Facebook. It's the same thing over here. I know he's talking about the same thing. So keep it congruence so that people are recognizing this no matter what platform they're seeing it on and keep them branded to your course and to each other.

[00:23:25.590] - Katie Hornor
I know sometimes we like to branch out and do things that are going to attract attention, but But you do still need to keep it congruant in your branding. Then you want to ask folks to opt in to your sales page in advance. You can get your sales page done ahead of time so that you can go ahead and start collecting those emails, put up a waitlist type thing there so that it's there and you can begin to talk about it and people can sign up for notification when you do open your cart. And that way you're already beginning to build your list of people who are interested in this before you're actually ready to open it for them. You'll want to email your list and ask them to opt in to the waitlist. And then once your course is open, you're definitely going to want to email that list again and give them that invitation again to join your course. You can ask friends, you can ask former students or former clients to help you share about the course that this is coming. This could be something just as simple as, Hey, you know what I do.

[00:24:27.030] - Katie Hornor
You know the impact that it's had on your life. You know how I've helped I would love for you to share this. Would you help me get the word out? Who do you know that needs this course that I'm creating? And many of those people are going to be super happy to help you share about that new course. If you already have a following on social media, of course, enlist their help in sharing it with people they know who need help with that topic. You can submit guests posts to blogs. You can guest on podcasts that are going to air near the times that you're going to launch. And this is especially good strategy. If you've got something free that leads into your waitlist for your course, this is a really good thing because while podcasters are usually a little bit less inclined to just let you sell from their show, if you've got a gift or a freebie that they can offer their people, then that makes them look really good. They're not selling on the show. They're giving things away. And it allows you a chance to invite their audience to become your audience and to get in on your list and sign up for that waitlist.

[00:25:29.520] - Katie Hornor
Host. And so that's a really good strategy for letting people know about your launch. So think about where you could possibly either guest post on a blog or be a guest on a podcast during this time that you're coming up on your launch period. And then when you do launch, Be sure that you're going back to those people, to the blog host, to the podcast host, and let them know that you've launched. And maybe something like, Hey, we just opened cart on our course. Would you mind sharing that episode again where you interviewed me and just let people know that the course is now open? And many of them would be happy to share that out again to their audience. You also want to be preparing your launch week emails for when you will open cart. The open cart can be a really busy week when you're answering people's questions and you're doing Facebook Live and trying to get all this other stuff done, take care of customers and their last minute questions and things like that. You definitely want to do as much of the work as you can in advance to try to minimize the stress during that Opencart week.

[00:26:34.770] - Katie Hornor
So speaking from experience, someone who has done eight different launches in the last nine months, I definitely know what I'm talking about here. OpenCart can be stressful. So please hear me when I say that you want to do as much as you can in advance. As much as possible, get it done in advance, especially when it comes to writing those emails or preparing your social media post, getting your images created, all of that stuff can be done in advance, and that frees you up to be less stressed when you're trying to push out those daily reminders during Open Cart Week. And we have tools that do that. You can pre-schedule emails, you can pre-schedule social media posts. So very easy to get that done in advance and be a little bit ahead of the game. All right. And then the fourth strategy that we're talking about is on page 11, and this is the overdelivery. You want to make your students feel welcomed and wanted and respected. Once you open cart and you have people joining your course, you want to give them an amazing experience right from the beginning. And you want to be sure that they feel welcomed and wanted and respected and seen and heard, you want to be able to call them out and welcome them in.

[00:27:51.420] - Katie Hornor
You want to congratulate them for taking action, reinforce that they made a good decision. You want to be sure that you're doing everything possible to make them feel welcome and safe in this environment so that they can have optimal learning in your course. So in the Successful Online Courses program, we go into a whole lot more detail about several different strategies that you can put into play here to go over the top in making sure that students of all personalities and learning styles have an amazing experience as a student in your course. You're also going to want to remind them in advance of any live classes or calls that may be involved with your course. You don't want to stop emailing them when your cart closes. You need to continue the conversation, continue the communication. Now you need to let these students know the different ways that you're going to be serving them by continuing to keep them up to speed on announcements. If you've got live calls coming up, let them know in advance. When you release a new module, send them a notice. If there's a replay, send them a notice. Keep them up to date with what's going on with your email correspondence.

[00:28:58.780] - Katie Hornor
And then another Another way to overdeliver is to include games or competitions whenever possible. You want to try to keep their attention. Some people are super competitive, and that little bit of competitiveness is going to go a long way to push them through the content to make it to the end. So make it something that they can enjoy participating in. Other people just really like being entertained, right? They want to enjoy the process, not so much compete, but enjoy what it is that they're doing. And so Do whatever you can to make that an enjoyable experience for them. And then you've got some people who just enjoy the socialization part of sharing with the other people in the same experience. And so you want to be intentional about including different ways that you can overdeliver on this experience and encourage your people to move forward through that content. One of our students just posted this week. She said, I didn't even realize I was stuck yesterday. And in 15 minutes, Katie came in and helped you make a plan and move forward. That's the thing that you want to do for your students. Look for ways that you can help them when maybe they don't even realize that they're stuck to move them forward towards that transformation.

[00:30:13.840] - Katie Hornor
And then our fifth strategy, and this is not necessarily on your cheat sheet, but it's that when you're presenting your course opportunity to two of your people, they're different. All right? So when you're thinking about this launch and you want to be able to make the application and be sure that you're customizing your language or customizing the transformation to the different people you're trying to reach and their specific needs. I know I gave the example in the For your Success podcast episode 74. We talked about the cake decorators and how one person might be taking the cake decorating course because they have a bakery business and they want to be able to have cakes that sell at higher prices, right? And somebody else may be taking the cake decorating course just because they want to enjoy creating cakes. They want a relaxing hobby that makes them feel like they're creating something beautiful. So you're offering both of those people the same course, but you're going to customize your message according to their desired outcomes in order to help those unique individuals realize that this is the course they need and to give them a better experience as they're going through the course.

[00:31:23.400] - Katie Hornor
I hope that makes sense. All right. Now, I told you I was also going to debunk several myths that be holding you back from getting started on creating your premium online course. So the first myth, we're going to transition into this now and talk about the first myth. And this is something that I see over and over and over again. People will say something like, Oh, I would love to have a course, but I'm not techy. It's so overwhelming. I don't know how to do all that tech stuff that I need to do to create videos and put information up on a platform and connect it and email. I just don't understand how to do that. I'm going to tell you, you do not have to be techy to have a course. There are so many tools out there that make things super simple. In our successful online courses program, we walk you through step by step, and we help you work through those tech issues so that it is not overwhelming, and it is something that becomes very easy for you to do. We recommend the teachable platform, which, full disclosure here, I am an affiliate for them.

[00:32:32.460] - Katie Hornor
I think Teachable is the absolute best program out there for beginning course creators and for advanced course creators. I mean, Pat Flynn uses them. And so the Teachable system is very simple and straightforward, and it's just pretty much drag and drop. And yet it looks really good on the student end as well. It gives a really good student experience. And so that's what I recommend. And that's what we walk you through creating your course on. That's the platform that we recommend that you use. So you don't have to be tech savvy as long as you can focus on one step at a time. And we give you all of those steps in order to be able to get your course up there. So the second myth that I see people saying a lot is, Oh, I can't create a course. I'm not good on video. I'm not comfortable on video. Well, let me tell you, video is not the only way to create a course. There are so many different ways to put content out there. Video is one of them, and it is one of the most effective, depending a little bit on your topic of choice, but it's not a have to thing.

[00:33:39.630] - Katie Hornor
So maybe your people enjoy audio better. You could just create some audio files right from your phone on an audio recorder and use that for your course. I mean, people are learning on audio via podcast every day, right? Successful online courses teaches you about all the different ways that you can deliver your instruction. And in Module One, it actually helps you decide what is What's the best method of delivery of content for you and for your audience? What's the best way for them to consume it? And if you do decide that video is the way to go, we've also included a special lesson for you that teaches you some video tips so that it will help you do that successfully as well. We're going to help you get over that fear if you do indeed decide to use video in your course. The third myth that people often is, Oh, I can't have a course. I don't have an email list, or my email list isn't very big. It's not big enough for a course. Well, having a website and an email list isn't a prerequisite to having a course. I know people who had a book first and then created a course.

[00:34:47.000] - Katie Hornor
I have a client who actually created a course first and then created her book from the course, and both of those without necessarily having a big email list at all. It is correct that it is easier sometimes to sell your course if you already have a following built up somewhere, social media, for instance. But you'll be able to create and sell your course whether or not you already have a website and email list when you enroll in successful online courses. You Follow the steps that we lay out for you. It's going to work. We had one case study recently who had a list of 150 people. They sold six courses to that list and made over $1,000 in that one launch. So it is entirely possible. We know some people who have sold to a list of over 5,000 and made money off their course. And we know people who have sold to a list of 50,000. It doesn't really matter the size of your following. What matters is that you have people who are engaged with you and are aligned with what you're offering, that they are seeking the solution that you offer them and that you're able to communicate clearly to them so that they understand that you have the transformation that they're trying to get to.

[00:35:58.370] - Katie Hornor
Okay? And so That leads us then to the fourth myth, the final myth that we're going to talk about today, which is creating a course is too expensive. I don't have all the money to invest in a bunch of programs in order to get my course created. Again, this simply is not true. If you have a way to deliver emails, you can create a very simple and effective course just through your email. Now, there are tools available and you can get as complicated and as expensive as you want to, but you don't have to have all of those things to have a successful online course. You can't use this as an excuse to not create your course and get your transformational message out to the world. I'm sorry, it's just not going to work. There are lots of different ways. You can get a course out there very inexpensively, and the successful in the courses program is the place to learn how to do that with just an email list or with just a very low cost platform to host your course on. It's very inexpensive to get this out there. And in terms what you're going to reap in income, it doesn't even make sense to even entertain the argument that this is too expensive for you to do.

[00:37:07.780] - Katie Hornor
It's almost backwards. It's almost like it's so inexpensive to create a course these days. Why would you not? And so those are the four myths debunked for you. And just to review that real quickly, you don't have to be techy to have a course. You don't have to have a big email list to have a course. You don't have to be comfortable on video. You don't even have to use video. There's other ways to create content. There are inexpensive ways to get your course out there. You can create content when you know how to move your people from A to Z to get that transformation. You can over deliver to them in terms of the experience. You can do the launch just with the steps that we've outlined in this cheat sheet. So what I want to ask you right now is, are you committed to moving forward?
