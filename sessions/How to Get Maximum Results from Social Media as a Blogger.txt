Hi everyone, and thank you for joining me. Today we're going to talk about how you can get maximum results from social media as a blogger. But before we dive in, let me first introduce myself. Hi. My name is Anca.

[00:00:25.930] - Anca
I'm a customer success specialist at Socialbee.io. If you don't know what SocialBee is, don't worry. We're a social media management tool that empowers businesses and entrepreneurs to be consistent in their social media presence. And we also help you save more time and be better at your social media journey with less effort. While at SocialBee, I've been guiding our users to start doing more on their social media and being more consistent in their scheduling.

[00:01:00.060] - Anca
And hopefully, I can do the same for you guys today. So, let's go into a little bit of what are we going to talk about today? By the end of this conference, you'll know a little bit on how you can choose the social media platforms that work for you, the role of social media plays in your strategy, how you can build your strategy, and so much more. If you're ready to dive in, let's go. First things first, let's talk about how you can choose the perfect platforms for your business and how you choose your audience as well.

[00:01:37.390] - Anca
The thing that needs to happen first is to select your audience or to make sure you define your audience, so to speak. So, depending on what platforms you want to use or what audience you have, you're going to have to use specific channels to reach that audience. And typically, based on age groups, you can kind of understand where your audience is at. So, think first, who am I talking about? Who needs to hear what I have to say?

[00:02:08.650] - Anca
And then we're going to go into where are they spending their time? If they're Gen Z, they might be spending their time on Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube, snapchat, whatever.

[00:02:20.440] - Anca
Older generations, millennials and older might be going to Facebook. There might be going to Twitter, YouTube as well, depending on what type of content you're sharing. But if you're also working more in a B to B niche, you're going to focus on LinkedIn as well. So, consider all of these aspects and see what platforms are best suited for your existing audience. When you're looking at the social media channels that you're going to use and how they work for the people that you want to reach, you're going to have to see what people look for in specific social media platforms.

[00:03:00.460] - Anca
For example, Instagram, people look to be educated. They look to be inspired or motivated or entertained in any way, so that they can spend their time in a good vibe, so to speak. On the other hand, if you look at Twitter, text dominates, whereas Instagram has more video and images you can look at. Depending on the type of content that you're sharing, where your audience might be going for that specific type of content. If you're looking at LinkedIn, on the other hand, you might have content going out for professionals, right?

[00:03:43.260] - Anca
So, you see case studies, you see infographics, you might see white papers, you might see thought leaders sharing their opinions with the professionals in that industry. So, focus on what each social media platform has to offer and think about the types of content that you can include in your strategy, so that you can reach your target audience on these social media channels. Once you have that down, the second step is to move your prospect into the next stage of the sales funnel. Why would you need a sales funnel? And what is that exactly?

[00:04:22.920] - Anca
First of all, let's define the sales funnel for a second. You can imagine it as an actual funnel where people go through different stages in their journey to get to where you want them to go. So, they start with the awareness where they become aware of your presence and they become aware of what you have to offer. They go through the interest phase, the desire, and then in the end, they take the actions that you want them to. Whether that's a sale, whether that's a newsletter subscription, whether that's whatever it is that you're offering.

[00:04:59.590] - Anca
Why are these important? Well, they can help you find prospects. They can help maximize the impact of your content and your message by matching your call to actions and your audience's level of interest. If someone's just learning about you, they will not sign up for the newsletter right away. They need to see that they're going to get value and that your content resonates with their values before they sign up for the newsletter, or even more before they purchase something.

[00:05:33.260] - Anca
So, you can focus your efforts into one of the stages or each of the stages, so that you can make sure that your audiences get the right message for the stage they're in. So, what's the role of social media in all of this, you ask? Well, you can think of it this way. It answers three major questions, the ones that you're seeing on your screen right now, and I think I'm going to make this smaller, so that you can actually see what's behind my image there. So, the questions are how do they find your social media accounts?

[00:06:12.960] - Anca
Well, they could do this by looking at hashtags. They could do this from listening to your podcast. They could do this from someone recommending your blog or your content or your social media. They can do this by finding your content in specific niche groups. On Facebook, for instance, there are several ways in which they can find out about you.

[00:06:35.740] - Anca
Then you can look at how you want them to think or feel about your business. Do you want them to view you as trendy? Do you want them to view you as lighthearted? Do you want them to see you as a professional. Placing yourself in the right aspect or the right state of mind for them is very important.

[00:06:58.310] - Anca
And then what action do you want them to take? Do you want them to sign up to your email list, buy an ebook, join a webinar, read the blog post, whatever it is, think about the actions that you want them to take and encourage those actions on your social media posts.

[00:07:21.640] - Anca
Sorry. So, let's talk about how we can approach social media strategically. And that's going to take about five steps, starting with number one, identifying your objectives. Here you can get as broad as you'd like. I want, as a blogger, I want 10,000 new blog visits in a year.

[00:07:47.620] - Anca
Right? I'm just throwing up a random number there. Okay, so I want to increase my blog traffic. I have my objective. Now let's go over to the second point, which is where I will pinpoint my goal.

[00:08:03.840] - Anca
And how do I do that? I get more specific with it. How do I measure increasing my blog traffic while looking at the analytics, looking at my social media, looking at everything, and seeing how I get from 1000 unique visitors per day to 10,000 unique visitors per day, let's say. The third step is to determine the key points or the KPIs that will help you in reaching that goal. So, now is where we get really specific and we say, okay, so if we're at 1000 and we want to get to 10,000, we're going to need 9000 unique visitors per day as an increase.

[00:08:50.430] - Anca
And how long would it take us to get there? Probably a year. Okay, so that way I know I need to gain 9000 unique visitors per day in a year's time and I can create work and I can create steps that can help me achieve that goal. Fourth and fifth steps are kind of interconnected because first you're going to look and lay out your content ideas and then you're going to plan that content ahead. So, let's see about laying out the content ideas.

[00:09:30.520] - Anca
First things first, let me introduce you to the concept of a content mix, which is where different types of content work for different areas of your business. So, you have educational content, you have motivational content, interactive content for engagement purposes, promotional content if you're selling things, curated content, so that you bring some authority from outside sources as well. Evergreen content, it's content that you can recycle and reuse every now and again.

[00:10:02.320] - Anca
And of course, because this is social media, you're also going to throw in some entertaining content, right? The purpose of having different types of content instead of just one is to avoid audience fatigue. Audience fatigue is when people see the same thing over and over again, they get bored. So, if they only see you promoting something, I don't know, let's say subscribe to my newsletter, subscribe to my newsletter, subscribe to my newsletter. On the fourth time, I'm going to ignore that noise or even unsubscribe.

[00:10:37.060] - Anca
Because I don't want to keep seeing the same thing over and over again on my feed. I've already seen that I need something new, I need something challenging, I need something entertaining, and so on. And so what you can do is mix and match with different types of content that you're using, so that you can create a balance with the types of content that you're using. And that way, prevent your audience from getting to that point, prevent them from reaching audience fatigue. And then once you have those categories laid out, the next step, and the final step also, is to plan your content.

[00:11:17.380] - Anca
This is where you will look at when your audience is online. Think about it this way, someone who's commuting to work back and forth and maybe has a nine to five job will be online typically during commute times because you know it's dead time. They might be online in the mornings, they might be online in the afternoons, but they will not most likely be online while they're at work. On the other hand, if you have a blog that's focused for stay-at-home mothers, you might have different patterns with the moms or the parents that stay at home and take care of their children because those audiences, they have a different routine. So, they might be online when the kid is at sleep or when they're at school, depending on how old they are, and so on.

[00:12:12.710] - Anca
So, really look at how and when your audience is online. On the second step is to look at the best time to publish for each platform and customizing your schedule based on that as well. So, you have some general best practices. You know, promotional content typically works best at around lunchtime, educational content in the morning, entertaining content in the evenings, and so on. But these are pretty general, so you can take the general things and combine them with the knowledge that you have about your specific audience and then reach the best times to post for that specific audience.

[00:12:57.330] - Anca
And of course, the third step here is to always test, adjust and repeat the process over and over again. Because consumer behaviors change, patterns change, people change, and so does your content. So, you have to constantly evolve with whatever else is going on, right? Good. So, when you're publishing content, it's always good to stay consistent. And how do you do that?

[00:13:26.440] - Anca
You plan ahead of course. But why is it important to stay consistent? Well, first of all, you avoid spamming. This is something that I see a lot and I'm sure you do too on Facebook and other platforms as well, where maybe it's a one person show and they don't really have the time to spend posting frequently on social media. So, whenever they do, they just dump 30 photos and 30 posts in there and you see them all and then they disappear for two months.

[00:13:59.220] - Anca
And that classifies as spamming content. Spamming your audience while still being active, because they will see a lot of content all of a sudden from you and then forget about you because you're not consistently there, top of mind. You can avoid this, of course, by staying consistent in your schedule, by creating a specific and consistent posting schedule, even if that only means posting once per week, but sticking to it. So, you can do this again by planning and scheduling your posts ahead.

[00:14:37.160] - Anca
One tip that I have for you is to use either the 80-20 rule or the 4-1-1 rule that I have laid out here. The 4-1-1 rule typically says that for every six posts you have, one should be a soft cell, one should be a hard sell, and the rest of four posts should either entertain, educate, or both. And you can take into account this specific rule regardless of how frequent you're posting. So, if you're posting once a day, that's six days worth of content. If you're posting once a week, that's six weeks worth of content.

[00:15:16.350] - Anca
If you're posting once per month, that's six months worth of content. So, you can really adjust it depending on how frequently you're posting. Now, let's look at how we can dive into these posts a little more in detail. First of all, the educational and entertaining posts, they can be a mix of different things. They can be a mix of your educating blog posts, YouTube, podcast.

[00:15:46.480] - Anca
They can be content that's curated from outside sources. They can be whatever it is that you need it to be. On the other hand, the soft sale might be a testimonial, it might be a review, it might be something like that. And the hard sell is promoting your actual business, so that it does stay top of mind to your audience.

[00:16:10.010] - Anca
Okay, we've gotten through quite a lot, but we still have some way to go. First of all, let's talk about how we can get the most out of the content that we've created. You typically work with a lot of blog content if you're a blogger, right? So, what you can do with that is to repurpose content that's not time sensitive, so that you can use it time and time again. This will maximize your traffic for that blog post.

[00:16:37.900] - Anca
It will help you save time because now you don't have to constantly think of new post ideas, but rather recycle the ones that you already have. And it will help bring your audiences more and more into your website.

[00:16:55.010] - Anca
You can repurpose your blog content in so many ways. So, let's start with one blog post as you can see here on the left. You'll see that one blog post is a source for some insights that can be turned into discussion points. And there can be several social media posts, by the way. It can be turned into quotes that again, you can spread in a lot of social media posts and use them as bite-sized, industry knowledge, or they can get used as thought leadership pieces, general info, personal opinions on a topic. So, depending on the blog post and what they're about, you can go for a lot of information there.

[00:17:40.810] - Anca
If it's a podcast, you can also turn that into a blog post first and then spread it out into multiple pieces or snippets of information. And with a podcast generally, if it also has a video as well. But even if it doesn't, you can get a lot more engagement by using it in reels and YouTube shorts and TikToks and encouraging people to listen to you, to look at you, to do all of that and make it more engaging that way. And then when you're posting on social media, you also have to follow the requirements for each platform, as I'm sure you know. Let's talk about the common structure of a post on any platform.

[00:18:23.710] - Anca
It typically includes a word count, sorry. An image size or a post format, which might be a feed post, story post, a reel, a tiktok, depending on the platform that you're on, and also the type of post that you're looking at, which, you know, some platforms, like TikTok, require videos, others might need carousels to work best, like Instagram, like LinkedIn, Facebook. They can go with linked previews and things like that.

[00:18:55.710] - Anca
Some of them work best with a lot of hashtags, others don't work with hashtags at all. So, take all of these elements into consideration when creating the structure of your posts. Now, if we're to compare a little bit, I just have two comparisons here. First one is Facebook versus Twitter, where the word count is extremely different. Facebook has a lot of characters.

[00:19:19.450] - Anca
You can really write novels. In the Facebook posts, you have 63,000 characters, whereas on Twitter, you only have 280 characters. So, you have to be really precise with your message. Even so, if you look at the ideal word count, you can see that Facebook ideally has 50 characters or less, which is content that you see above the fold, or content that is before the see more label comes in. On the other hand, because Twitter is so short, you can really maximize the use of your characters.

[00:19:59.810] - Anca
If we're looking at hashtags, you can see that Facebook doesn't really do hashtags. You can use them, but they don't make such a difference, at least not right now. Whereas on Twitter, around two hashtags per post really, really work. You can also look at the differences between the best times to post and the frequency as well, which is very different. On Facebook, it's ideal that you post at least once a day.

[00:20:26.220] - Anca
On Twitter, it's ideal that you post at least 15 times a day, and that's because tweets being so short and so many, you really have to retweet it and be there in the moment in order to see it properly. On a different note, we can see two seemingly very different platforms, LinkedIn and Instagram, which work in very similar ways. Right now, you can look at character limits which are pretty similar as well as the ideal character limits as well. You can see that both platforms use hashtags, even though the number of hashtags are different. And you can also see similarities in the posting frequencies as well as the best posting times.

[00:21:13.090] - Anca
So, don't think that just because the platforms are different or similar that they have the same best practices. As you can see in these two examples, LinkedIn and Instagram could not be further away from each other and yet the best practices are so close together, whereas Twitter and Facebook, they are the same idea, but they're very different in structure and how you can use your posts to maximize the views. Let's summarize a little bit on all of the things that we went through in today's session and see where we're at right now. So, my advice would be to concentrate on the platforms that are relevant to your audience and to your business. Use the social media channels that are available to you to move your prospects through your sales funnel that you first build.

[00:22:09.860] - Anca
Have a strategic approach to your social media posting, repurpose content that you have that is not time-sensitive, and create content that respects the requirements and best practices. Now, we've created all of this content. We've established a consistency, frequency to our content, and then we just drop it because sometimes it happens that we don't have the time to publish the content properly. So, what are we going to do in those situations? Well, here's a bonus tip.

[00:22:42.040] - Anca
You can use a social media management tool just like Social Bees, where you can actively include your content and share it across all of your platforms and make sure that your content is scheduled, that it's up to date, that it's ready to be seen by your audiences. If you're looking at my screen right now, you'll see our scheduling, our scheduling tool, I guess. This is where you schedule your content. And a little thing that sets socially apart is the fact that we do have a category-based system. So, if you're going back to the categories of content and the content type that I talked about a few slides ago, you can think of how you can create the different pillars of content in your strategy and include them in your SocialBee account.

[00:23:40.860] - Anca
And that way you don't have to constantly keep a calendar in front of your eyes just to see what the date for the third Monday of February is, so that you can schedule your content. You can just schedule your Motivation Monday category on Mondays, your Throwback Thursday on Thursdays, and then content in those categories will just get queued up and published at the right time whenever it is that they need to be published.

[00:24:10.990] - Anca
When we're talking about how you can create content in SocialBee, you can take advantage of so many tools, like the ability to customize your content for each profile, adding variations to your evergreen content, or content that's not time sensitive, and even to content that is time sensitive. For instance, I can create a countdown to a webinar or to an event by using the variations feature. I can also post my content at specific times or by just including it into the category of choice.

[00:24:41.190] - Anca
And I also have the ability to expire my content, so if it is time sensitive, I can make sure I don't have a Happy New Year post mid July. This is how the posts look in your categories in SocialBee, and they will go out as you schedule them, only if the content is set to approve. As you can see here, I have two posts in my screenshot, one that is approved, meaning it's ready to go out, and one that is set to draft mode, meaning I still have some work to do with that one before I send it out to my audience. If you stuck with me for this long and you are curious about SocialBee, we do have a special offer for you. So, thank you for sticking around so long.
