Hi, and welcome to the E-Mail Escape Plan, a minimalist approach to handling email chaos. A big thanks to Liz Stapleton for hosting this Bloggers Breakthrough Summit. I'm very excited to be returning speaker and to present to you how I get out of the email dark hole. So I have a question for you. Is your email a never-ending source of chaos? It doesn't matter how many times you try to create a system to be super organized. Do you always just feel like it ends up failing and you continually get tons and tons of emails that you need to sort through and have no idea how to do that? Here's the thing. You don't need to spend hours sorting emails to stay on top of things. My method is super simple, straightforward, and best of all, it works. Today, I'm going to show you how I escape overwhelm every day without using traditional methods like labels and categories. If you are ready to ditch the inbox chaos and regain control, I am so excited for us to dive in. But first, I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Yazzi from The High Vibe Biz, and I am a tech and automation specialist.

[00:01:32.020] - Yazzi Huerta
Some fun facts about me is that I am Mexican-American with dual citizenship, and I almost had triple citizenship because I was very close to getting my Australian citizenship, but we decided not to. I'm a nomad, and I spend most of my time throughout the year in Los Angeles, New York, and my favorite is our property in Mexico on the West Coast. I'm obsessed with helping entrepreneurs simplify and automate their businesses, their processes, and their funnels. I'm a former I'm a digital media director, so I used to work with many big brands like Honda North America, Mazda Australia, Dial Soap. And I've worked with a lot of smaller brands too, like Trevor Wine Estates, Wire Tourism, Calgary Golf, all over the spectrum. But one thing I find interesting is that it doesn't matter if you are a big wig working at a big company like that or if you're an entrepreneur like yourself. Email chaos is a real thing. And I cannot wait to show you how to save time with the email so that you have more time to do what you love. So my goal here today is to teach you how to save time and save mental clutter so that you can make a bigger impact, not only in your own personal life with your family's lives, but your local community and any social causes that you believe in that we really need out there.

[00:02:47.640] - Yazzi Huerta
Okay, this inbox is beautiful. I wish that my inbox could look like this. And this is just a random screenshot that I got on the internet, and it's beautiful. If I could maintain my inbox so that it was color-coded and perfectly labeled and just is beautiful to look at, I would be so happy. But the truth is that the methods to maintain an inbox like this is completely unsustainable. There are way too many labels that you can see here on the left-hand side. There's a little arrows next to these labels, which means that there's subnested labels as well. In order to do all this, you have to be on top of your email. You have to know all the ins and outs, and you have to spend time doing this. And I just couldn't do it. I believe that your email needs to be a source of ease. It shouldn't take you more time to organize your email than it does to actually read and take action on them. Because if you do spend a lot of that time doing this organization, I feel like you're going to hate your inbox. Because here's the thing about email, there's always going to be another one.

[00:03:54.310] - Yazzi Huerta
And one day you might be too tired and you don't do your organization, and And a few emails turn into 25 emails. And then soon enough, there's 100 emails in your inbox that you now have to organize and put labels on and everything. And then find the thousandth email, you're like, Okay, I'm done. I am no longer organizing this. I give up. And it's just too manageable. So a while back, I was listening to some NPR podcast. It was probably this American Life or Invisibelia, and it's literally years and years ago. But this podcast was It was all about how to get results faster. It was more unconventional because it wasn't about how to add things to ensure that things get done faster. It was about how you can remove something from a process and then get to your result faster. So one day when I was in this hole of adding labels to my inbox and organizing, categorizing them and everything, I decided excited that I wasn't going to listen to the gurus and all the classes I took about organizing your emails. I was going to start taking away. I realized I didn't need labels.

[00:05:14.730] - Yazzi Huerta
I didn't need subnested labels. I didn't need multiple inbox, which going back here, where it says unread, all zero action items, all waiting on everything else. Those are multiple inbox in your inbox. And I didn't need categories Categories. Categories are when my Google predefined what your email is. So is it a promo email? Is it something like, I didn't need all of that. So step one is to simplify your inbox. Trust me, I have tried all of the views. Gmail's default view with the different categories on top, multiple inboxes like I just showed you. But these tactics just didn't work because it was more work for me. I needed to simplify, and I'm sure you do, too. So here is what my inbox looks like now. It is plain and simple and legit. I think I have, since I started this presentation, I think I have four emails in my inbox right now, but most of the time it looks like this. If not, there's less than 10 emails in there, and I'll explain why. I do have two labels, and I'll explain why I have two labels now, but it is super simple to go through.

[00:06:21.940] - Yazzi Huerta
How I got here was first I went into my Gmail settings and I removed categories from my inbox. I was losing track of emails because Google kept auto-organizing things to social updates, forms, and promotions. The truth is that their tools to organize this information, I never found that it was accurate. I decided, You know what, Google, enough is enough. I get to decide what is an important email and what isn't an important email. I've unchecked promotions, unchecked social, unchecked updates and forums, and I only have one Inbox Now, which is primary. So these little tabs that you would see on top, gone. I also removed Enable reading pane because it just doesn't work for me, but you can add that if that works for you. It's not a big deal. But the whole point was to remove category stories from my inbox, and I stopped missing important emails because I no longer let Google decide what was important and what wasn't. Next, I went back into settings and then went into the labels tab, and I decided what I wanted to see in my menu. So you go back to the screenshot, here on the left-hand side, this is your menu, and you can decide what you get to see and what you don't want to see.

[00:07:41.520] - Yazzi Huerta
The first thing that I did was I hit all of the categories here. You can see that they're bold and black because that means that's the setting that it's currently on. Since I didn't like the way Google categorized my emails anyways, completely off. Next, I made sure that some labels were always seeing. So this included my sent folder, all mail folder, and trash. And lastly, I only wanted to see emails if there were unread emails in my schedule, my drafts, and my spam. And here's why. Because if there's no emails in them, then I don't need to see them. Easy, easy. But if there are emails in them, I do want to see them. Why would I want to keep this on for spam? I can't tell you how many times an email that I needed that was important and it up in spam. When I see that there's an email in spam, I can easily look at it and then decide if this is an important email or if it actually needs to be deleted. If it needs to be deleted, it's so fast to just select them and delete and then get them out of your mental clutter space.

[00:08:46.600] - Yazzi Huerta
They're just completely gone. Next, I turned off conversation view. If you go into settings in general in Gmail and you scroll down, you're going to see this on top, conversation view. So this groups your emails on the same topic. So eventually, if they have the same subject line, they're going to be grouped together. This was such a problem for me because every new email would remove the old email because it was all grouped into one. And it made it impossible for me to find my to-dos within the listed email. So as soon as I turned that off, that means every single email is its own email, I became so much more efficient and able to tackle my to-do So I turned those off, and I just feel like it's a way better clear view. And don't worry, you still have your thread inside the email, so you can look at things really quickly if you needed to. Step two. I love love. I would write a love song to keyboard shortcuts. You don't have to become this shortcut wizard or anything, but you just need to learn a few to zip through your email. And once you learn my favorites, you're just going to be amazed.

[00:09:59.370] - Yazzi Huerta
But before When you learn them, you need to do this first. Turn on the shortcuts. So go back to settings, go to general, and then scroll down to keyboard shortcuts and make sure to turn this on. And then once you've made all of your changes, click Save so that all of your changes have saved in your settings. Once you turn on your shortcuts, take a screenshot of my favorite shortcuts. So the top three that I recommend for you are E for archiving, S to star an email, and shift A to reply all in a new window. Those are the top three. I actually use all of these every single day, but those are the top three that I use consistently over and over and over again. And I would be a blob without them. I'll explain more why, e, for archiving. But G plus A, so g, a at the same time on your keyboard, it takes you to all of your email. J, once you're in your email and you're looking for things, but you want to go to the next unread email or the next email, just click J, and it will take you to the older conversations.

[00:11:05.160] - Yazzi Huerta
K takes it to the newer conversation. S to star an email, and then shift A to reply all in a new window. Sometimes I use S to star an email because it's really important and I never, ever want to forget it. And then shift A because I hate when I reply to an email and then it takes me all the way to the bottom of the email, and I can't even see what the person wrote to me to actually respond to the email. Having my reply pop up in a new window, game changer, much more efficient and effective. Love it. So now that you know how to archive an email using keyboard shortcuts, I want you to embrace the power of archiving. So I don't know if you've been sleeping on this, but archiving is amazing. Back in the day, when we used to send emails to each other, we had a limit on file size. Because we no longer send ginormous attachments to each other anymore, email has gotten so much better in terms of how it sends. It doesn't take a lot of file size. We can keep as many emails that we possibly want, and I absolutely do.

[00:12:12.080] - Yazzi Huerta
I just keep every single email that is sent to me. The only ones that I delete are spam emails. And now that I know this, I am confident that I will never, ever do something that is important, something that I worked with a client, we worked with somebody I've contracted with, I've hired with. And I will never, ever do something, an invoice, whatever else, because I'm just archiving, I'm not deleting anything. And once you know that you will never delete anything that is important, that mental clutter and stress just is completely removed. So I don't have to label anything, categorize them. It's just, Oh, it saved. It saved in my Gmail, and I don't have to worry about it. So stop labeling and embrace archiving. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're like, Okay, I'm archiving, but how do I actually find these emails that I need when I need them? You're going to become a pro at Gmail Search, and I bet you are already a pro at Gmail Search. They make it super easy for you to find your emails using their filtering system, which I love every day. But trust me, if you really need an email, you will find it, and it will be simple to find.

[00:13:26.410] - Yazzi Huerta
The ones from your students, your coaches, the things that you care you will find those emails. So the only time I haven't been able to find an email is because the email didn't exist forever. I just made it up. I would confuse it with something else, like a Facebook Messenger or somewhere. And second, it was because it was in a separate email inbox, because you have multiple businesses. I also have my personal email account with health stuff and whatever else. I just got confused. But I promise you, even if you couldn't find an email using this method, I doubt you'd be able to find the email using a super organized and labeled system because you would have to be super organized and spend all that time every single day organizing your system in order to find it. I just feel like that's such a huge timeline. It's like 15 to 30 minutes every day, labeling, organizing versus spending five minutes once every month or a few times a month to find an email. Step five, filter emails you don't need to see. This is a huge one. I have a project manager. I send all my emails that I are specific to-dos to ClickUp.

[00:14:33.610] - Yazzi Huerta
And once that email arrives in my inbox in Gmail, it is auto-archived. And I do this by using filters. A couple of examples. Squarespace sends me emails when I get a comment on my blog. So I don't want to see it in my inbox. I want to see it in ClickUp. So it automatically sends the ClickUp, and then it auto-archives in my inbox. The same with emails from Tidio. So Tidio is like [inaudible 00:14:58]. It's a messenger you put on your website and allows people to message you. So all those emails that I don't need to see that are actually to do is automatically get sent to ClickUp. Other emails, there are some that I just can't unsubscribe from because if I unsubscribe from those emails and I unsubscribed from other important emails from that tool or that creator. So instead, I create a filter that says unsubscribed emails from this specific person that says X, Y, and Z, either in the subject line or in the body of the the email. An example of this is Thrivecart sends me an email anytime if anyone has signed up to my affiliate program. But the thing is, I have a system that allows me to vet my affiliates.

[00:15:42.710] - Yazzi Huerta
So I approve them even before I get that email from Thrivecart. So it's a waste of space. I just don't need to see it, and I don't want to spend my time archiving it, even though it takes just a second. And just that second of freeness is super valuable for me. And so I automatically send those to Archive immediately, and I just create a filter to do that. All right, step six. Once you have your inbox looking fresh and clean and you set up your filters, it's time to take action on what's important. The first thing you need to remember is that you are the only one who knows what's important for you to see. You get to decide. You are the controller of your inbox. And I want you to be proud of that because you don't have to see anything you don't want to see. You don't have to reply to anything you don't want to reply to. Obviously, things that are important for your business you need to. So if you have a project manager tool, make sure that you send those emails to your project manager tool. Check if your tools have an extension so that you can easily add those emails that you need to take action on to your to-do list in your tool.

[00:16:52.820] - Yazzi Huerta
But be super clear on your boundaries. Not every email needs to be on your to-do list. So yes, sometimes emails have to take action on, but it doesn't require you to actually take action on it. I have a simple rule that I've just set up that if it requires more than 5 to 10 minutes of brain power that I actually have to focus and sit and respond. And it just goes to my project manager tool. I'll add it. But if I know I'm going to respond within that day, even though it takes 5 to 10 minutes, it just stays in my inbox and I'll respond directly and it's just done. It's not an actual to-do list that's going to take more than 10 minutes. So therefore it doesn't go into my ClickUp. So I just leave it in my inbox, and when I have time, I deal with it. But then there's other emails that come in and they're, I will want to read that email from such and such creator, but I just don't have time right now. And so I'll let it sit in my inbox for a few days. And if I get to it, I get to it.

[00:17:47.720] - Yazzi Huerta
But if I don't, and I'm really busy, I just let it go. I just decide to archive it. And if I have a chance, I will read it later. Because using the Google's Gmail search function I can find it again and it's not that big of a deal. You just have to be ruthless, and not even ruthless, but just be kind to yourself and realize that it's okay to not read every email and to let things go sometimes that are not going to impact your business negatively. All right. By this point, your inbox is streamlined, your labels and categories are minimized, and you're mastering shortcuts. But let's talk about the second to last step. Automation. There are emails that you will want quick access to or to write notes about or to categorize without cluttering up your inbox or creating additional labels. So I want to introduce Bookmark Magic. Bookmark Magic is a Chrome extension that I created, and it's like this personal assistant for saving and organizing important links, even emails, from your browser to a Google Sheet. And with one click, you can categorize to go exactly where you want it to go, whether it's your project management tool, like if your project management tool doesn't already have an extension that you can do this with, or you just want to send it to a Google Sheet so that you can write notes or remember things for later, or maybe you want to send an email to all of your Slack team.

[00:19:16.680] - Yazzi Huerta
Maybe you got an amazing testimonial from a student or a client, and you just wanted to share with everybody really quickly. Bookmark Magic allows you to do this without all of the stress, and it will save everything to where and if you want it to be saved. I feel like you'll never lose a link again. And it also gives you an opportunity to provide contacts to important emails or important links on the web. So when I use it through email, sometimes I get really good emails from creators, just great, fantastic emails. And I want to take it for later, but I don't want to put it into a folder in my Gmail because I actually want to write notes about it and why it was inspiring, what was just different about it. And so I use Bookmark Magic to write a few notes, and I saved the link, and I'm able to go back and see those emails in one place without any issue.

[00:20:04.660] - Yazzi Huerta
This way your productivity doesn't stall and you have everything right where you need it.

[00:20:09.520] - Yazzi Huerta
Step eight, make it yours.

[00:20:13.720] - Yazzi Huerta
So once you've worked with the system, you have to make it yours. Adjust the system so it fits your needs and your business's needs. I personally added two additional labels, one for courses and another for people who respond to my broadcast emails from Kit.com. I've then further customized these to automate information I need. When I add a course label to an email with course details, the email is sent to a ChatGPT assistant to pull out core data like creator name, course name, and logging URL. And that all gets added to ClickUp. Another way I use it is that if someone responds to my broadcast emails, I respond and add a label to the email that I send. This email triggers an automation within make. Com that will update the subscribers custom field engagement point. So essentially, it's this whole system that created. And this makes it easy for me to track who has actually engaged with my emails and who has it, which makes cleaning out my email list super easy. Other things that you should definitely do, too, is unsubscribe from any email list that you don't want to be involved with anymore.

[00:21:19.150] - Yazzi Huerta
That's the basics, but it's super, super helpful to keep on top of your email list.

[00:21:24.770] - Yazzi Huerta
I've learned that now that I'm using my one inbox method, I see every single email that comes through, and it's so much easier for me to discern which emails I just no longer need and can unsubscribe from. If you need a helpful tip on how to unsubscribe from emails as quickly as possible, use the search function to search for unsubscribed, and all of the emails that have an unsubscribed link will show up. You can just go through every single one using shortcuts to go through each individual email and then pricking the unsubscribed button. Just don't forget to review the new popup window that appears to unsubscribe, because that way you can confirm that you unsubscribed from that email list. I know so many people on my email list for my B2C business, they don't realize that there's an additional step. So just something to keep in mind if you didn't know that either. Another useful tip is to use the snooze button on emails. So maybe you need to take action on something, but you don't want to see it in your inbox. Maybe you want to see it at a later date in a couple of weeks, in a month, whatever.

[00:22:37.770] - Yazzi Huerta
You can go ahead and click on the snooze button on the right-hand side of an email within Gmail and it will ask you, how long do you want to snooze it for? When it's time, it will reappear in your inbox so that you can take action. I think for those of you who maybe don't use a project management tool, you're super on top of your things without a project manager tool, I think that's a super helpful way for you to continue to take action without cluttering your mind or your visual inbox.

[00:23:12.150] - Yazzi Huerta
All right, so let's just take a quick moment to recap. We've journeyed through a few steps to escape your email chaos from simplifying your inbox to automations your workflows with the Bookmark Magic. This isn't just about a cleaner inbox.
