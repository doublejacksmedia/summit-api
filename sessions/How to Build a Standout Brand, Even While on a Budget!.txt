Hello. And welcome to today's presentation where we are going to discuss how to build a standout brand even while on a budget. So, I hope you enjoy today's session. We're going to throw a lot of information at you, so make sure you have a tablet to take some notes and we'll get right into it. Alright.

[00:00:35.930] - Christie
So, my name is Christie Love Ettor, just to give you a quick introduction of who I am. And I'm an FD certified master marketer, Canva creator, and digital product creator. And, of course, my passion is branding and design made easy for the female Zylloprinora. I'm what you call multi-passionate. I love my senior Chihuahuas, and I run the gamut of doing fitness instructor, managing a contracting business with my husband for many years, as well as web design, and now I focus on branding.

[00:01:11.930] - Christie
So with that, let us get right into today's discussion. So, what we're going to cover today are the three things that you need first to create your brand. Now, I know it can be tempting to go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a logo design. But I want you to just pause for a second because before you even get to the design side of things, you need to do some research and set yourself up for success. So that's what we're going to do today. Alright.

[00:01:46.130] - Christie
Now, of course, the million dollar question, right? What is branding? Alright. So, very simply defined.

[00:01:53.570] - Christie
Branding is the process of creating a unique name, message and image in a consumer's mind. So, your brand not only includes the visual elements, but it also includes the typical things you think of, like logos, colors, fonts, and imagery. But then also the nonvisual elements, which we'll talk about more. And this is going to include things like your messaging, your niche, your values, and what you stand for. So, let's get into this where we're going to discuss these three things to create your brand, especially if you're starting out on a budget.

[00:02:33.350] - Christie
Alright.

[00:02:33.710] - Christie
So, number one and the first and most important, which is knowing your target market, knowing your audience. Alright. So, let's talk more about this because we need to have a starting point before we really start getting into our brand design. Okay. So what is your niche?

[00:02:56.870] - Christie
Do you even know who you're talking to, where you're going? So, you want to know your niche, at least in the broad sense. Right? You got to know at least have some idea of where your focus is going to be. It could be health and wellness, could be business coaches, educators, virtual assistants, and so on.

[00:03:19.610] - Christie
Right. So, you've really got to at least kind of have your category, so to speak, of who you're going to talk to. And we'll break this down with what is called a brand statement, sometimes referred to as a signature statement. And then you'll drill that down even more to who would be your ideal client. And then we'll go over the questions that you're going to need to answer in order to get to this, you know the nitty-gritty of this.

[00:03:50.090] - Christie
Alright. So let's move on to questions, questions to ask yourself first. So, feel free to screenshot this if you need to, write these down, and I will also go over in the next slide the actual formula for this. Okay.

[00:04:09.290] - Christie
So first question, who do you help? Next is why do you want to help them?

[00:04:17.750] - Christie
And what is it that you do, right? That would be good to know. And then how can you help them? Alright. So, we're going to use the answers to these questions to help write out our brand statements.

[00:04:34.310] - Christie
So let's see how we do that. Now, the basic brand statement formula goes like this. I help who, which is your target market with what, your service or product so that they can why, which is the transformation they're seeking through my how, and this is your process to achieve this. So I help who with what?

[00:05:01.910] - Christie
So that they can why, through my how.

[00:05:06.410] - Christie
So, we want to have this pretty well, you know down so that it's going to give you clarity, you know on so many things. And it's just going to make it so much easier to create your brand strategy. And this, in turn, is then going to help you to create the best visual elements that are going to represent your brand and help you connect to your audience. Alright. So, now, who is your ideal client?

[00:05:37.130] - Christie
So, there are five demographics I have listed here that you can, you know just take 15/20 minutes to think about. And you know start thinking about this avatar, so to speak, that you have or you want to reach. The first one is, you know your basic demographics like age, marital status, income level, occupation, gender, and so on. The next one would be what are their goals both personally and secular? This is really important because you know this is where you can find the people that are going to match the way that you can help them. Right?

[00:06:20.510] - Christie
So, number three is what are their values?

[00:06:22.550] - Christie
You know what do they stand for? Does it match with yours? Number four, what are their challenges, and what keeps them up at night? You know what is bothering them so much? What are their pain points?

[00:06:34.910] - Christie
Those are the things you want to think about. And then number five, where do they look for information? Are they looking online, on a blog? Do they watch TV? Listen to podcasts, you know have an idea of where you can find your audience or where they find information.

[00:06:55.710] - Christie
Alright. So, I have these two words here that are opposite, but you want to think about them, attract and repel. So, knowing the answers to the questions that we just went over is going to make it so much easier for you to find your ideal client because it's going to send the message of who is and who is not your ideal client. Right? So, your branding is either going to attract people to you or it's going to repel them in a good way, of course.

[00:07:28.890] - Christie
But you want to make sure that you're getting the right people to come to you. And then repelling the ones that are just, you know not going to be a good fit for you.

[00:07:43.050] - Christie
Alright. So, number two thing that we need to work on to create your brand is your brand personality. Like, what is that? Right. So, I'm glad you asked.

[00:07:55.590] - Christie
Alright. So what is a brand personality? It's something that just makes you you. It makes you unique. It's your essence or how you make your customer think and feel and react to your brand.

[00:08:10.410] - Christie
It's something that's not really tangible, but it has to do with that special, something that makes your brand unique and different. So, a few things that I'm talking about here are brand voice. And this would include the way that you speak, both in writing. And you know all your communication, just your communication style, basically. Then it would be your unique selling point, or USP, as it's often called. And then your personal story.

[00:08:44.590] - Christie
You know what kind of struggles have you been through that maybe others could relate to? And then a good question that you can ask yourself is, how do you want others to describe your brand? Okay. So that's, these are all going to help you to create that personality that's going to make you pop.

[00:09:06.250] - Christie
Alright. This is what I call my lemonade stand analogy. So, how can you stand out? Alright. So, there's three lemonade stands.

[00:09:18.190] - Christie
Right? We've got a kid who is you know excited to sell his lemonade. They all have the same ingredients, right. Three lemonade stands on the same street. Someone's going to buy that lemonade.

[00:09:31.510] - Christie
Right? Someone's going to come by in a hot day and say, I need some lemonade. But why should they buy yours? So, having a personal story, a unique selling point is going to help you to stand out. So, let's see an example of this.

[00:09:50.530] - Christie
Alright. This is Billy, and Billy knows how to stand out.

[00:09:58.030] - Christie
You look at the picture here, you know right away. It's so inviting. He's got lots of yellow going on. He's got matching eyeglasses and bow tie in yellow. And he's even added ice cream along with lemonade available at his stand.

[00:10:15.010] - Christie
So, I would say that's his unique selling point. So that's a good example of that. So, it's just very bright and inviting. Right. So this is what I mean when you want to find that special something that's going to make you stand out from the crowd, connect your audience.

[00:10:32.050] - Christie
But at the same time, stay true to who you are because you know, you don't want to just try to mold into what other people want. But you want to attract those people that are going to be the right fit for you.

[00:10:46.810] - Christie
Alright. So, here are some questions that you can ask yourself to find out what makes you different. Okay. You may think you're not that exciting or special or whatever, but everyone, you know we all have different taste. Right?

[00:11:04.690] - Christie
So the first thing is, what is your story? What is something that others may be able to relate with? I don't have kids, so I can't relate to moms. But I do have dogs.

[00:11:19.990] - Christie
I could easily relate to people that have dogs. So, what are things that you have experienced or you have you know in your life that others could relate to? Number two would be what sets you apart from your competitors, that would be your unique selling point. So, remember, with our example, Billy, he had lemonade, but he also had ice cream.

[00:11:42.790] - Christie
So, he had a little something extra, something that was different than all the other lemonade stands. The number three would be, what do you stand for or not stand for? Okay. So, you know you can have a strong opinion on something which is good and is great. And that is going to have the right people come to you because they're going to be like, oh, man, I agree.

[00:12:08.650] - Christie
I feel the same way. Number four would be how do you want others to describe your brand? A lot of ways to describe this. And I'm going to show you some examples of this in just a bit. So, this could be things like edgy, happy and bright, like silly, natural, athletic, you know just so many.

[00:12:28.510] - Christie
But you want to have an idea of the type of you know way that people coming to you would describe your brand. And then number five, who do you want to attract and who do you want to repel from your brand? So, think of it like, you know people are going to come to you that's attraction, that's a good thing. And then repel, like, repelling mosquitoes.

[00:12:55.210] - Christie
Not in a bad way, but it's like, okay, you know I don't want those. You know these are the ones that are really going to be able to help and relate to. Alright. Now, we finally made it to number three, which is matching the right visual elements. Okay.

[00:13:16.390] - Christie
So this is where everyone wants to go first, getting into the fun stuff. But the reason why, you know as you've seen, is there's a lot of work that goes into it first. So, what are your visual elements? There's a lot of things that come together with that. So, it's basically all the things that your potential customer comes or sees, and feels when they come to your brand.

[00:13:47.830] - Christie
This is the last part of the equation. And this is where you're going to marry those visual elements with your target audience and your brand personality that we just went over. Right? So, of course, logo design, avocon, submarks, color palette, your typography and fonts, and then various imagery, stock photos, elements, type of elements you're going to use in graphics in your design. So, this is all part of the visual elements.

[00:14:18.490] - Christie
Now we're going to break this down. And it's going to be a lot of information, but just take notes. And I will have a free guide for you that I'll talk to you about at the end as well, which is going to help you to have some examples as well and some resources that are really going to help you. Alright. So, first we have types of logos. Logos are fun. Right?

[00:14:45.130] - Christie
But there's also so many ways you can do it. So, we'll go over some of the types of logos here. First, we've got a stacked emblem and it's you know self explanatory. You've got an icon, leafy icon here, and Lady Jane, I like those old Victoria style movies.

[00:15:06.310] - Christie
So, Lady Jane Interiors. So, we have one font in all caps. And then underneath, we have a little cursive font under there, so that's a stack dumbbell. And then right beside it, it's similar, but it's called a side emblem because we put the icon there on the side.

[00:15:26.290] - Christie
So that gives it a little different look there. And you may want, you know depending on where you're using your logo, you may need to adjust it in some way. And we have a signature dual font. And that is basically using two different fonts for your logo. So, of course, we have this nice cursive look here for Lady Jane and then see more type print there.

[00:15:52.450] - Christie
Alright. Now we go down here where it's called a framed logo. And this is just a basic square with icon coming to the side. And there's a lot of different ways you could do it. But it's basically a framed look with the Lady Jane interiors there in the center.

[00:16:12.130] - Christie
Now we have a monogram or letter Mark. And this is a very I want to say plain, but it's not really the right word, simple logo, where it's basically the initials. So JC, actually, that should have been JF, but hey, you know there's no spelling bees here today. Alright.

[00:16:35.590] - Christie
So JC, and then Jane Seymour at the bottom. You could do it with just the initials or you could do it with both there as you see it here. So, it's really up to you and your taste. Circle logos are very good to have, especially for things like Instagram or other social media. So, you have that option there. We've got Lady Jane, LJ Interiors and the pretty little leaves on the side there. On the bottom left,

[00:17:08.950] - Christie
here, we have the signature font. And this is probably the easiest way to get started with your font is just to pick a script font. And it's basically just your signature there. And you can start as simple as that. Free form, this is a very stylized font as you can see this last one here.

[00:17:33.190] - Christie
We've got Lady Jane incursive, we got seymour Interiors underneath. And then as you can see, we have this little rose and the stem is creating the eye there in the center. So, it's very, you know this is going to be a much more stylized, takes a little bit more time to get the creative juices going for something like this. And then you've got your nice decorative line underneath. So, as you can see, a lot of leeway for creativity here. It's best to create two to three alternatives to your main logo, just because, as I said, depending on whether you're going to use it on your website, on you know some content, an email.

[00:18:17.630] - Christie
And you also want to have a black and white transparent PNG for each one, because sometimes you're going to need those for your content. Alright. So, there we have it. Now let's move along to color palette basics. Alright.

[00:18:37.370] - Christie
So, choosing your brand colors is more than just what colors look good together. But you also have to match those colors then to your brand personality, which we talked about a little bit earlier. So, we're just going to go over some basics first and then get a little bit more into the color. So, color is always fun. But you do want to have a little self-control, because your color palette shouldn't be more than four to five colors.

[00:19:06.890] - Christie
Your main color is the primary one, the one that you use the most. And then you have a secondary color and that's your supporting color. You can think of things like Coca Cola, you know that just have the red and white. Certain brands, you know, that those main colors. And then you have accent colors, and this is for contrast. I think maybe like buttons on a website, maybe certain headlines, things like that. Then you have a complementary color, which is a more toned-down color, often for backgrounds and things like that.

[00:19:41.510] - Christie
Alright.

[00:19:41.810] - Christie
On the right, we've got your types of colors categories. And we're going to break this down more in the next slide. But the warm colors are going to be a red, yellows and oranges on the color wheel. So, often associated with energy, brightness and action, like we saw with Billy, right? It's like it's a very you know, happy colors there. Now pool colors are going to be more, that's your purples, blues and greens. And that's going to give you more of a calming, relaxing feeling.

[00:20:16.070] - Christie
Then we have neutral colors, and this is going to be a browns, grays, black and white, and that's going to just tone down, get some balance to your other colors.

[00:20:29.550] - Christie
Alright. So, as I mentioned, we'll break this down just a little more just to learn a little bit of color psychology. There's a lot that goes into it, but it's good to at least have a basic understanding of color psychology. So, you can pick the right color palette for your brand. So, on the left.

[00:20:49.290] - Christie
Here, we've got our warm colors, which is red, your reds, yellows, and oranges. They're on the color wheel. Right. And this is going to be associated with words like energy, brightness, fun, happy, and passion. So, think about your brand as we going through these colors and think of where you might fall on the spectrum then we've got neutral colors.

[00:21:13.950] - Christie
This is browns, blacks, whites, grays. This is associated with words like integrity, innocence, elegance, timeless and conservative. So, again, you know I kind of think of like, minimalist type of brands when I think of these colors. Alright, cool colors is going to be your greens, blues, and violets on the color wheel. And these are associated with words like calming, wealth, eco friendly, like natural, spirituality, and luxury to name a few.

[00:21:53.430] - Christie
So, there you have it. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but it's just at least give you some basic, you know some basics there. Give you an idea of where you might you know start with your color palette. Alright. Now, types of fonts.

[00:22:12.630] - Christie
This is another wide open topic, but just like with colors, the fonts you use can impact how your customers perceive your business and the emotions that it evokes. So, we want to make sure we pick the right ones here. Now, as far as font scheme, a typical font includes two to three fonts. Do not use any more than that. You have your accent font, which is a very stylized font that's going to like both your personality, your brand personality, and then subtitle.

[00:22:49.650] - Christie
This is a slightly stylized font. It's typically used for headlines, but it's easy to read. So, you don't want it to be cursive or anything like that. And then you have your body font. And this is a font that generally has no styling. Alright.

[00:23:07.110] - Christie
When you think about body font, that's the content, the main content that people are reading. So, you want it to be easy to read. Alright. Font categories. We've got three main font categories.

[00:23:19.170] - Christie
You've got your Serif font. This is the fonts with feet or tags, and I'm going to show you some examples of these in the next slide. And this is good for headlines or subtitles, body copy in some cases depending on the font, but better for headlines and subtitles. I think they've got San serif, sans means without. So, of course, this font does not have the feet and tags, and that is best for body copy because you can, you know it's easy to read, easy on the eyes.

[00:23:51.930] - Christie
And then you have the script font. And this is going to be that more decorative font. It's very stylized, but you want to use it sparingly, because you don't want to have lines of this cursive font that people can't read. So you know, again, self-control is going to be good in this case. Alright? And what you might do is pick one San serif font and one serif font, and then one script, and that's usually a good rule of thumb.

[00:24:25.710] - Christie
Now let's break it down these different fonts, so you can see visually here what I'm talking about. So, the serif font is the one with a little feet or tag. It's usually still very easy to read. But you know depending on the font, you may not want to use it as your body font mostly for headlines. So, here, we have some examples.

[00:24:50.730] - Christie
Play Fair Display. That's one of my favorites, Prada, I love Prada. Arvo, Laura, Merryweather, Source, Serif Pro, so you can see they have the little like, at the bottom, these little lines, these feet like on the Rs and Fs. And it's just a little like curves or hooks most at the ends of the letters. Now, this font is going to be associated with words like dependable, reputable, reliable, and classic. So, just to give you an idea of matching this with your brand personality. San Serif, as mentioned, does not have the feet or tags, that's for copy because it's easy on the eyes. So, you can see the difference if you look at Play Fair Display and Pop and like, it's much.

[00:25:45.450] - Christie
I want to say cleaner, the cleaner font. It doesn't have the little tags at the bottom and the railway, Open Sans, Lato, just a few of these examples here. So, you can see when you compare the difference and why San Serif is really a good font to use for your body copy. Because it's going to be easy to read. People are not going to have to squint to read it. Alright.

[00:26:12.810] - Christie
Now, words associated with San Serif is minimal, clean, elegant, and contemporary, so very kind of like classy when you think about it. Alright. Now the stylized script, which everyone loves, of course. This is your more decorative font, often used for your logo, but you want to use it very sparingly, like as I mentioned for your headlines. So, when you compare the script fonts here to San serif and Serif, you can see there's a much bigger difference.

[00:26:48.930] - Christie
Right?

[00:26:49.410] 
You see a lot of loops and cursive just very stylized. You know this is obviously just a small sample. There are lots of options, but you can see why you want to use these sparingly because of that. Now the stylized is going to be associated with words like feminine, creative, friendly, natural.

[00:27:14.430] - Christie
It's just going to give some nice pop to your brand. And that's you know, that's a good thing. But you know as long as it is used in the right way.

[00:27:28.830] - Christie
Okay. Now let's get into imagery and elements, because this is really important part of your brand. Here are just some visual examples to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. On the left, we've got a very feminine and floral brand. You see the stock photo here with the pink flowers, the notepad, polka dots, and silhouette of a woman, pink hand-drawn flower. So, all the stock photo, the graphics, the colors, all put together, create this very feminine vibe right.

[00:28:12.390] - Christie
Now contrast that with one here in the center, which is more of an edgy and dark look. Just starting with the stock photo, you can see the woman here, she's wearing a darker color. She has the kind of edgy hair.

[00:28:31.230] - Christie
The coloring is just a little bit darker. And then we have these kind of square graphics here. It's kind of a geometric but kind of edgy look to it, streaky look. We got these little strokes here, this icon of a woman that's wearing black. So, all of this put together, as you can see, just kind of creates that dark, maybe moody, edgy vibe.

[00:28:58.170] - Christie
Okay. And then we have the third here on the right, which is even different, which is earthy and natural. So, when you have this kind of vibe, you're going to have a lot of green, bright look, browns, probably here. So, it's very calming. She's this woman sitting here out doing her exercise, and it's just you know very calming and the very Bohemian graphics here.

[00:29:30.090] - Christie
So, you know when you see these different brands, they each give you a different kind. They each have their own, like, tone and feel to them. Right? So, this is what I mean when you want to marry the right fonts, colors, and graphic elements, and imagery to your brand, because all of that put together is really going to make you stand out.

[00:29:58.630] - Christie
Now, remember, nothing is ever in stone. Your business is going to evolve, and you know you may need to make adjustments along the way, which is okay. So, just make a decision, pick the colors, fonts, all those things, and just go with it. Be consistent. And then if adjustments need to be made, you can always do that later.

[00:30:28.150] - Christie
Alright. So, just to recap, here are the three things to create your brand. The first one is knowing your target market and the things are going to help you are having a niche, or at least a, you know pretty good idea of what it is. Put a brand statement together and have an ideal client.

[00:30:49.030] - Christie
If you could drill it down, you know that's just going to really help you to really be more specific on your target market. Number two would be create your brand personality. So, thinking back to the lemonade stand, what's going to make you stand out? Why should I buy from you? Right? Number three is going to be your visual elements.

[00:31:11.650] - Christie
This is going to marry everything together. Right? This is going to bring it all together, match your colors, fonts, imagery, and graphic elements with your brand personality and your target market. But then remember, as I mentioned, nothing is set in stone because your brand and business is going to evolve, and really, you need just, you want to be consistent. You don't want to be changing the fonts and colors all the time. But if you do need me to make an adjustment because you realize. You know what

[00:31:44.230] - Christie
this isn't really fitting my brand, and that's okay. You know just go with the flow. Alright. Now, as I mentioned, I will have a free gift for you, which is my one, two, three, brand start up guide to branding your online business. So, in this free guide, you're going to have resources on some of the things we talked about today, like stock photography, logos, color palette, graphics, fonts, and you know more.

It has worksheets to help you answer questions about your brand and you know it's just really going to give you that, you know, that start you need to get thinking about everything. And it even has a list of 50 words to describe your brand or buy. So, it'll hopefully get the juices flowing and get you thinking about you know where you really want to take your brand.
