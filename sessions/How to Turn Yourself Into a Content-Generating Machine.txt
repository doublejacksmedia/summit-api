[00:00:13.430] - Speaker 1
Hi there. My name is Chris Lema. And for the next 20, maybe 30 minutes, I'd like to talk to you about what it's like, what it would be like for you to turn yourself into a content-generating machine. Everybody looks at that blank screen and feels the same pressure, feels the same stress by the time we're done, my hope for you is that you will have figured out through some of the frameworks I'm about to present how to get past that stress of I'm staring at a blank screen.

[00:00:50.950] - Speaker 1
I don't know what to write.

[00:00:51.730] - Speaker 1
I don't know if what I'm going to write is good enough or even staring at the screen where you've already finished writing something and you don't want to hit the publish button and you have that anxiety. Is anyone going to want this? Is anyone going to read this is anyone to share this?. We're going to try and get past all of that. And the good news is I can use all of my time because there is nothing fancy at the end.

[00:01:12.920] - Speaker 1
There is no pitch. There is nothing for me to sell you. The only thing you need is the frameworks I'm going to present to you in this presentation. So with that, let's get started. And the best way to get started is not to talk about how to become a content-generating machine.

[00:01:28.670] - Speaker 1
It's how to make sure that you don't kill yourself in the process, right? How to make sure that you are not making the most common mistakes that everybody seems to make. So let's hit those real quicks.

[00:01:44.430] 
The first is if you can only produce content when you're feeling something like when you're feeling motivated, we're going to have a problem, right? You're never going to turn yourself into a content-generating machine if you need that motivated, super excited, feeling. Athletes, exercise, and work out even if they don't feel like it.

[00:02:09.280] - Speaker 1
There are people I have friends that go running every day and they run even if it's raining outside. For me. If it's even cloudy and it looks like it might rain, I'll just stay inside. Motivation cannot be a part of the drive and the habit and the dynamic of producing content. So you got to get past that.

[00:02:26.940] 
The other one you got to get past is the I want to be super popular.

[00:02:30.290] - Speaker 1
I want to produce viral content. The results are not what you control. You control the process, you control the habit. You control the ability to get content published. What happens with that content is not up to you.

[00:02:45.880] - Speaker 1
And so you can't carry the weight of that. It has to be super popular. You can't carry that weight in terms of being motivated to publish your content. The other one is I know people who are like, I'm going to write the one and only Magnum opus. I'm going to write the critical final word on whatever the topic is and that's not what you want to do.

[00:03:11.900] - Speaker 1
You're not looking to create the complete The Ultimate. You've seen those titles all over the Internet, right. The ultimate guide to. First of all, let's be honest. Have you read any of those?

[00:03:22.660] - Speaker 1
Because most of us don't have time for the ultimate. We have enough time for, hey, here's a couple of quick hits, right. So we don't want to get stuck making that mistake, and we don't want to have to produce perfectly timeless content, right. If you're sitting in the world where you think, no, I'm going to put something in here and that's going to make it dated. It's.

[00:03:45.130] - Speaker 1
Okay. People are going to know that you didn't just write this yesterday and again today and again tomorrow. It was crafted in a moment in time. So let's not worry about Evergreen content forever. All right.

[00:03:58.300] - Speaker 1
We're just going to worry about what does it look like for us to consistently press, publish? And lastly, by now, you could have figured this one out, right? It's not about perfection. What we need to develop is the muscles and the habits and the approach to produce consistent content. Consistency does all the work for you.

[00:04:22.200] - Speaker 1
But you can't do that if you're going to make these mistakes, right? And so you don't want to get caught in them.

[00:04:30.910] - Speaker 1
That's what not to do. Right. And it's good because I'm positive that we could have spent all 30 minutes just talking about the no-nos, right? Because you've done it. I've done it.

[00:04:42.380] - Speaker 1
We've all done it. And it's easy to get caught in that trap. But we don't want to live there. Right. And so if we're going to talk about the consistent, continuous development of content, then there's really only one place to go.

[00:04:59.410] - Speaker 1
And I know you're going to be like, wait, what? And the answer is we got to go to Tyler Perry. So some of you may go, I don't know who Tyler Perry is. Who's Tyler Perry, right? He's the guy who did everything differently.

[00:05:12.110] - Speaker 1
And I mean, seriously differently. 1200 TV episodes, 24 plays, touring across the country, 22 films, ten TV shows, one book, and recently purchased a 330-acre studio. Atlanta, which is becoming kind of the second Hollywood in the US, is where he set himself up and has now a large enough studio to do anything, record anything and even help others come and record. But there are some things that Tyler Perry does that most people don't do. So you may not know this, but movies are expensive to make.

[00:05:54.000] - Speaker 1
And yet Tyler Perry, like 100 million, 200 million. Tyler Perry's movies cost about 20 million to produce. That's not a lot of money to produce a movie, and they regularly gross more than 50 million. Right. So he's not looking for 500 million.

[00:06:13.730] - Speaker 1
He's not looking to do kind of Marvel Universe, break the bank records. He's just like, let's just hit a good double hit another double, hit another double 50 million at the box office, another 5 million in DVDs and streaming video. And you go, would you invest 20 to get 55? Yeah. Every day.

[00:06:35.180] - Speaker 1
And so when you look at how many different movies you've done, right, you go. Okay. That's successful. But it's not just about the fact that he's wise with how he makes his investment. What's more important is that the average amount of time that it takes someone to produce or to write a screenplay is months and months and often multiple rewrites, and sometimes script doctors.

[00:07:01.090] - Speaker 1
They have to come in and redo it again after the rewrite. And his takes three weeks and has almost no rewrites, they literally produce any one of these 22 films with a three-week writing process, and then they're done. And if you thought, oh, well, that's because his movies are a certain style of no, no. Let's talk about his TV episodes, right? Most Hollywood Studios record one episode a week.

[00:07:28.810] - Speaker 1
He records three to four a week. Now. Part of that is because he has the process, the flow. He knows what he's doing. And I'm going to walk you through those frameworks for him.

[00:07:40.480] - Speaker 1
But the other part of it is he knows this is all a game of bats. So it's all about produce, produce, produce, publish, publish, published. That's the name of the game. So let's break down what he's doing, right. The first is he starts narrow with a very specific audience and grows from there.

[00:08:00.730] - Speaker 1
Sometimes we want to write the kind of perfect content that goes for everyone. And that's not helpful. It's also not a path towards success. So what you want to do if you're living in the Tyler Perry world is you want to start with a very narrow niche. For him, it was black Church, women, African Americans, not everybody else women, not everybody else, and people who have a Church background and not everybody else.

[00:08:28.020] - Speaker 1
That's fairly narrow. And this is why people were like, hey, he did all these plays. But then now that he has a movie, he doesn't have to do plays anymore. You're like, no. He kept doing the plays because it allowed him to stretch his audience to see how he could move from one audience to the next and see if the material works.

[00:08:47.030] - Speaker 1
We're going to talk about the feedback loops in a minute. But if you look at this chart, what you see is it starts with one group and then extends to all black families and eventually to non-black audiences. It is a consistent set of tweaking and adjusting and testing. When he took his little play troupe from the south up to the north, and now they're going to do the play there. In interviews, he said how he adjusts some of the words and test some of the languages to see.

[00:09:13.670] - Speaker 1
Okay. Would this fit better? Right. So you start with a narrow audience and then you grow it from there what's the second thing he does, right? Well, as I mentioned, he produces more content faster than everybody else, whether it's the three-week approach to writing his scripts or whether it's recording three or four episodes while others are recording only one, he knows he has to get stuff out.

[00:09:42.960] - Speaker 1
And he's again said in interviews, if I had to wait for perfection, if I had to wait until I felt like this is perfect, I wouldn't produce a thing yet. Most of us, as I mentioned earlier, we get caught in that whole thing of like, oh, this isn't right. This isn't great. Someone's going to have a problem with this one sentence, and then we hold back. It's how the pair doesn't do that just keeps producing, keeps getting at-bats.

[00:10:09.790] - Speaker 1
And then lastly, what Tyler Perry does is focus on feedback loops and feedback loops are the things you wouldn't have predicted for him. He had these plays and they were small, like, 4500 people, Max. And the way he would do the play was really ingenious. He would put 20 people in a chorus and put them in the play. Now, the whole benefit of putting 20 people in the chorus is that each one of those 20 then goes and invites family and friends to the show, come see me on my part.

[00:10:41.820] - Speaker 1
And so he got bigger audiences simply because of the way he crafted the narrative and the drama. But the point is he has these plays and he's testing material and he's understanding audience feedback. He's testing jokes. You can't do that in a movie, right? When you publish the movie, you produce it, you write it, you publish it and it goes out the door.

[00:11:02.960] - Speaker 1
You can go watch a screening. But there's no feedback loop in that. You're just literally going to see how it works. But in a play, it's live with an audience. And the more that you put yourself out there.

[00:11:14.330] - Speaker 1
And the more you collect that feedback, the more you can tweak it. And so the stuff that he learns and plays affects his movies. And then, of course, you get the feedback from the movies in terms of reviews that may affect his plays. And those feedback loops change the name of the game.

[00:11:32.210] - Speaker 1
There's nobody better at doing what I'm describing for you than Tyler Perry. It's why I use him as an example. And what I want to do is talk a little about the kind of in the same way we talked about mistakes. I want to talk a little for just a few minutes on then what do we do? We're not all Tyler Perry.

[00:11:49.310] - Speaker 1
We get that. But what does it mean for us? Right? And the first is you have to start developing a writing habit, a habit that is like, hey, I write every night after dinner or I write every day before dinner, or I write every day after I go for my morning run. People who have never run before, and want to start running.

[00:12:12.420] - Speaker 1
Most of the coaches that will get non-runners to become runners will talk about the habit of running. Put your shoes over by the door. When you get up. You normally have a coffee, right? Don't have the coffee until you go and take your run.

[00:12:27.630] - Speaker 1
Right. And so all of a sudden you start connecting chaining these habits. And it's easier to develop one new habit if it's connected to another habit that already exists. And so the same thing is true for you with writing, right? What you want to do is develop the habit of writing.

[00:12:44.870] - Speaker 1
The other thing is, I've said it before you got to take more at-bats. You just got to write more. You got to publish more. And the more you publish, the better you'll get at it, the more nuanced you'll become, the better you'll be able to take that feedback and adjust it into your new writing. But it won't work if you're writing one post a year or one post a quarter, even one post a month, you're going to have to get more and bats.

[00:13:12.110] - Speaker 1
The other is you got to get comfy with imperfect content, right? You got to get okay with content that is in your head. Maybe a B. You have no idea if the reader doesn't read it and go, oh, my God, there's an A-plus material. You can't judge someone else.

[00:13:31.550] - Speaker 1
You don't know how they're going to respond, but you can totally judge yourself. We've all lived there. And so what ends up happening is we go out if it's not perfect and I'm not publishing, you have to get comfortable pushing to publish, even when you know the content is not perfect, right? And you have to build your own feedback loops, right? You have to get to a place where you know how to test your own material.

[00:13:55.190] - Speaker 1
I normally talk about this in the same way that comedians test theirs. We watch comedians when they get on Netflix or they get on HBO or somewhere and you watch them and they do 45 minutes or they do an hour and a half of straight material and you're laughing the whole time. But that's not how the material was developed. They had to take each one of those jokes and each setup and they had to put it in front of people and suck. It was imperfect content, and they got comfortable with it.

[00:14:22.590] - Speaker 1
And then they started Pruning and Tweaking, and then they use that feedback loop to take certain jokes longer to cut other ones shorter. And then they start crafting their stuff. And the same thing happens for you and you're going to go, wait, wait. How? Well, it won't always be by writing a blog post, and we'll get to that in a second.

[00:14:40.820] - Speaker 1
But you have to create your own feedback loops. You have to let the audience inform content and then content inform the audience and go back and forth. All right. And maybe the biggest deal here is you have to get comfortable with disposable ideas, right? You have to get comfortable with the fact that just because you had a thought doesn't make it your best thought just because you had a thought doesn't make it a perfect thought.

[00:15:05.880] - Speaker 1
Just because you had a thought doesn't even make it the right thought. And most of us are like, wait, what are you talking about again, to comedians they know, oh, I have this set up for a joke, and by the time you end up hearing it, it's maybe 180 degrees different. Like, it's all morphed because you're not tied to the first iteration of the idea. I know when I start writing, sometimes I write something, and then I'm like, halfway through, I realized, no, this isn't going right.

[00:15:32.530] - Speaker 1
And I start tweaking it.

[00:15:33.540] - Speaker 1
And by the time I'm done, I'm like, wow, I literally just developed a completely different hypothesis than the one I thought I was writing about. So I know I've spent a whole lot of time 15 minutes talking to you, and I haven't shown you the framework. So the whole promise was to show you some frameworks to help you write faster. And the first thing I want to do is I want to talk about this disposable idea piece. Okay.

[00:15:56.220] - Speaker 1
So what's the point of today? I want to give you some frameworks to help you become a content-generating machine. And that's what we're going to look at. So let's look at the first one. It's all about feedback loops.

[00:16:10.920] - Speaker 1
And the way that I create a lot of material is that I start with a tweet. I start with just writing a sentence, two sentences, and I put it on Twitter, and I allow my audience to either say, but you forgot this. You missed this. What about this or yes. Plus plus, like like, heart heart retweet retweet.

[00:16:30.470] - Speaker 1
And it tells me, OOH, people are grooving with this. They like this. But also someone may say, Well, you forgot about this, and then I write them back in a tweet, and then they write back. And so we sit here in this loop of just tweet after tweet. Now I have some friends that I go hang out with on Thursdays, and I bring whatever has been interesting to those conversations.

[00:16:52.850] - Speaker 1
And so tweets turn into conversations or chats. And what's happening is as we're talking, it's reforming my ideas, which means I may go back and tweet again, like, hey, you never thought about it. This is my take, right? This is my new take, which may create a whole bunch more tweets and may drive to another conversation. Eventually, I'm going to take that material.

[00:17:14.240] - Speaker 1
I'm going to write a blog post. You know what happens the moment I write a blog post about it. People are going to want to talk about it, and people are going to want to tweet about it and they're going to go back and forth while you missed this. Or what about this? Or this is a great post.

[00:17:24.220] - Speaker 1
And so the whole time, these feedback loops are being generated in multiple different channels on Twitter, in person, and on a website. But then if I get enough feedback, I may bring this concept or idea into a talk where I'm on stage and performing. And when I do that, people are going to want to circle back and wait afterward and they're going to want to chat. And other people are going to tweet about the actual talk and this quote or whatever. And some people are going to write posts and review the talk that they were at the conference for and all of a sudden.

[00:17:57.410] - Speaker 1
Now my feedback loops get bigger. And then I take a concept that now I've refined further and I bring it into my coaching practice where I coach entrepreneurs and as we're coaching, they put it into practice, and we start figuring out ways to tweak things. And that means that I can finally turn it into a framework, and I bring that framework back to coaching customers. Sometimes I bring it into talks and I'll definitely write about them. And then those frameworks over time, as they get refined, become part of my overall worldview.

[00:18:28.510] - Speaker 1
By the time the idea gets to here, you better believe I strongly believe it. But when I started by writing it over here, it was loosely held right. I didn't want to hold on to it and say, this is my definitive answer. We have to get really comfortable with disposable ideas with the notion that I may change my mind. I may learn, I may grow these are good things, but all this part of this process also allows me to keep generating content so that's the first model, right.

[00:19:00.780] - Speaker 1
And it's a model of feedback loops that helps us turn out or create content. The other thing I want to tell you about is that most of us spend all of our time only writing content in the middle of the life cycle model of a reader. We presume that the reader knows a whole lot and knows our vocabulary and knows how to describe things. And we start from there. Yet you and I both have lived in a world often where we don't even know what to Google, right?

[00:19:31.920] - Speaker 1
Ever gone to Google? And you're like, I want to ask a question, but I have no idea what to write here. I don't know what the words are. It's because we don't know even the problem vocabulary. My wife and I had our kids who are now in high school.

[00:19:47.730] - Speaker 1
Our kids were little, and that meant that on our TV constantly, all there was children's television. And we said, let's go out on a date tonight and we got a babysitter. And then my wife said, I want to go watch a movie, right. But not one of those kid movies. And I said, sure, go pick it.

[00:20:02.780] - Speaker 1
So she goes on Google and she types new adult movies. Yeah. No, that's not going to show what you think it's going to show, right? Because in her head, she didn't connect that. Oh, that phrase means something.

[00:20:17.870] - Speaker 1
She was using solution vocabulary, but not for the solution she wanted. Right. And we have this problem where we don't know what to search for. And it turns out our customers don't know what to search for because they don't know how to describe their problem, much less describe a solution. And so the first thing I'll tell you is to stop writing content that starts when you think about your entire editorial calendar.

[00:20:42.300] - Speaker 1
Stop writing where it starts where people are solution aware. Start writing where they're completely unaware. Write the content that helps them develop problem vocabulary and then help them by developing solution vocabulary and then help them by showing them the options, which includes whatever you're offering and then how to choose between alternatives. And finally, why you're the best of the best. We normally start writing way too late.

[00:21:10.730] - Speaker 1
And it means that whoever was writing back here has developed trust with that audience, and they're going to go there before they come to us. And so our job is to go, oh, you know what? I need to actually think about writing to people who don't even know I exist and haven't even thought about this and don't know the words we use. If I was going to go buy a new boat, the only word I know is his boat. So if you're like, Well, what kind of boat do you want?

[00:21:35.680] - Speaker 1
I'm like one that goes on the water. I don't know what a deck boat is. And I don't know what a boatrider is. And if I saw a picture of a deck boat and a boatrider, they look so close to me that I think they're the same kind of boat. I don't have problem vocabulary or solution vocabulary, and it's your job to teach it to me and write articles that capture me so that by the time I become educated in the space, I trust you.

[00:22:00.630] - Speaker 1
You're the one that's been helping me, of course. And just because we're saying this is our goal doesn't mean that I have to write one kind of article. I can write lots of different kinds of articles. The real trick for us is to pick where I'm at in the life cycle model and then pick one of these types and say, Now let's bring these together and write it. And I know you're thinking, yeah, okay, cool framework.

[00:22:21.740] - Speaker 1
But how do I write all this? This is not easy stuff. Well, I'm not done. I want to show you a couple more frameworks, right? What I've done is take eight different kinds of posts, the kinds of posts that will likely be all the kind of stuff you're going to write about.

[00:22:39.430] - Speaker 1
Right. And these are not the subjects of it. These are the kind of posts you're writing. And so what I will tell you is there are some posts that our mindset. This is here's how you ought to think about this.

[00:22:54.820] - Speaker 1
And that's different than HowTo articles, which is problem-solving, which is different than Niche or spotlight. Look at someone who's doing something super cool, which may be like a case study. And then you have toolsets, which are these are the tools to use. And in every case, there's a framework for how do you fill in the blanks? How do you write this content faster?

[00:23:14.470] - Speaker 1
What you'll see is in a mindset I want to tell you. Hey, first, let me introduce you to this whole notion of what this mindset is about. I might name the mindset, and then I want to tell you, where does this apply? Right. Like, if you're in this situation here's how to think about this problem.

[00:23:30.940] - Speaker 1
And I want to start by telling you this is how most people think about it, and they're not correct. And then I want to give you the new frame. Here's a new way to think about it. And if you do, here are the results. You can see how this literally just tells you.

[00:23:46.900] - Speaker 1
Okay. I know what I need to put into this post to get a Mindset post completed. Well, we've all read HowTo articles. Right. And that's the here's the challenge you're facing.

[00:23:57.900] - Speaker 1
Here's what you're trying to get done or accomplished. Here are the tools you're going to need. Now let's walk through the specific steps. And then finally, here's the result. Here's the after, right.

[00:24:10.430] - Speaker 1
It's not hard, especially if you have multiple people writing content for you. You want them writing all using the same frame. And even if it's just you writing, you want every time you write another one of these to have something that becomes easier and easier over time. That's what these frames do for Niche or Spotlight. Hey, today I want to tell you about this discovery I made.

[00:24:32.700] - Speaker 1
I want to tell you how I found this person or this company and the backstory. And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to showcase I'm going to put a spotlight on them and tell you what they do and why it's so amazing. And then I'm going to give you the takeaways here's why this is important to you. And lastly, I want to encourage you to take action or to do something like what they've done. Then, of course, there are two sets.

[00:24:57.790] - Speaker 1
Right. These are the hey, if you're in this context, you've probably looked at all these other alternatives. I want to introduce you to a different approach than maybe you've used before, a different tool that you've used before. Here's my review and here's where to find it. And then the other four right.

[00:25:15.540] - Speaker 1
Promos. I know you're going to say but I don't want to pitch myself and you go, I get it right. I understand that. But one out of every eight posts isn't a lot of promotion, and at some point, you have to tell people what it is you do. So hey, here's the context that we found a lot of our customers in.

[00:25:33.370] - Speaker 1
And here's why we created the service or built the product that we did. Here's the problem it solves. Let me show you how it works. And here's why I want you to hire me or buy it.

[00:25:46.550] - Speaker 1
The last three are very similar in nature. How do we get more engagement? How do we drive growth? And how do we monetize now? You may say no, my customers don't need this, but I rarely find anyone who's writing content for anyone else who doesn't end up trying to help their audience grow in one way, shape or form.

[00:26:08.970] - Speaker 1
You may need one of these, or you may need all three of these, but what they basically do is they just reorder some of the same content here. And that is like, okay, what's your goal? And then these are the mistakes that you don't want to make. And here's how to evaluate where you are in your life cycle. And a strategy that given where you're at this strategy works.

[00:26:31.110] - Speaker 1
