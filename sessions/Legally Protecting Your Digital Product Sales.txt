Hi, guys. Welcome to this session on legally protecting your digital product sales for the 2025 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to be here sharing this information with you. In case we haven't met before, I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm actually the host of the summit, so you're going to be seeing a lot more of me this week. But when I'm I'm not hosting the summit. I also run a few other sites. I started out my online journey back in 2014 with a personal finance site because law school was not cheap. And eventually, I segued or started in addition to talking about the legal side of running an online business and blogging because I saw there was a lot of scaremongering happening in this area, and it's just uncalled for. It's not necessary. The legal stuff is super important but doesn't have to be scary or hard. I've been educating on the legal side of running an online business since 2017, 2018. So several years now I've spoken on it at in-person conferences as well as virtual summits, not just ones I run, but other people's too. So yeah, I'm a blogger, I'm an attorney, I'm the host of the summit, and I'm super excited to share this information with you.

[00:01:12.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This session is geared more towards advanced bloggers, but it doesn't mean you have to be advanced. It's always good to know and be aware of things that might come up later as you grow. So if you're watching this and you're newer, that's fine too. But I'm definitely excited to share this information with you, particularly if you are selling digital products. So Before we start, I do just want to encourage you to turn off your phone, close your other tabs, get rid of any distractions. As you will learn with this summit, each of the sessions are jam-packed. So to get the most out of it, you need to really pay attention. The sessions are generally short and sweet. I've kept mine to like 25 minutes max. Some of the others are a little longer, but I talk really quickly as well. You will want to pay attention to get the most out of this and take some notes. Before we start, I do have a little bit of a disclaimer. I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is not legal advice. I don't know your current circumstances, and chances are I'm not licensed where you live.

[00:02:04.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The information in this session is for informational and educational purposes only. I'm not responsible for what action or inaction you take based on what you learn. Again, informational, educational purposes only. It may be that you need to go see and speak to an attorney in your jurisdiction to help you figure out exactly what's going to be right for you. But with that disclaimer out of the way, let's go ahead and talk about what we're going to learn today. Like I said, legal stuff, super, super important. It does not need to be scary or hard. We're going to approach it from the fact that you are an awesome business owner and you care about your customers. And so you always want to be open and transparent. If that's the way you are, you're already halfway there. A lot of these laws exist because of people being shady. And so if you're not shady and you're just doing things openly, transparently, you're probably complying with a lot of things already. So let's first talk about what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Then we're going to touch on the basics of copyright and trademark.

[00:03:02.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Some of this I did cover in the intermediate session. If you watch that one, this is a bit of a repeat, but one new thing that I will be talking about is the new FTC rule on recurring subscriptions. At the time of recording this, I'm We're running this towards the end of 2024. It hasn't officially gone into effect. It should next month and completely by April 2025. However, it might face some legal challenges. So this is going to be based on the as it stands now, my understanding and what it looks like. And it may change a little bit, but I want to make sure everyone's aware of this. So let's go ahead and get started. Take a deep breath. Remember, like I said, it doesn't have to be scary or hard. We're awesome business people and we want to do right by our customers, so we're already halfway there. All right. So in case you didn't know, terms and conditions are your way of saying my house, my rules. They're basically the rules that you set for people to purchase from you. You see those signs that say no shirt, no shoes, no service.

[00:04:00.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Those are some of their terms and conditions. So your site, your rules. It lays out different things. Yes, it's who you serve and who you may choose to not. But also any refund policies you have, any payment policies you have, if they sign up for a subscription versus a split pay, and what is the refund policy for when and all that jazz, where if there's an issue, stuff has to be addressed, what jurisdiction. Limit your It's a liability because you can't guarantee they're going to get any one set result based on what they're purchasing. It's all those rules. It's all those things that are like, Hey, this is what you need to know before you buy from me. Like I said, it's another way to limit your liability because you're not perfect. Neither is your site, neither your products. Sometimes products of website will go down, and that happens, and you're not going to lose money because you didn't say that that might happen. You can't control every variable out there. You You don't want to get sued just because you didn't mention it. And then jurisdiction, like I said, you're going to decide where to throw down if any legal action does need to take place.

[00:05:09.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you are based in California, you don't want to go to Massachusetts. That's a long way to have to deal with that. So just keeping in mind, you get to choose that. It's your site, your rules. All right, so that's the basics of terms and conditions. If you're going to be selling digital products, you absolutely need them. If you're going to be selling physical products, same thing. But digital products, I feel like it can sometimes be overlooked, and it's something you shouldn't. Intellectual Property. Now, this is a very specialized area of law, and I am not specialized in that area. So if you decide to register a copyright or a trademark, I would suggest you need to go find an attorney that specializes in this area. You don't want a real estate attorney filing a trademark. It is such a specialized area of law. I'm going to talk about why in just a sec. So trademarks protect a brand's reputation and informs a customer what they're going to get. You know When you see the Nike swoosh, you're going to get a pretty solid shoe, might run a little narrow. But if you saw a Nike swoosh on a shoe that fell apart in a week, you'd be really confused.

[00:06:11.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A swoosh is a trademark, but there's also, I think, text marks. There's lots of different kinds of marks. If you think there's Dove Chocolate and Dove Soap, they're both Dove. But because they're such different products, there isn't any possibility of confusion. You're not going to confuse Dove Chocolate for Dove Soap. They can both be trademarked because different categories. This is why you really need to work with someone who specializes in trademarks if you want to file a trademark. Don't just ask your buddy that is a lawyer if they can do it for you. They really shouldn't agree to do it, but don't have them do it anyway. Because the whole categorization process, like I said, is very specialized, it's very tedious. And in order to successfully get your mark, you need to make sure you're doing it in the right category. If someone else doesn't already have that trademark, all that jazz. So just keep that in mind. It's not just the name, it's a category that matters, which is why you need to work with a trademark attorney if you're going to want to register one. But you might not register, so we'll get to that in a second.

[00:07:09.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Next up, copyright. The purpose of copyright is to protect what you've created from being stolen. If you created something, it's yours. If you wrote an article, someone can't just take it and paste it on their site because it's copyright-protected because you wrote it. Make sure on the flip side, you are being respectful of other people's copyright. If you're doing a roundup post or something, you can't just take someone's image and because you link to them, put it in your site. Attribution is not the same thing as permission. So if you are stealing someone's image, you're stealing someone's image, you're violating their copyright, don't do it. That being said, you don't have to register to claim copyright or trademark. It applies automatically. Trademark, you do have to be the first one with that mark. But you don't necessarily have to register. So you can use the trademark, you can use the copyright symbol. You You don't use the R symbol because that shows it's registered. There are some benefits to it being registered, one of the things is statutory damages. You don't necessarily have to prove that it hindered your business. You can I'm not going to say they stole it.

[00:08:15.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It was mine. Pay me money. It's a little more complicated than that. You do have to go to court. But one of the benefits of registering your copyright or your trademark is statutory damages. On the flip side, if you're not sure if you can use something, ask permission. Make sure you get it in writing so that you can reference it later if you need to. So that's all well and good. Stuff you create is yours to copyright. What about AI? So there's this case that took place in the US district Court of DC. And basically, It really stood on the ground of human authorship is a bedrock requirement for copyright. So what happened is this person made an AI tool in a generator and then tried to copyright the image his tool created and he lost. So here's where it stands. Whether the work is basically one of human authorship with the computer or AI, merely being an assisting instrument, or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work were actually conceived and executed not by the man, but by the machine. Are you using AI as an assistant or is AI doing all the work and you're just then slapping it up there?

[00:09:25.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's the difference. We're going to talk about a couple of examples. For example, if you give AI some keywords and ask it to write a blog post, if you take the content produced by the AI and publish the blog post, it's not going to be copyright protected because the computer wrote it, not you. Which means anyone could then copy it and put it on their site. And there's not a whole lot you could do because it's not copyright protected. You didn't create it. It doesn't have human authorship. It doesn't mean you can't use AI to help you write blog posts. It just means that you can't only use AI. You need to think of AI as an assistant if you want to be able to claim copyright. For example, I use AI on some of my sites to help spit out a super, duper rough draft. My goal is really to get words on a page so that I'm avoiding blank page syndrome. But then I go through multiple rounds of edits and formatting before I get to the final draft. In that example, a lot of the final content is of my own making.

[00:10:24.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm using AI as an assistant, so it should qualify for copyright protection. Images, things get a little messier. Again, there's the question of human authorship. Personally, I would not touch an image generator with a 10-foot pole. The reason being, and this is really, guys, my interpretation, this is my thoughts, is I think artists are going to have a much easier time proving infringement by the AI companies and using their artwork to train on. I've literally seen AI-generated images is that you can see a warped artist signature in the image. Machines can't pick up a paint brush. They can do ones and zeros in text. They can't pick up a paint brush. I think artists are going to have a much easier time proving infringement. That will mean that the future of AI image creation, this could be years and years down the road, but it's still not something I really want to mess with. Personally, I think the future of AI image creation is going to involve licensing deals. But my concern is if an AI company is found to have infringed on a visual artist's copyright, what does that mean for the image you created?

[00:11:35.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Will you be required to remove it? Are you going to be required to pay fee? We just don't know. That being said, that's where you're putting in a prompt and asking AI image generator to spit out an image. I would not do that. That's my personal preference. Maybe you're more comfortable with that. I think there's a lot more potential issues, especially with copyright. Of course, that image that it pops out is not going to be copyright protected. I think there's a lot more potential issues there. That being said, I think there's a lot of great AI editing tools for graphics that you own or have licensed to be able to remove a background or do things like that using AI in that way and assisting with the image that you own or have the proper license to use, I think it's fine. I think that's, again, falling into that being an assistant versus actually authoring the work. Okay, now let's get to this, Which has been in the headlines towards the end of... Like I said, I'm recording this at the end of 2024, but we're in January 2025 at the time we were watching this.

[00:12:39.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is a potential new FTC rule on recurring subscriptions. It should go into effect December, I think, 16th, or at least part of it, and then the rest should go to effect in April of 2025. That being said, there may be some legal challenges to it. There's a new administration, who knows if that will impact it at all. I'm going to go over this based on what the text of the final rule submitted to the federal register is, because I obviously can't see into the future to see what's going to happen between now and when you're watching this. Of course, I'm in the comments below. If there has been a big update, I'll be sure to, or if there's a big difference in what I'm presenting to what you guys are watching at the time, I will comment below. But let's go ahead and talk about it. What is the new rule? It's the Federal Trade Commission's Negative Option Rule. It's designed to ensure consumers understand what they are purchasing and allow them to cancel, type it there, but that's okay, their participation without undue burden. Negative options, which I feel like is a really strange term, is probably a little hard to understand.

[00:13:51.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To provide you some context, what this applies to are four different kinds of what they call negative option features. One is prenotification plans, which I really don't think applies to the online business space. But what it is, is when sellers provide notice offering goods, and then send and charge for those goods, only if the consumer doesn't take action. So if they're like, No, I don't want that, they won't get They're going to get charged. But otherwise, if they don't say anything, they didn't pay attention, they're going to get charged. So it doesn't really apply, I think, in this space. Another is continuity plans. So that's where a consumer agrees in advance to receive periodic shipments, which they continue to receive until they cancel. That could be something like FabFitFun comes to mind, like subscription boxes and things like that. That could also be potentially a membership. It just depends. A membership would actually qualify really well. An automatic renewal is the third one. So it's automatically renew consumer subscription when they expire unless consumers affirmatively cancel the subscription. So the way I... So again, that could be a membership. But if you, for example, they've signed up for 12 months of the membership, but it's a split pay.

[00:15:06.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They signed up for 12 months and they make monthly payments on it to pay that 12 months, and then it automatically renews for another 12 months. That would be an automatic renewal versus a continuity plan where it's just like you sign up for the monthly plan and it renews until you cancel, or you sign up for the annual plan and it renews annually until you cancel. It's just a little bit different. Then the final one which also you could see with trials, if you're doing like, lower cost trials or free trials, is the free to pay plan. So this is the fourth type of negative option feature, which is, again, weird language, but that's just how it's got. It's been renamed Recurring Subscriptions for the Rule. But basically, it's when a consumer receives goods for free for a trial period, after the trial, the seller automatically begins charging a fee unless consumers affirmably cancel. So like I said, examples of memberships. Other ones could be upsells, where you're using the previously given information to charge for one thing to charge for another. You have to make sure they clearly understand that additional upsell or bundled offers.

[00:16:11.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So what is required? This rule has gotten a lot of attention for it's like, Click to cancel aspect, but there's actually another part of it that is the clear and conspicuous disclosure and express informed consent. You need unambiguous affirmative to the negative option rule feature. In practice, what I think this is going to end up looking like is a checkmark required at checkout. So similar to how you have a check, I have to agree to the terms and conditions in order to buy, I think it's going to be a second checkmark where it be something like, you are agreeing to be charged X amount of dollars monthly until you take action to cancel the subscription before your next bill charge date. You may easily cancel the subscription by visiting, put the web page or whatever. So having an addition, so they'd have to check both of those in order to check out. That could be clear, unambiguous, unambiguous, affirmative consent to that, making sure they understand. There we go. So the next swing is the click to cancel. And what does that mean? So basically, and this is probably the most well-known part of this rule, is it has to be as easy to cancel as it was to sign up.

[00:17:27.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So the seller must provide a way to cancel through the medium the consumer used to consent. If they didn't have to talk to a chatbot in order to cancel, in order to sign up, they shouldn't have to talk to a chatbot in order to cancel. If they didn't sign up by sending an email, they shouldn't have to send an email to cancel. The cancelation mechanism must be easy to find when the consumer seeks to cancel, it's another bit. So that might mean putting it in your terms and conditions. Here's the link of how to cancel or whatever the case may be, or putting it in the footer of your website. So in practice, that might be what it looks like. So for example, I use Thrivecart. And so Thrivecart does have a customer hub that customers can access in order to manage their subscriptions. And I do utilize that feature. So that would work. Another one could be If they submit a form and then you have it all on your back-end, then it automatically will then cancel based on that form submission. It's got to be just as easy. And if they are able to automatically sign up, they shouldn't have to submit a form and wait for a manual approval cancel, especially if they might be charged again, depending on how quickly that happens.

[00:18:36.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You could put in your terms that you need to cancel within two or three business days. There's some room and flexibility there. But keep in mind, basically, it's got to be as easy to cancel as it was to sign up. All righty, so let's go ahead and review what we talked about in this session. We talked about what terms and conditions are, and hopefully you now know if you need them, why you don't necessarily have to file for copyright trademark, but again, that there are benefits to doing so. We also talked about the new FTC Recurring Subscription Rules, and what they mean in practice. We also talked about the importance of AI disclosures, and we didn't actually touch on BOI, but if you go back to the intermediate session, I cover that there. Basically, if you're a registered business in the US, then you need to file a BOI report with federal government. It's free. It takes 5, 10 minutes. Definitely go check out that session to learn more. Let's go ahead and talk about putting it all into action. You're likely going to want to include three pages on your site. You should have your privacy policy.

[00:19:33.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You should have your terms and conditions, especially if you're selling digital products, and a disclaimers page. So double-check, make sure that your policy pages have these things on there. And this checklist, I'll include a link below so that you're not… I mean, you can screenshot as well, whatever works for you. The default WordPress privacy policy does include some of these, but not all. So if you are working off of that, you probably want to upgrade. Terms and conditions page, this is what you should include. Again, I'll link to a checklist below. There's no default in WordPress for terms and conditions, but some digital product checkout softwares do include some. You might look at that as a starting point. Don't ever just copy and paste someone else's terms and conditions because that could be copyright infringement. It could also be not right for you. Some disclosures and disclaimers. You may need to include testimonials. Disclaimers are especially important if you're selling digital products and using testimonials. You can't I guarantee they're going to get the same results as those in the testimonial. So make sure you include that disclaimer. And again, there's no default. So first of all, I'm going to say that if you can afford it, the best option is always going to be to hire an attorney.

[00:20:45.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I'm saying that I'm not someone who offers these services. So I'm not like, Hire me. I'm not. That is always going to be your best option. If you aren't at the point where you can afford that, it's just too cost prohibitive, understandable, attorneys aren't cheap. Then the next best option is going to be to buy legal templates from an attorney that understands online business and blogging world. I, of course, am one. There's a lot of us, though. When I started, there weren't, but there are a lot out there. You might have some templates from various bundles and things that you can work together. Who knows? Alternatively, you can buy some. I sell some. This isn't a big old pitch for mine because I was very strict with what pitching is allowed in my summit sessions, and I'm going to abide by the same rules I put my speakers to. So I will say that I do love my templates. It's the Website Legal Templates Bundle is my most comprehensive bundle. I have a smaller bundle. If you are newer, called the Blogger Essentials Legal Templates Bundle, They both come with generators. I think they're great.

[00:21:46.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're awesome. Other people think they're great. They're awesome. I'm not going to read through all these. I'm just going to scroll quickly. And then just as a thank you for watching, I have a free gift for you called the Smart Bloggers Guide to the Legal Side of Blogging. So it goes over the stuff we talked about in here, as well as stuff I covered in the other sessions. And it's just a great reference guide because as an online business owner, you're wearing about 27 different hats. And it wouldn't surprise me if not all of this is immediately absorbed and remembered forever. I would understand it not being. So being able to access this reference, this guidebook, if you will, is a great way to go back and be like, wait a second, do I need to do something about this? So to redeem your free access, which you can do any point this week while the summit is live, go to elizabethstapleton.com/go/2025. I normally charge about $30 bucks for this thing, so I'm giving away for free this week, and hopefully you enjoyed it, and you got something out of this session. If you guys have questions, I am in the comments below, and this link is also below.

[00:22:51.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But that's all I have for you today. Like I said, short, sweet, to the point. I'll see you guys in the chat. I'll see you guys around the summit. I you are enjoying it and you enjoy the sessions. And have a great rest of your day.
