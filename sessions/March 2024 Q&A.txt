[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton 
All right, so we have a fantastic set of questions, and hopefully we'll get some more as we get started. I'm going to just make sure I have all the things muted. Nothing like a last minute change in tech.

[00:00:14.990] - Liz Wilcox
She's doing a great job.

[00:00:16.560] - Liz Stapleton 
How are you, Liz?

[00:00:18.100] - Liz Wilcox
I am so good. Thanks for having me. It's a little late, so my lighting is a little weird, my hair is a little weird, but my answers are going to be spot on, guys.

[00:00:28.440] - Liz Stapleton 
I'm excited I like it. I like it. We had Liz Theresa join us for a panel today, which she marks the fourth Liz. There are 4 Liz's in this summit, so it's a new record. I'm like, Yeah, I was like, I don't know, any other summit has this many Liz's. We're just special.

[00:00:48.930] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, I get to make a side note before we get started, I think that's a Liz Wilcox thing. I'm surrounded by Liz's always. In college, I had three friends, very close friends named Liz.

[00:01:02.550] - Liz Stapleton 
I did the same thing.

[00:01:03.870] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, really? And they all said, you're the only Liz I know. I'm like, really?

[00:01:07.860] - Liz Stapleton 
Yeah, no. Our little close-knit group, there was another Liz. There were two Liz's out of four in college. And then in law school, I was in a class. There was 20 people in the class. Four of us were named Liz. I was in another class that was five of us were named Liz, and it was 30 people. And it was like, which one of us are you calling on?

[00:01:28.450] - Liz Wilcox
Shout out to the '80s moms.

[00:01:31.860] - Liz Stapleton 
Maybe not so succinctly.

[00:01:35.160] - Liz Wilcox
Shout out to them.

[00:01:36.860] - Liz Stapleton 
For sure. Okay, so let's go ahead and dive in the questions, unless there's anything you want to say first.

[00:01:43.920] - Liz Wilcox
Should I introduce myself?

[00:01:45.430] - Liz Stapleton 
Yeah, maybe. I mean, I feel like you're so famous, you don't really need one. But go ahead. Well, thank you. I'll tell you- You are newer to the world in those. Yeah, yeah. Well, welcome.

[00:01:56.950] - Liz Wilcox
I'll take the compliment, but I try to stay humble. My name is Liz Wilcox. And you know that feeling you get when you attend an amazing summit like this one and there's some wild woman on the screen screaming about email marketing and how, Oh, for every dollar you spend, you can get $40 in return. Now go, go, go, go. So you open up your Convertkit or your active campaign, and then you feel slightly stupid because you have no idea what to write, how to get people to click, etc. Well, I'm Liz Wilcox, and I help eliminate that problem. I make email really, really simple for folks, especially bloggers, because I started out as a blogger myself. So can't wait to help you out tonight.

[00:02:44.040] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes. Okay, hold on. I'm just making sure. Okay, sorry. Someone was like, I can't see the video, and they're like, it works now. So okay, I was just making sure. Yay. Okay, so first question we've got is very, very specific. I bought It's our monthly subscription, but my question is, how do I get anyone to my blog to actually read it? That's where this blogging thing always goes wrong for me. I can write well, but I can't get anyone to click on a link to my blog. Would this require advertising? What do you recommend?

[00:03:15.880] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, so I just want to share really quick my methodology that I teach, and I think this will help everyone understand what we're talking about here. So just especially as bloggers, this is actually incredibly simple. Bloggers that listen to a lot of B2B email marketers, that advice is really hard for you to follow, especially like this person is asking, you just want to get people to click. Maybe you've got ads on your site, you've got affiliate links, etc. You're a blogger. We need people over to your website. This is what we're going to do in email. First, we've got a follower. Somebody reads our blog, they sign They sign up. Get them on your email list, turn them into a friend, and then you can turn them into a customer. Here's the thing. Friends click on other friends blogs, right? This is what we're going to talk about as far as how to get clicks. First of all, you need a proper welcome sequence. You need something to welcome people when they join your website or when they join your blog, whether it's, Hey, get this blog post for free, download it. I'll send it to you in an email, whatever.

[00:04:38.240] - Liz Wilcox
When they get on the email list, we need to welcome them properly. When we welcome them, This is what you're doing. Remember, you're taking them from follower to friend. If you never welcome them, it's really hard to become a friend. And so in your welcome sequence, you're going to put several links. You're probably going to send about three or four emails. These emails show off a little bit of personality. You're not the only garden blogger out there. Or maybe you have a blog about '90s pop culture or whatever. I had an RV travel blog back in the day. I was one of millions. I say with love, but you are not the only one out there. And especially with blogs, people tend to sign up for a certain niche or industry all at once. Maybe they were on Pinterest and they signed up for 10 freebies. We've got to make you stand out, and that's where you share a little bit of your personality. This is just surface level stuff. For example, Liz Wilcox loves the '90s. She's gone in N*sync, M&M, Seinfeld's hanging out over here. There's a record player in the background. I love to incorporate music and pop culture, especially the '90s.

[00:05:58.200] - Liz Wilcox
So that's going to help me stand It out. And then in your welcome sequence, you also want to share the vision you have. And you might think, Well, the vision is just read my dang blog. I need the ad revenue. But really, you have a vision. You're writing for a reason. Why are you writing this blog? Who are you trying to help? Share that directly in the welcome sequence. When you do these things, you might think, Liz, we're talking about clicks here. How is this helping me? But remember, we're trying to climb that email staircase. When they feel that, I don't know if emotional pull is the right word, but when they start to feel that connection with you, they're going to remember like, Oh, yeah, I did like reading that blog. Oh, yeah, Liz is the one for me. She's cheeky, and I know she really wants to help me get in my RV and travel full-time, because I've shared that in the welcome sequence. Also, within these three or four emails, you're going to put several links. I know, and this is why I I say most email marketers, you all, the advice does not work for bloggers, especially if you're a business to consumer blog.

[00:07:07.550] - Liz Wilcox
You're just talking to Joe Schmo. You're not talking to another business owner. We've got to put several links in our emails. And by several, I don't mean six or seven. I mean like two or three. Put a few in there. In that first email where you deliver on your freebie, your lead magnet, put that same link two times. Click here to access. Ps, don't forget, here's your link. People are skimming. We need to give them multiple opportunities to click that link. In another email, you might be setting expectations. Hey, I'm going to email you once a week. I'm going to offer you free and paid products, et cetera, et cetera. And then you link out to free and paid products. Like my this guy, like my that group thing. And make sure you've got those links. Now, we don't expect anyone to We might not even expect people to read our full blog post in that, but we want them to click. The higher the click rate in your welcome sequence emails, the higher it's going to be in your newsletters. You can also add a third welcome sequence email that is just your best content.

[00:08:20.150] - Liz Wilcox
Hey, Liz here. Don't forget, you signed up for this over here, and maybe you don't know me, so I just wanted to put my best foot forward. Here's my best blog post on how to convince your spouse to travel full-time in an RV with you. It'll make you laugh, and hopefully, it will give you some pointers. I'm creating a little bit of intrige. Do that, again, in the welcome sequence. We've got to get them clicking right away. We have to set the expectation. We have to train them that, Hey, I write emails, you click on them because they're valuable. And then we go into the newsletters, you continue to do similar things, and your click rate will go up. Yeah.

[00:09:08.220] - Liz Stapleton 
So the welcome sequence does so much. It does all you said, but also just confirms and reminds them that, yeah, you're in the right place. You found the right place to be, which hopefully people aren't getting on your list that shouldn't be there right. But that confirmation is, like you said, starting that emotional connection. And then I also wanted to say, don't underestimate a PS. They can really go... they're money.

[00:09:35.860] - Liz Wilcox
I'm so glad you brought that up. So as a blogger, what I did is I would just write a newsletter, give a little personal update. Hey, this is what's going on with me this week? If I had something special to promote, I put that there. And then in the PS, I would say, PS, here are your RV travel resources for the week. And I would put three links. Again, this is why I don't I like bloggers consuming a lot of B2B email marketing stuff because they always say one email, one job. I'm like, My people need variety. I'm business to consumer. Variety is the spice of life, baby. Some like salt, some like pepper. Then we got our Cinnamon Gals over here. And so in that PS, PS, here are your whatever resources for the week. You can put three blog posts. Click here if you're into X this week. Click here If you need to learn more about Y this week, are you on my YouTube? Click here. That's the third one. And so normally I would put two blog posts, and then a third one, I would put someone else's content. Product, whether it was a video, another blog post.

[00:10:47.930] - Liz Wilcox
And this establishes credibility. Liz is paying attention to the industry. She's doing that for me, so I only have to open her email. I don't have to spend all this time on Google et cetera, she's doing it for me. And also one of these can be an affiliate link. One of these could be a paid product of yours or someone else's. But every single week, I knew that people were scrolling, skimming. Oh, Liz, that's great. You're in Oklahoma, whatever. Where's my resources of the week? And then boom, my click rate, when I sold my blog, the email list was, I think, four years old and the click rate was at 12 %.

[00:11:28.900] - Liz Stapleton 
Oh, wow.

[00:11:29.600] - Liz Wilcox
I I don't know anyone else with stats like that. So the PS, here are your resources of the week, three links, sometimes four, if you've really got a lot to share, will work wonders, especially when coupled with that welcome sequence.

[00:11:44.810] - Liz Stapleton 
I was pretty proud of my average click rate of three %. I mean, some emails, it's like, especially soSummitme emails, the click rate goes way up. Okay, I like that. How do you balance promotional content with providing value in email newsletters? I feel like you touched on that a little bit, but I feel like some people are scared to send something that's purely promotional. And I think balancing the amount of promotion versus Yeah.

[00:12:16.100] - Liz Wilcox
So why do we not think of our promotional content as valuable? My paid products are the most valuable way I can help you. They are it, baby, as the cool kids. They are serving, as the Gen Z would say. I really want you to try to reframe it for yourself. Like, yeah, I'm promoting something, but I'm promoting the most valuable thing for my subscribers. And so as far as balance goes, hopefully that helps you open up to, maybe I could sell more. I I always say products are for serving, not for selling. And so when you write your promotional content from the fact of, Hey, you said this, or, You joined this email list because of XYZ, I have XYZ right here. Here's how it's going to help you. Here's who it's for, et cetera. Hopefully that helps you open up your mind about what promotional content really is. Then as far as a direct answer to how to balance promotion, I don't want to give you hives. I don't want to break your nervous system. Just start really small and build up from there as you open your mind. And the last thing I'll say, I mentioned it in that welcome sequence.

[00:13:46.190] - Liz Wilcox
This is especially important for bloggers. Oh my gosh. You have to set the expectation in the welcome sequence that you are a business. Raise your hand if you've ever seen a YouTuber or try to launch a course, and then two weeks later, it was gone and you know, dang well, they never sold anything again. That's because when you're on YouTube, the expectation is that you get paid with ads, I watch for free. So when a YouTuber tries to launch a course, open up their Patreon, Boo, eBegger, get a real job. That's not the expectation that they've set. And this is another reason to get people onto your email list because you can reset that expectation of, Hey, I'm going to offer you free and paid products, free and paid resources, services, whatever word you want to use. Imagine a switch back here and it just flips the switch to, Oh, Liz is a business. Shahar is a business. Nahaq is a business. They're going to offer me valuable promotions, valuable content. Really setting that expectation and then opening your mind to the fact that you're really going to serve and you're only going to put out products and promote other people's products that actually serve your ideal customer, boom.

[00:15:12.200] - Liz Wilcox
That's balanced to me.

[00:15:14.330] - Liz Stapleton 
I like it. It's a mindset thing. And I think it's something... No matter what background you come from when you start your own business, there's so many mindset shifts you have to make. I think email marketing, especially, and realizing the value of email marketing and that you own it, is definitely one of them.

[00:15:31.370] - Liz Wilcox
Amen. The last thing I'll say about that because email, I know it's emotional. It feels so cringy. You email. It takes five days to even gather up the courage to send the email. And then you immediately get an unsubscribed, and it's your cousin, and you're like, What did I do? It feels so... There are no words. But what I want you to know is that you  don't... Like, email feels emotional, probably because you have a bad idea of it, because most people do it really badly. Most people don't know the balance. Most people don't set expectations. Or giant companies just spam you with coupons every five days or every day, five times a day sometimes. Or maybe you came from a corporate background where email is the bane, the literal bane of your existence. If you didn't have to check your inbox, you might be able to get that project done on time. There's all this pent up gross energy around email. But I want you to know that you don't hate bad email. There are some emails you love to open. Some emails you're like, Oh, Thank goodness they sent me this. I would have forgotten.

[00:16:47.960] - Liz Wilcox
Or, Oh, great follow-up. Or, Oh, this lady's so funny. I love when she pops up in my inbox. You like good email. Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad emails. So don't worry Don't worry about unsubscribes. Don't worry about that emotional thing with practice that's going to go away. And just remind yourself, like Liz said, it can be emotional, it can feel hard, but just know with practice, you're going to get better at it.

[00:17:18.250] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes, I like it. Okay, and there's actually a lot happening in the email marketing world right now. Would you like to just quickly explain the whole Google deadline thing And then we talk about where email is going and this evolving.

[00:17:34.530] - Liz Wilcox
Let me button on my shirt, get professional here. I'm doing it, too. Got to stick to the bit, commit to the bit. So, yes, things are changing with email marketing. And again, this is for the better. All those bad emails you hate are going to be gone. And so the best way I can describe it is that there's three names that you're probably hearing. D-k-i-m, D-K-I-M, and then D-Mark, and then S-P-F. And you don't have to know. We don't want to go into super technical. I don't want you to glaze out and put a panic button on. But essentially, the Internet gods are telling you and me as bulk senders, we send one email to more than one person, that's a bulk send. They're telling bulk senders, Hey, you now need a driver's license to do that. And it's the exact same as when they invented cars. You bought a car, you got on the road. After enough people got on the road, we're like, Oh, this is dangerous. We need driver's licenses. That's exactly what is happening right now with Google and Yahoo. I'm sure Microsoft and all the others are going to follow very soon.

[00:18:54.550] - Liz Wilcox
And so essentially, you just need a driver's license. And in order to do that, there's lots of different resources out there. You can do it yourself or you can hire someone. I'm telling you right now, hiring someone right now is actually a really great idea because the demand isn't so high that the prices are relatively low. I want to caveat and say, Oh, well, Liz, I saw for $200, that doesn't seem low. When you think about any license for your business or for your car, your car needs insurance, You got to go to the DMV, et cetera. That costs money. This is just a cost of doing business. This isn't an investment. This is not an investment. Oh, I don't want... Should I buy that $200 course? Should I get the all access pass? Those are investments. This is an expense. Whether you pay or you spend a lot of time learning how to do it yourself, or you pay someone to just do it for you, this is a business expense. I highly recommend I'm getting it done right now. The deadline is February first. Yes, there are certain requirements that Google has published, and you might be thinking, Well, Liz, I heard you have to send 5,000 emails a day in order to get the red flag from the Internet gods.

[00:20:21.020] - Liz Wilcox
But Yahoo has not announced any requirements. They're just telling you, We now have new requirements that start February first. Microsoft has said nothing about it, so I do recommend doing it as soon as you can get that driver's license, get all three of those things authenticated, is the technical term. I say driver's license. And that way you're all set up. You're going to be able to email. You're going to get on the road free and clear. Nobody's pulling you over.

[00:20:53.390] - Liz Stapleton 
I have one comment and one question. First comment is 5,000 emails a day isn't that much. If you have a list of 5,000, you send one email, that's 5,000 emails. And 5,000, a list of 5,000 is not everyone has that. But even if you have a list of a thousand, if you're sending reminders, I'm sending upwards of four emails a day for the summit, right? Well, that's 4,000. It's not actually a big as a stretch as you would think. And throw in that you've got an automated welcome sequence sending emails. You can reach that pretty easily, even if you don't have a huge list.

[00:21:32.820] - Liz Wilcox
And it's the same as like, oh, well, I don't want to make this amount of money because then I'll have to worry about taxes. And it's like when you think, oh, I'm not at this number yet. I'm not going to get authenticated. If and when you, well, when your email list starts growing, you might start sweating like, oh, I can't, I got to delete people or I got to stop this because I'm not authenticated yet. So just get it out of the way, darling. I really... The simplest way, again, it's basically just a driver's license. And if you want to be on the road, you got to have a license or you're going to get pulled over. And that's exactly what's going to happen.

[00:22:14.470] - Liz Stapleton 
And that's where my question comes in. Driver's licenses, you have to renew. Is this something that's going to require renewing? Is this like an annually you need to go in and re-authenticate? Do you happen to know? Do we not know that yet?

[00:22:25.790] - Liz Wilcox
To my best knowledge, no. It's a one and done It's just, again, there's these Internet gods, right? And they're, do not pass go, do not collect $200. And that's the last thing I'll say about this is if you have or if you do not have these things authenticated, if you don't have your license, it's not that you're going to land in spam. That's not what this is. It's that your emails will not go anywhere. They will go like halfway to that first checkpoint, we'll say. There's a few checkpoints. This is technical. You can pull out the garage, but you're not going to be able to get on the road. Right. But they're immediately going to stop you. And so your emails will not even land in spam, in the promotions or the inbox. This is basically they're going to take your car away type of thing.

[00:23:21.910] - Liz Stapleton 
Okay. I like it. So given all these changes that are happening, how do you see... Do you foresee any trends or things we're going to start seeing more of? We're going to start seeing less of, hopefully, bad email right, because they're just not going to go. But what do you think we're going to see more of? What do you think is going to come out of it for those people that have a license?

[00:23:43.470] - Liz Wilcox
I'm so excited about 2024. Number one, the inbox is not going to be super crowded. I think this... Hang on, friends. Can I just pause and turn on my Do not disturb? Because my phone is blowing up for for some reason. Anyway, I'm excited about 2024. I think with less traffic on the road, we're going to be able to make more real connections. Something else that I think is this Boomerang effect in 2024 is AI. Last year, 2023 was, Oh my gosh, ChatGPT. Write a book in 30 seconds. Be a billionaire in one month with ChatGPT. A lot A lot of us started creating AI content, which is great. I'm not anti-AI. I think AI is amazing. It is 100% the future. But because there's going to be less junk in our inboxes, this is a great opportunity to actually write your own content. Or you can use ChatGPT, but edit it. Make sure it sounds like Jen, it sounds like Ricky, it sounds like me. That way, it really stands out because I think a lot of people, especially the bigger names who, Yeah, I've been authenticated for 10 years. This doesn't affect me at all.

[00:25:08.950] - Liz Wilcox
They also have money to AI the crap out of their business. And so I think For a little guy like you and me, we have a huge advantage to get authenticated and get in the inbox and be our real selves. And honestly, I haven't really talked about this much, but I think subconsciously somewhere in the brain, we do understand when we're reading or seeing AI content, and we make some signal in our brain when we're reading real content, like written by people.

[00:25:45.500] - Liz Stapleton 
That's connection in your brain.

[00:25:47.560] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. We don't get as numb to it. It's more engaging just naturally. I really think AI was over here, and I think we're going to slingshot it back to real connections. That's it's so important to get authenticated, because there's also going to be, again, less traffic, less drivers on the road. So people are going to see you loud and clear. It's going to be awesome.

[00:26:11.180] - Liz Stapleton 
Yeah. No. I think people are freaking out about this, but I think it's, like you said, for the better. Same thing happened in 2018 with GDPR. People freaked out. They're like, oh, my God, I'm not going to be able to grow my list anymore. And that's not the case at all. And it really it's just about being honest with people's data and making sure it's okay to email them. It was a good thing. And I think the same thing is going to apply here. Okay, so next question. What tactics have you found most effective in getting people on your email list to actively engage? I know this is something you're really good at, so I'm excited to hear your answer.

[00:26:46.790] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, thank you. Yeah, engagement is my thing. Once I honed in on that, I was like, Oh, it's over for everyone else. So you said that. So again, I want to take you back to the welcome sequence. If your welcome sequence doesn't get people to engage, your newsletters never will, and your sales emails will be marked as spam. Is that bold? That's bold. But you get what I'm saying. I love this story by Will Smith. He says, You don't try to build a wall. You just lay one brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid, and soon you'll have a wall. It's the same with engagement. You don't just decide to get your audience engaged. Send out an email that Liz Wilcock said, Oh, this got me the most engagement ever, and expect it to work. You've got to lay the first brick. Those first bricks are those first emails. Again, making sure you have multiple links to click on in those welcome sequences, making sure you are setting expectations. I'm going to email you every Tuesday. I'm going to offer you free and paid products like this, like that. I'm going to share my blog post and advice on XYZ.

[00:28:08.250] - Liz Wilcox
I'm going to be live over on YouTube for da da da. Set those expectations. That way people know know. The last thing I'll say is get replies in the welcome sequence. Replies are gold. There is nothing more weighted than a reply. In order to do that in the very first email, PS, like Liz's point, nothing works better than a PS. Ps, yes or no question. For example, I work with people, I want them to get their email together. So I ask, Do you already have a welcome sequence in place? Hit reply, yes or no. A simple yes or no will do. Be very explicit and clear. A simple yes or no will do. No shame, no judgment. If you're a gardener, do you currently have a garden in your backyard? Hit reply. Are you currently growing bulbs? Hit reply. It has to be a yes or no question. It has to be right here. I know the answer right here. It can't be a yes or no. Do you feel ready to da da da? I don't know how I I mean, I'm tired today, but when I signed up yesterday, I was feeling it.

[00:29:19.800] - Liz Wilcox
It can't be here in the brain. It has to be right here. As easy as, What is your name? We have to ask a question like that. I'm telling you, the more replies you get, the more open rate you're going to go up, your click rate, your sales rate, your engagement rate, your live show up rate, etc. Etc. If you can get those replies, it's over for all the competition.

[00:29:47.040] - Liz Stapleton 
I like that. I feel like I need to go review my welcome sequences, maybe add a question like that. So I don't think I have that in there. I do get replies, but it's not like... They're more open to the questions, so I don't get as many as I probably did.

[00:29:59.850] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, close-ended questions. Very simple. And then you can open it up later in your newsletters as you consistently... Then you can ask, oh, what's your number one struggle right now? Have you ever asked that? And have you ever had anyone answer? Or maybe you're the biggest fan and that's it. But we start, again, we start really, really small, and then we build up from there.

[00:30:23.950] - Liz Stapleton 
One email that I actually do get a lot of replies to, it's a product onboarding sequence. And I learned this from Kate Doster. But it's like 30 days after they've gotten the product, you just sent them an email, how's everything going with X? That's it. And so checking in, and people, you get a lot of responses like, thanks for asking, actually. Kind of fell off the bandwagon. And this remind me to get back on it. And it's like, seriously, a 10-word email. And I get a lot of responses to that.

[00:30:54.880] - Liz Wilcox
I love that so much. And remember, we're following the email staircase, right? We're trying to climb it. So a follow a friend customer. And note that Liz just said this is a product onboarding. So these are customers. With a customer, you can ask an open-ended question like that. With a follower, That's probably not even barely a friend. We have to ask those very close-ended questions. Yes or no, this or that.  Have you grown bulbs this year? This or that? Do you like the beach or mountains? If you're a travel blogger. Do you have a blog? Are you on WordPress or Squarespace? Very simple questions. As we climb up the staircase, we can ask those more complicated, deeper questions where we're going to get really good answers. But we've got to, again, lay that brick first. You got to take the first step before you're at the top of the staircase, right?

[00:32:00.280] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes, real quick, not email marketing related, but is the whole your ability to move the video, is that your Ecamm Live stuff?

[00:32:08.680] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, Ecamm Live, baby. Shout out to them.

[00:32:12.000] - Liz Stapleton 
I remember, I had Ecamm when I first started in 2014 because it was like, it connected to Skype and it let you record things. Because back then it was all about Skype, because I'm ancient in the online world. But yeah, and I was like, now I see you doing Ecamm, so I was like, I'm should've stuck with Ecamm.

[00:32:29.230] - Liz Wilcox
I need to get I love Ecamm. I've converted to Mac to use this software, guys. But I do so many presentations like that. It's easy to show people visually what I'm talking about. So.

[00:32:44.970] - Liz Stapleton 
Sorry, off topic, but I was like, is that what that is? Okay, so moving back into email marketing, what what key metrics do you think people should be tracking so they can measure the success of campaigns, broadcast in general, the language changes from platform to platform. But what key email marketing metrics are important to track?

[00:33:07.680] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, so it really depends on your goals. With bloggers, especially, of course, we got to get that click rate up. If we The very first question was, Liz, how do I get people to click? So that click rate is going to be really, really important, probably more important than anything else. How can we just get points 0.2% better every month. We're not going from 5 to 12%, right? We're going from half a % to 0.7% to 1, 1.2, etc. Just that's the That's the number one metric I would track as a blogger. But when it comes to metrics, I think of it as in three buckets. You've got your healthy bucket, and this is the technical stuff. How many people are Is your list growing? This is the main one in the bucket. Email is like water. If there's nothing flowing into it, it's going to get really stagnant. If you've had the same subscribers for the last six months, a year, year and a half, your email list probably stinks. You're probably like, Why do I even log in? Nobody ever does anything. Remember, email is like water. You got to get it flowing.

[00:34:27.730] - Liz Wilcox
How do we fix stagnant water? We put friends, fresh in. We don't try to clean the stagnant. We just put in fresh. That's the same. So this is your healthy bucket. Again, how many people are unsubscribing? Are your emails getting delivered? Which now we just talked about, it's going to be a no if you're not authenticated. Are people complaining? And list growth. But all these things don't stress. I mean, stress about the deliverability. You got to get that done nowadays. But the other two, people will unsubscribe. People will complain, as long as you're doing you and you're setting the expectations we talked about, you're going to be just fine. But really focusing on that list growth. The next bucket is the optimize button bucket. This is click rate and open rate. I already talked about it, especially for bloggers, we want to get our click rate as high as we possibly can. We've got ad revenue, we've got sponsors to check in with, all All that. Then, of course, you can pay attention to your open rate. What's a good open rate, Liz? I don't know. 1% better than whatever you've got right now. We always are just striving with the click rate, it's like 0.2. With open rate It's 1% better.

[00:35:47.090] - Liz Wilcox
How can I get 1% better in the next 30 days? How can I get what? And then just keep going. Then there's the me bucket. We've got the healthy bucket. I want to talk about list growth in that one. There's the optimize bucket. We really want to get our click rate up here. We want to optimize that. Then the me bucket. What matters to me? What is most important to my blog? Do I have a membership? Am I trying to create a membership? Then I need to focus on retention and probably list growth. If I sell courses, if I have sponsors, maybe revenue, cost per click or money made per click, etc. Then we talked about this engagement. If you're just starting out, I talked a lot about replies, and you're really not like, Well, I blog about this, but sometimes I blog about that, and I'm multi-passionate. You need to focus on engagement. You need to focus on those replies. That's not a metric that any email service provider can track for you. That first-party data is just something... Maybe you're a spreadsheet queen, or you just keep it in your head like, Oh, yeah, I'm getting replies every few days.

[00:37:01.000] - Liz Wilcox
This feels good. Oh, it's still happening. Oh, it's still happening. Oh, something happened. Let me figure that out. Because getting that engagement, getting those replies, maybe getting comments on your blog, Hey, I got this from your newsletter. That's I'm really going to help you hone in on, yes, okay, people like this about what I'm saying. I'm going to move more towards that. So again, it's that optimize bucket, the me bucket, and the health bucket. I can't hear you. You're muted. She's doing a great job.

[00:37:36.160] - Liz Stapleton 
I said, I feel like you need a bucket graphic because all what you just said is super solid.

[00:37:41.020] - Liz Wilcox
I do have a bucket graphic somewhere.

[00:37:45.300] - Liz Stapleton 
That's okay. You don't need to try to find it. I was just like, you should have that. That was super solid. Nice. I love it. Of course you got it.

[00:37:53.660] - Liz Wilcox
Healthy bucket, optimized bucket, me bucket. If you do presentations, get eCAMmm Live.

[00:38:01.940] - Liz Stapleton 
Shout out to your organizational skills and being able to pull that up so quickly. That was amazing.

[00:38:08.200] - Liz Wilcox
I do a lot of interviews, guys.

[00:38:11.220] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes, yes. And she does them oh, so well. Okay, so people struggle with, especially in the beginning, having to pay for an email marketing service. They're like, I'm not making any money. And we're like, hey, for every subscriber, you can make $40 or whatever, right How do you get people to see the return on investment that paying for email from the beginning... And some have free plans. I'm not saying you absolutely from the very beginning. But I would say start with what you intend to stick with, because switching platforms is incredibly difficult. So what would you say is, how do you get people to see the return on investment in email from early on and not waiting? Yeah.

[00:38:59.790] - Liz Wilcox
Linda, listen. I know it's so hard to spend money when you're just starting out. I come from a background of I didn't have any money to start. I didn't have any support. I'm not married now, but my then husband really did not like the idea of me doing this. He said, This is a scam, I was watching Ty Lopes' YouTube videos. He was very popular when I started. What's a funnel? A blog? This was before influencers were an accepted member of society. I really struggled. I'll tell you what I did. But I knew email was the thing. I'd watch the videos, everyone talking about a funnel, webinar. What I noticed, the pattern, was everyone is getting me on an email list. So that must be the actual key. Even people trying to sell me Instagram and Facebook groups were getting me on an email list. So I'm like, That must be the key. But again, I'd already spent $17 on hosting. It was like little stuff, but it was adding up. And so what I did is I found a free plugin. I use WordPress and collected email addresses. And I said, If I can get 100 people on this email list, then I can justify the cost.

[00:40:40.030] - Liz Wilcox
And that's how it worked in my brain. I got 100 people. Like, holy crap. I've got three people in my RV right now, and it feels like a crowd. A hundred people. I might as well been usher in Las Vegas last year. I was feeling like a superstar if I could get that. And so I worked really hard. It helped me dedicate myself, and it helped me go into Facebook groups, network, do this, do that, write the blog post, ask people to share it. And then within a couple of months, I got the hundred, and I went and I said, Okay, Convert kit, it's $29 a month, but I waste 20... That's a gallon gas or that's a tank.

[00:41:24.960] - Liz Stapleton 
Not a gallon gas anymore.

[00:41:26.190] - Liz Wilcox
It was. Not in America, thank Thank the Lord. But I was like, I blow $29. Surely I can budget $29 in my personal life because I really believe in the power of email. I just had to suspend belief and just believe that what they were saying is true. For every dollar, I can get $40 in return. I know I'm not going to get it right away. I live in the real world. I got to lay my bricks, right? But I know this many people can't be lying. And like Liz said, I knew I didn't want to switch platforms. I just picked one and I went with it. So if you need to give yourself a little goal to collect and then justify But really, I knew what everyone else was doing that was making money, it was email list. It might have looked like a webinar. It might have looked like social selling. It might have looked like Facebook ads. But what they were actually doing was building an email list and selling to me there. If I wanted to be a real business owner and prove all the people in my life who thought I was crazy wrong, I needed that.

[00:42:42.660] - Liz Wilcox
Again, it was more of just a business expense. It's not an investment. This is an expense. A course is an investment. A coach is an investment. Businesses have expenses, and we are blessed to live in a world where we don't have to have brick and mortar businesses. We can go online. Sometimes you've got to spend the money. I want to give you guys, I have a blog post that helps you pick out which one and they do talk about how much it costs, et cetera. I'm going to put it in the chat for Liz to put over on YouTube, and I've got one on email metrics, too.

[00:43:27.140] - Liz Stapleton 
I'll copy and paste those onto the page.

[00:43:31.080] - Liz Wilcox
It's an expense. I know expenses suck. Where are you blowing money that you can take, whether in your personal life or your business, and you can just spend it on an email platform that works? I'll say one last thing, I promise, and then I'll step on it.

[00:43:46.930] - Liz Stapleton 
You're fine.

[00:43:48.650] - Liz Wilcox
Please pick a platform. Of course, I don't want you to spend money you don't have, but please pick a platform that actually has features you need. There are some platforms, oh, lifetime deal, or it's free, but it doesn't allow you to set up a welcome sequence or tag people or have-

[00:44:10.160] - Liz Stapleton 
It Counts subscribers twice.

[00:44:12.360] - Liz Wilcox
Right. Basic features. That is going to make you hate email. I don't want you to hate email because I know it is the thing that is going to make your business real. It is the way you're going to connect with your customers and potential customers. And so I go with Convertkit. I see Liz is wearing a Convertkit T-shirt.

[00:44:35.930] - Liz Stapleton 
I have multiple, actually.

[00:44:38.080] - Liz Wilcox
I know they have a premium feature. I'm sure Liz has an affiliate link. You could check it out. But it's just enough features to make my non-techy brain, like figure it out. Anyway, that's my soapbox.

[00:44:52.860] - Liz Stapleton 
I do just want to say, when we started out, Convertkit's lowest plan was $29. We didn't really have a choice. They do have a free plan now. Now it doesn't include automations, but you can work around that if you really, really do not have, I think $9 is what it costs to add automations to like under the or whatever. It's affordable. If you really, really don't have it, one workaround is they have incentive emails, and so that can act as your welcome emails. Only one, it's not a sequence, which is really what's best. But if you are really strapped, you want to see if you can get to that before you invest the nine or $29 or whatever, depending on the features you need. And there's other platforms out there. I've been with ConvertKit. Oh, my God. I started ConvertKit in 2015. And before that, I tried MailerLite, I tried Aweber. I've seen the back end of active campaign. I think it's super powerful, but it's also super techy, I think. I tried Drip for a while. And again, it just It was more than I needed. And so of the ones... I always end up back end can work here because it always works the best for me.

[00:46:09.010] - Liz Stapleton 
And I've been just... I've quit trying to try to change things because that just slows down your progress so much. I was like, it's just the expense. It doesn't matter. So yeah, just keeping that in mind, you don't necessarily have to spend $29 a start. It could be zero. It could be nine. With Convertit, others may be completely free. But don't pick a plan based or a product based just on the cost. Look at, like Liz said, what features you need and try to pick with what you're going to stick with. Because it is a nightmare to change Because then you have to actually maintain both for a while because you've got the whole legalities of CANspam. And while if they unsubscribed from an old email that was on the other platform and they're still on the new one, it's a whole thing. But just really want to encourage you to pick whatever you're going to stick with, whether that's Convertkit, whether that's Flowdesk, whether that's whatever. I'm going to share this awesome article that Liz has that'll help you figure it out. In the meantime, if you are really struggling with what to send your email list, what week to week, you're just not sure, Liz Wilcox is your girl.

[00:47:18.790] - Liz Stapleton 
You want to tell them all about your amazing email marketing membership? I've been a member for two years now. And I'll be honest, I'm on the annual plan because I like all the other I don't usually have trouble coming up with stuff to talk about. I'm a Chatty Cathy. But on the weeks where I'm just like, I'm too tired. I can't... Yeah, I'll go and I'll grab a template. So why don't you tell them about it and then tell them about the offer you have for them?

[00:47:43.190] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, sure. So I think she's talking about my $9 a month membership. It's called email marketing membership. And every single week, you get a template to take and make your own. And what I love about bloggers joining is that I came came from a blogging background. And this is what I learned about what to put in your newsletters. And I talked a little bit about a framework, but you just need three things. If I can find where I am. Hang on. In your emails, and this is what every template is based on. Remember, we're climbing that email staircase. How do we turn someone into a friend? Number one, show that you are invested in them. Number two, share Share in a relatable way. And spoiler alert, this does not mean tell stories all over the place, especially for bloggers. That doesn't always work. Number three, stay top of mind. And this is the part that's really hard. It's like, oh, well, I got a million and one other things to do. How am I supposed to email once a week? Like Liz said, let me do it for you. And so every single template has you showing how you're invested in your reader, sharing in a relatable way.

[00:49:01.720] - Liz Wilcox
And of course, you send it out once a week, every other week. It's going to keep you top of mind. And so I think I've got a little, Here I am with it. Hey, check me out. See, I'm doing things. I'm going off script, guys. And so it also comes with a live Q&A, which actually, if you join tonight, the Q&A is tomorrow at 1:00 PM Eastern. Sometimes we go two hours. It's my favorite part of the membership because I get to hang out and be in your business with you for nine bucks a month. You can't beat it. It also comes with some list building and the email staircase training, like full on. That just comes with it. Again, It's just those weekly newsletters. What's so awesome about the newsletter is it's not just a template. I give you a video walkthrough to help you understand the marketing behind it. How are we showing we're invested? How is this It's being relatable, Liz? Then you get two examples written from two different business types. One might be, Oh, this is written by a garden blogger. The next one might be, Oh, this is written by a service provider.

[00:50:13.200] - Liz Wilcox
That way you can really see Oh, this style works for me, but that style doesn't. So you can really take everything and make it your own because that's what I really want for you. I want you to understand email marketing. I want you to write emails that feel good. That pass the AI test, that sound like you. And so I give you everything in the template to make sure it sounds just like you.

[00:50:41.190] - Liz Stapleton 
Yeah, it's fantastic because it's like, here's a skeleton. If you know how you want it to sound. And here's an example. And here's a little bit more explanation. There's levels for... I mean, how much energy do you have that day? Don't have any energy? Look at the swipe, make it your own. So it is fantastic.

[00:50:59.280] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah, and I I love it. You all, when you join, watch the video walk through, especially if you're new to marketing or you've been around and it's just not working the way you want to. These are three to five minute videos every single week, and they're basically like mini marketing lessons. You can apply this outside of email as well. It's just something I feel like I have to put in there because I want you to succeed. I want you to actually understand why you would send this so that one day you can fly from the nest. You don't need Liz Wilcox anymore. We actually said, if you cancel your membership and we ask why, and you say, Oh, I found my voice. I feel like I'm writing emails really well. We actually send you a gift because we're so excited that you feel like you've mastered email marketing. That's what the whole membership's about. So it's super, super awesome.

[00:51:59.510] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes, And if you join through the link that's in, I think Summit emails, it's on the page where this is airing, you can get a 30 day free trial. This is generously.

[00:52:10.600] - Liz Wilcox
Yes, guys. 30 day trial Please, find it out. We've got a lot of awesome, like I said, the Q&A. That's my daughter in the background. I don't know what she's doing, but she sounds like she just dropped something. Sorry, friends. Hang on. She said it's really important. The refrigerator broke? Okay, well, I'll be done in just a minute. You all, I'm versed. It's fine. I used to live in an RV with this kid while she was a toddler and do lives. Anyway, free trial. We've got the Q&A coming up next or tomorrow. You're going to get those list building. If you've got a list building problem, you're going to get that training. All this stuff, zero dollars. Try it out. Why not?

[00:53:02.400] - Liz Stapleton 
Yes. All right, Liz, thank you so much. I hope your refrigerator is okay.

[00:53:07.160] - Liz Wilcox
I think the door might have just fallen off. Oh, no, it was probably one of the little doorshelf. That's very good.

[00:53:14.370] - Liz Stapleton 
Oh, that's Yeah. All right. Liz, thank you so much. This was fantastic. Hopefully everyone got a lot out of it. The replay will be up. I will figure out a way to get it into the Facebook group since it was originally supposed to stream there. So it might be up a litte longer We'll see. So again, thank you so much. And guys, go check out Email Marketing Membership. It's fantastic.

[00:53:37.230] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. Thank you. Can I say one more thing? We got too many. I just want to say I'm so glad in this summit in particular, that that just happened with my daughter and that she won't stop making noise. Because you all, as bloggers, I feel like, especially when we first start out, we feel like we have to be perfect, especially if we want sponsors or we want a big list or We're looking at the Amy Porterfields of the world and everything's so perfect. I've been doing this a long time. Last year, my business made over half a million dollars, and the kid just walked off with a bowl of soap and water into my bedroom. You guys, you don't have to be perfect to make it work for you. Just please don't give up on yourself. Please keep going. Please keep laying those bricks. Stuff is going to happen. Refrigerators are going to break. You might feel embarrassed, but it's okay. Just keep going. I believe in you. I believe in your blog so much and your ability to grow it and make money. I can't wait to see what you do with email. Check me out.

[00:54:46.050] - Liz Wilcox
Zero dollars first month. I will see you guys later. Thanks, Liz.
