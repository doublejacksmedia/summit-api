All right, guys, I'm really excited for this presentation with Kayla from kaylasloan.com. She and I go back quite a ways. So, Kayla, thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:07.720] - Kayla Sloan
Well, thanks for

[00:00:08.510] - Kayla
Inviting me to be a participant, Liz. I'm really

[00:00:10.550] - Kayla
excited to join you.

[00:00:12.500] - Liz
Yeah, because, I mean, I met you years ago, and I've seen your business just skyrocket. Like you're doing well when I first met you, and now you're just like [inaudible 00:00:23]. 

[00:00:23.290] - Liz
So, 

[00:00:24.720] - Liz
thank you so much. Can you give everyone a little bit about your background and some of the highlights of what you're going to cover in the presentation?

[00:00:31.090] - Kayla
Absolutely,

[00:00:32.400] - Kayla
so, as Liz said, my name is Kayla Sloan, and I am the go to virtual assistant for the online personal finance space which is how I got my start in the online business world. And since then, I've actually graduated to teaching and coaching virtual assistants and also working with bloggers and business owners to help them set up systems so they can then fill them with highly trained and qualified virtual assistants from my training program.

[00:00:58.090] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:00:58.490] - Kayla
Excuse me. So I'll be talking a little bit in the presentation about how bloggers can take their blog from a hobby to a business by implementing systems that can be repeatable processes that they can then use virtual assistants to help them fulfill those duties.

[00:01:12.240] - Liz
Yeah, because I know when I started working with my virtual assistant it was -- and she actually had like assistant experience, and I did not really have experience working with an assistant. And so I was like, tell me what you need because I'm sure like this has been set up for me to do. And like, in my head, I know what I'm doing but I'm probably not doing a great job of explaining things to you. And whenever she's come back to me and it's not been like right on point, I'm like, well, I didn't do a good job explaining it. So, it's really always been my fault if something hasn't worked with my VA. But it is you get into these, you know, your zone and you're like, oh, it doesn't bother me that I just have to go find this or something.

[00:01:52.170] - Kayla
Right.

[00:01:52.440] - Liz
[crosstalk 00:01:52] but then you work to outsource, and then you end up just drowning in work.

[00:01:57.420] - Kayla
Exactly.

[00:01:57.650] - Liz
[crosstalk 00:01:57] So thank you for your presentation, you know, stuff I wish I had known -- and I'm still learning.  And so, let's go ahead and get to it.

[00:02:06.220] - Kayla
Hello and welcome to today's presentation. I'm so glad that you're here with me today, and I'm really excited to share the five simple steps to follow so you can successfully onboard a virtual assistant without stress to help you run your blog and truly turn it into a business. So, let's go ahead and get started. Okay. So as far as what you can expect from today's presentation, we are going to go over the step-by-step process I teach business owners to help them find their perfect virtual assistant. Then we'll also talk about the steps you need to follow in order to make sure you are prepared to hire and onboard a virtual assistant with success. Plus, I'll also share a few tips to help you outsource without the stress. Okay. So just a couple more notes here before we get started. So first, it's worth saying that following these steps to prepare and then successfully hire and onboard a virtual assistant is super important so that you don't end up wasting your time or money on hiring the wrong person. So many business owners I work with have hired the wrong person in the past, and they walk away thinking that: A, they don't need or want a virtual assistant; B, that virtual assistants don't work out well for them or their business in particular; or C, they are afraid of hiring a virtual assistant because it did not go well the first time around.

[00:03:26.740] - Kayla
But the truth is virtual assistants can help business owners and bloggers, like you, no matter what niche you work in you just have to know how to make the best use of your virtual assistant, which is something we'll also talk about today. Next here, in order to make sure you get the most out of our time together today, take a couple of seconds to silence your phone, close out of Facebook and other social media, shut the kids out of the room you're in et cetera so you can really focus, take notes and take action to get started today. And the reason I say that is because action takers are the ones who see the best results. So definitely don't put off on taking action on things we talk about today. Okay. So you're probably here and you're in the right place if one of these things applies to you. So first, you're already feeling way too busy in your business. Maybe you feel like things are falling through the cracks and not getting done. Or maybe you feel like things are mostly getting done, but not to the best of their ability because you're always in a rush or feeling behind and like you're pulled in a thousand different directions because of all the things you have to do to keep your successful blog up and running.

[00:04:32.660] - Kayla
Or maybe your deadlines are constantly going past due. No matter what it looks like the bottom line is you need help and fast. Or maybe it's number two, which is that you finally understand that in order to truly grow your blog and treat it like the business it is or could become, you have to hire some help. So that means you're ready to let go of some of that control in your business in order to hire help and watch it grow. Or maybe number three applies to you, and that is that you already know that you want to hire help and you're ready to do it but you just want to make sure you go about it the first time the right way around.

[00:05:11.480] - Kayla
Okay. So

[00:05:12.420] - Kayla
with that -- now, you may not be in the right place if you're not willing to let go of some of the little things and daily tasks in your business, even though you know they're holding you back from the big things. You're also not in the right place if you don't have a budget at all or you're not willing to pay someone to help you grow your blog. Or maybe you don't even see your blog as a business. Finally, you may not be in the right place if you are a hot mess and you don't even know what needs to be done day to day to run and grow your blog. Although I will say that if that last one is you, we can still talk later because we can still help you get that figured out. Okay. So here is a quick overview of the five steps to successfully hire and onboard a virtual assistant. Now, don't worry, we will talk about each one of these individually, so you don't have to hurry to write them all down. This is just a quick overview of where we're going. So first, the first step is to prepare yourself.

[00:06:08.660] - Kayla
Second, you need to take some time to prepare your business before you hire a virtual assistant. Third, you'll need to create a detailed job description. Fourth, you'll need to gather applicants and then interview those people. Fifth, you'll be ready to onboard your virtual assistant with a trial period or a test project. And we'll talk more specifics about that when we get there. Now, let's go ahead and dive into each one of these individually. So the first step in getting ready to onboard a virtual assistant is to make sure that you are prepared to do so. You, as the CEO of your blogging business, need to make sure that you're ready to take things to the next level when you start building a team. This is really important because the majority of bloggers have either not had any management experience, for example, from a part-time time job or a full-time job they've had in the past. Or maybe they aren't used to managing someone virtually which can be a very different experience from managing someone in person. So here's how you can get prepared to hire and onboard a virtual assistant in your business. Now, there's just a couple of steps here to make sure that you are personally prepared to hire, but they're really important to ensure a successful outcome.

[00:07:22.630] - Kayla
So here's what you need to do. First, you need to figure out exactly what it is you need. So, what tasks could you take off your plate? What skills are you looking for in a virtual assistant? Also, make sure to ask yourself whether or not you need to have specific things done at certain times or on specific days, or if you can be a little bit more flexible. Now, if you don't know the answers to these questions off the top of your head, you need to take some time to do a time and task audit to figure out what is taking up so much of your time and if it's something that could be done by someone else. Aka, it doesn't necessarily have to be you doing everything in your business. There are certainly some things that you have to do yourself things that take your particular likeness, for example, if you're the face of your business. So if that's the case, you'll need to do things like videos, interviews, photos, things like that yourself. But there are also plenty of things you don't have to do yourself, even if you are the face of your business. That can be things like writing blog posts, writing social media posts, responding to the majority of emails that come into your overflowing inbox, interacting on social media, creating blog post images, et cetera.

[00:08:34.810] - Kayla
All of those things are things done behind the scenes that can be done by someone else. Now, the bonus perk of doing a time and task audit is that you'll figure out exactly how long it takes you to do some of these things. So, if you end up outsourcing them, you should know about how long they'll take your virtual assistant and about how much it'll cost you if your virtual assistant charges hourly. Now, the second thing you need to do to get prepared to hire a virtual assistant is to make sure that you're aware of and know your own personality. So, for example, are you laid back or do you tend to micromanage things in your business? Or are you really friendly and outgoing? Or do you prefer not to be bothered when you're working? These personality traits will also affect who you'll want to work with in your business and who could be the best fit for you personally. Now, the third piece here is that you need to learn to let go and that can be easier said than done, for sure. But now is the time to prepare the expectation that you'll have to let go of some control and a part of your business in order to onboard a virtual assistant.

[00:09:40.270] - Kayla
Realize that the virtual assistant will have to do some things that you don't have the time and energy to do, but that they may not or probably won't do them the exact same way that you will. Unless you have an extremely detailed written out process, but even then, your virtual assistant may do things slightly differently than you would have done them yourself, and you have to be okay with that. Now, the truth is you can still demand very high-quality work and recognize that even then it may still be done slightly differently than you would have done it. It also comes back to that old saying that done is better than perfect. So, you have to recognize and know that that's going to have to be okay as you get ready to outsource and hire a virtual assistant. Okay. So time to take action here on this first step. So again, first, if you don't know what to outsource or you don't know the answer to the questions we talked about earlier, it's important to do a time audit to see what is taking up the biggest chunk of your time. After you see what's taking up all of your time, the second thing you need to do is to decide what you want to outsource first.

[00:10:45.810] - Kayla
Now, I will also say that that doesn't mean that you can't outsource some more of those things from your time audit later. Just go ahead and get started with one biggest headache or biggest pain point first after you do your time audit. Okay. So, after you're done getting yourself ready to hire a virtual assistant, now it's time to take a look at your blog to make sure everything is ready on that front as well. So first, if you don't already think of your blog as a business, you'll need to make sure that you tackle that mindset hurdle. If you don't, you may not feel ready to invest in hiring someone to help you grow your blog. You have to be ready to truly treat it like a business and see yourself as the CEO steering the ship in order to successfully onboard a virtual assistant. Okay. So, I will say that these things here are usually the things that bloggers and business owners skip over or decide is not all that important. But the truth is that these things are actually crucial to successfully hiring and onboarding a virtual assistant and making sure that they have their best chance of success with you as their client.

[00:11:50.960] - Kayla
Without this, hiring a Virtual Assistant may actually end up feeling like you have more work to do and more things to manage rather than taking things off your plate which is how it's supposed to feel, at least in the long term, after your virtual assistant is fully trained on your specific business processes. Okay. So, the first thing you need to do to prepare your blog is to make sure that you have processes created for all of your to-do's and tasks in your business. So, if you don't already have that, here's what you need to do. First, go ahead and write down everything you do and the steps that you have to take to do it. This is how you create processes for things in your blog. For example, how specifically do you write blog posts? How specifically do you get them published on your website? Write down step by step every single thing you have to do to publish -- to create and publish a blog post, for example. If you're hiring a brand new virtual assistant or if you have tasks that are highly skilled or important or highly detailed, I also highly suggest that you record a video of yourself completing them.

[00:12:57.200] - Kayla
And you can do that with a free resource like Loom. It's also going to be really important that you keep these written processes or videos up to date on a regular basis because we know things are constantly changing like social media algorithms. And maybe even something like your blog post publishing process may change after a significant Google algorithm update if your focus is on SEO rather than social. Keeping these things up to date doesn't have to be a giant chore either because it may be something that your virtual assistant can update on a semi-regular basis as those things change over time. Now, the second thing to do to prepare your business to hire a virtual assistant is to make sure that you have a project management system of some kind, and this is going to be really important. So first, get a system that you and your future virtual assistant can use to complete tasks on time. I personally use Asana, but there are plenty of other tools out there as well, such as Trello, Monday, ClickUp, and more. Now, these systems are going to be key to helping you track projects, deadlines, and all the moving pieces of each.

[00:14:01.070] - Kayla
And now that it's not just you doing things in your business, you need a system of organization so you can easily see what's being done by who and when. It'll also help you in case there are ever mistakes made or things that are forgotten and not done because it allows you to track these things and make improvements more easily, and you can also go back and see a history of tasks within your project management system. It also helps to greatly improve communication on your team, which brings me to this third one here, which is to get a communication system. Now, if you have an all-in-one project management system, you can definitely use that for communications as well. For example, my team mostly communicates via Asana comments and task descriptions. But you could also communicate with your virtual assistant via email, Slack, Voxer, or other options as well. My team, for example, does use Voxer for quick or urgent communications from time to time. Now, of course, deciding what is urgent or not is a whole other conversation for another time. Okay. So now it's time to take action here. So here are those three simple steps to prepare your business for a new virtual assistant.

[00:15:08.840] - Kayla
So first, you're going to want to create systems and processes if you haven't already. Those can be written, they can be created with videos, whatever makes the most sense for you, but go ahead and get those created ASAP. Second, you're going to want to set up that project management system, something like Asana, so that you can keep track of everything. And then third, set up a communication system for your team as well, if needed. Okay. So after you get everything set up from step number two, now it's time to create that perfect job description for your virtual assistant. Since you've already spent some time figuring out what you want to outsource, and maybe you even did a time and task audit, this first step should be pretty easy to do. So you're actually going to sit down, outline skills, possible tasks, how you plan to communicate, any certifications needed and whether or not your virtual assistant will need to know how to use your projects' management system or other tools, including your website's backend. For example, if your blog is on WordPress, then you'll need to list that in the job description as well. You'll want to be as detailed as possible to avoid getting applications that are not the right fit.

[00:16:16.470] - Kayla
So it's important to take some time here to make sure you outline everything you want them to do and all of the knowledge that you would require or at least prefer. The second thing you need to include in your job description is the pay, plus the hours or the scope of the project. So you want to list what you're willing to pay and the hours you'll offer, or if you're paying a set monthly fee or another project per project fee. This is important to help weed out virtual assistants who may have higher rates than your budget or don't have as much time as you require. Now, if you need availability at specific times of day or in a specific time zone or something like that, you'll want to specify that as well to make sure it's not a deal breaker for the virtual assistant you are hiring. Now, the third thing you need to do is to make sure that you offer your contact information as well as the best way for them to fill out the application and whether or not it's okay to contact you before you've made your hiring decision. As a special little bonus tip here, I always recommend that you add kind of a silly or menial requirement for applicants.

[00:17:18.610] - Kayla
This could be something like using a specific subject line when they email their application or pitch, or maybe you ask them to tell you their favorite color or favorite food as a PS on their email application. And the reason I say to do that is because this is something that just helps ensure that candidates are being thorough, detail oriented, and that they read your job description thoroughly as well. It'll also ensure that they have to make customizations to their application versus just copying and pasting and sending it off for over 100 virtual assistant openings they found online. Okay. So it's time to take action. So here is where you need to go ahead and take some time to sit down and create your job description. Second, you'll need to create an application form via a tool like Google Forms or Typeform or something like that to collect applications. If you don't want to collect applications on a form and instead you want people to just email you, make sure you set up a label or any special inbox or something like that to help you weed through those applications. And then finally, you need to go ahead and promote that opening with your social media channels through email marketing to your list, on your blog, et cetera,

[00:18:27.210] - Kayla
so you can start collecting applications and then go ahead and just let those roll on in until the deadline that you've decided to set. Okay. So after you've gotten at least a few applications, now it's time to do interviews. Now, interviews may feel like a hassle, or maybe they feel like a thing of the past, and you may be tempted to skip them and decide who to hire based just on their email or application, but I will say that this would be a mistake because part of hiring the right candidate is making sure that they are a fit overall, not that they just look good on paper. Okay. So here is more information about how to interview and get to know the applicants who have applied for your virtual assistant job. So the first thing you need to do is to make sure that you personally interview your top applicants. Now, I will stress that you should not wait until you are beyond your limit to get ready to hire someone because you won't want to go through this entire interviewing and hiring process when you're already stressed out. So, it's important that you take your time and interview the top three to six applicants that seem like the best fit for you.

[00:19:34.260] - Kayla
And you should do these interviews personally, not have someone else do that for you. Now, these interviews don't have to be super long. They can be 30 minutes or less each for an interview. But doing these personally will help you to make sure that the virtual assistants who are applying are a good fit for you. Now, the second piece here during the interview process is that you want to make sure that you actually get to know these candidates. Because you don't want to clash with your future virtual assistant, it's important to make sure that their personality and goals fit in with yours. After all, they'll be helping you in your business, so you definitely want to make sure that you get along. So take a few minutes of that 30-minute interview to get to know them on a more personal level by talking about more than just business. Okay. So, now, your action steps include reviewing the applications and narrowing them down to the top three to six applicants. I would suggest that you look closely for a virtual assistant who is detail-oriented, a good communicator and leaves thorough and thoughtful responses to your application questions.

[00:20:35.730] - Kayla
Then go ahead and set up interviews with each of those top candidates, and definitely take notes during each interview so you can review them all afterwards when making a decision, which brings us to step number five. After the interviews, it's definitely time to make a decision and hire someone, at least for a test project or trial period to start with. In fact, sometimes business owners I've worked with will actually hire the top two candidates for a test project or a trial period to see which ends up performing better and/or fitting in better with the business, and that's okay. Just make sure you plan in your budget so you can pay for the test project or trial period for both virtual assistant candidates because you should never ask an applicant to do unpaid work. Okay. So the actual onboarding process after you've gone through interviews is actually pretty simple. So, the first thing you need to do is to either create a contract or sign a contract from your virtual assistant. Most virtual assistants will actually have their own contracts that they can provide to you, but you may want to have them sign one of yours if you have one.

[00:21:42.710] - Kayla
If they have the contract and provide it to you, make sure that you read all of the details before you sign on the dotted line. If you have questions, it may even be worth having a lawyer read over the contract before you sign it. To make things as easy as possible, you can use an electronic signing service like DocuSign or HelloSign to sign a contract. The next step in onboarding your virtual assistant is to make sure that you create shared folders. So for any work that needs to be uploaded and shared with each other or sent to each other, you'll need to have some shared folders in place such as in Google Drive or Dropbox or something like that. Or you need to be using a project management system that allows uploading and storage capabilities such as Asana. And this is something that will help you keep everything organized. And you'll want to make sure that using these means that you'll own everything that is created for your business. So basically, all intellectual property that is created on behalf of your business should be owned by you, and that should also be spelled out in the contract with your virtual assistant as well.

[00:22:44.680] - Kayla
That way you don't have to replace everything or create it from scratch if your virtual assistant doesn't work out in the long term. Now, the next thing you need to do is to create an email or a contact address for your virtual assistant. This is going to be especially important if your virtual assistant will be conducting business on your behalf, sending emails, reaching out to people, things like that. So you can go ahead and just create a team email address for your virtual assistant, or you can actually create an email address with their specific name followed by your businessname.com. Now, you can also use this email address to add your virtual assistant to shared folders and the project management system so they aren't using their personal email address or account to access your secure information. You can also use the email you create to share passwords and login information with your virtual assistant through a tool like LastPass. Now, the next thing to do is to train your virtual assistant. So, once you've hired your virtual assistant, you definitely need to have them go through the training videos or tasks or written procedures that you've created and have them go through those as a trial.

[00:23:51.000] - Kayla
You can set up a trial month to give them time to get their footing and figure out how you like things done. And ultimately to help you guys decide if it's a fit for both of you. It's just as important that you're a good fit for the virtual assistant as it is that the virtual assistant is a good fit for you. And then this last piece here is to make sure you check in often, but definitely don't micromanage. So you may decide that you want to have weekly team meetings or a quick text check in every morning to make sure everything is running smoothly and if your virtual assistant has questions for you. In the beginning, while working with your virtual assistant during a test or trial period, you'll want to touch base more often until they get comfortable with their role. Even though you're busy, you need to make sure that you make time and space for communication with your virtual assistant if you want them to be successful. As far as action steps besides what we just talked about, you should go ahead and assign your virtual assistant a test project or specify the length of the trial period.

[00:24:47.210] - Kayla
If doing a trial period, the dates of the trial should be spelled out in the contract that you've both signed. You also need to go ahead and schedule a check-in meeting for the end of the trial period or at the end of the test project to decide if you want to move forward with hiring or retaining the virtual assistant over the long term. And then finally, the last thing you need to do is to make sure you schedule weekly or regular check-ins throughout the test or trial to be able to communicate clearly with your virtual assistant. Okay. So as we wrap things up here, I have a couple of questions for you. So first, are you ready to stop overworking yourself and experiencing burnout?
