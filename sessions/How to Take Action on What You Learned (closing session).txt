[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton
Hey, guys. It's Liz Stapleton. I can't believe that this is the last session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, February 2020. It has been incredible to see everything the speakers have presented, to see you guys and your feedback. I'm sure you guys took a ton of note because it was a lot of sessions, and you're probably feeling a little bit overwhelmed right now, maybe, with all the things on your blogging to-do list. In this session, I'm We're really going to talk about how you can take action on everything you learned because you learned a lot, a lot of that. This is just some of the stuff you guys posted in comments and emails and in the Facebook group. And it was just you love the session, you took so many notes, and just now I'm sure you have a lot to do. There was actually a lot more than this. I just tried to get some of it in here. So how do you actually implement it all? So first of all, I want you to realize that any progress is progress. And I'll show you what I mean, because you do not have to get everything done that you learned in the next week.

[00:01:13.820] - Liz Stapleton
I know you want to, but sleep's important, family's important. If you have a dog like me, she's going to whine at you if you're working all the time. But any progress is progress. And I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you some embarrassing pictures of my website. So I want to show you what my website first looked like. So if you're new, really, I guarantee you're probably miles ahead of where I was. This was the very first version of my website in August 2014. It was called Friday Night's Shenanigans. You can't even... It's terrible colors. It's awful, right? A year later, it's actually not that much better. I had between then, between 2014 and this is August 2015, I had actually taken and signed up for my very first blogging course. I think I signed up in May. And so that's why I have an email list stuff going. But that's about all I had going for it. I managed to finally figure out how to make a drop-down menu. Took me six months to figure out how to make a drop-down menu, but good times. And then this was in summer or fall of 2016.

[00:02:14.360] - Liz Stapleton
Again, still not that much better. I have a better background, still can't totally read the writing. I would like to go ahead and take credit that I took that picture that's the background because I was trying to make stock photos or something and doing a terrible job. It's like a white sheet, Anyway, this is like two years in the blogging, guys, and my site looks like this. So I promise you, any progress is progress. And then I changed names and There we ran in. This was the first version of the rebrand in 2017. And then finally in 2018, started to see my site take shape into what it is now. It's a little bit closer. And then I really haven't touched it in a year, but this is it looks like today. So this is when I started. This is when I started, this is today. So any progress is progress. And don't be afraid to put things out there. They're not going to be perfect. You're probably going to cringe when you go back and look at them. I definitely cringe when I see this on so many levels. I don't know why. I had DIY.

[00:03:19.700] - Liz Stapleton
I'm not a craft blogger. I didn't know what I was doing. So just any progress is progress. And then I want you to recognize the layout of the So I was very intentional on how I crafted the schedule of the summit. So the first day was foundational stuff. We had tech sessions, we had design and branding sessions. Day two, we got into more of the... So day one was foundational, and day two was a bit more of the structure. We had content creation sessions. We had legal sessions to make sure you're protecting your business. We had a bunch of other... So I was very... First day is foundational, second day was structural. Third day, we were talking about marketing and how to get your stuff out there with social media and Pinterest and YouTube. I believe that was the right day. And just really getting stuff out there. And then day four was about monetization, where you learn how to navigate your analytics and how to do sales pages and create courses and do sponsored content. So it was really focused on monetization. And then today has really been focused on automating, systemizing, scaling, and time management, because it can be a lot.

[00:04:38.240] - Liz Stapleton
So recognize the layout of the summit and how it was presented. And then think, is your foundation strong? You probably learned a lot in those sessions the first day. Go ahead and try to implement some of those things. Make sure you've learned the tech. And then just anything that you're like, yeah, I need to do. That's probably stuff that you only have to once. So maybe you just need to go fill in that foundation a little bit. Maybe make that your first thing you do. And then just get it done, get it off the list. And then I want you to look at the structure of your blogging business. So Tuesday, it wasn't just content, it wasn't just legal stuff. We also had some accountants talking the money side of blogging and having to be a CEO and look at things like that. Look at the structure of your blogging business. Is that sound? Do you need to register with your state? Do you want to form a business entity? Do you have a separate banking account for your blogging stuff? Do you have a privacy policy on your site? These are all things that you want to just...

[00:05:41.080] - Liz Stapleton
Again, they're typically things that it's setting it up right, that you may have skipped over. If you've been blogging for a little while, I definitely skipped over some of these at the beginning. So you want to just go in, set your strong foundation from those sessions, go and look at the structure, and do what you need to do to make sure you're protecting yourself and you're setting up your business for success and for growth. And then day three, once you've got the foundation stuff and the structure stuff set, then you want to come up with your marketing strategy. Don't try to do it all at once. Really focus on Pinterest if you're going to focus on Pinterest, or really focus on YouTube if you're really going to focus on YouTube. Do one at a time. Don't try to do all the things. Maybe YouTube is not your thing, or Pinterest isn't your thing, or Instagram isn't your or it's just not where your audience is. Maybe your audience isn't on Pinterest, maybe they're on Instagram. It just depends. You need to know your audience. And that was a theme running through, I think, many of the sessions throughout the summit is knowing your audience.

[00:06:44.690] - Liz Stapleton
And knowing your audience is going to help you figure out what marketing strategy is going to best for you. Because you not only want to go where your audience is going to be, but you also want to go where you enjoy. If you hate Instagram, can you find your audience somewhere else? Or maybe You don't want to do Instagram. I mean, everyone's a little bit different. Everyone has different strengths. So day three was marketing stuff. Come up with a marketing strategy. Look at the notes from day three and make a list of ideas. We're not going to... You don't have to implement them all. We're going to get to that list of ideas in a bit. But look at your day one notes, make a list of what needs to be done. And I would probably prioritize those. We'll get to that in a minute. Day two, what's I'm on the list? Just make a giant list. I know it's going to be a lot. I have been blogging for obviously years and I learned a lot from the summit. I have a long list that I'm going to share with you guys, just as an example.

[00:07:41.050] - Liz Stapleton
So we're going to talk about how to deal with that. But look at the marketing strategy you want to focus on and really write it down and get clear, because I know when you end up with so many ideas from summits or from conferences, it can be hard to implement if you're not really clear on them and you like And ideas can go floating, right? And you need to capture ideas, right? Jeff Goin talked about that, is you need to capture your ideas. If you've ever read Big Magic, it's a similar thing. But yeah, so capture the idea is in a big list. We're going to deal with that list in a minute, but make sure you do that. Focus on one monetization strategy at time. So maybe you want to go through your entire site and optimize it for affiliate marketing. Fine. Do that, but make Take out your focus and realize it's going to take more than a day. It takes time. Give yourself time. Give yourself a month, two months, three months, depending on how much content is on there. And say, Okay, well, each day I'm going to do two posts.

[00:08:43.260] - Liz Stapleton
I'm going to go through and make sure they're optimized. I use Lasso, which makes it easy for me to tell how well monetized a page or post is. But there's other things you could do. You could go post by post. It's up to you. And then systemize one thing at a time as well. Because, and I'm guilty of this too, when you try to systemize all the things, it can get complicated really fast. But if you just do one thing at a time, it's easier to replicate that system for other stuff. And I find the simpler things are, the better they work, personally. So I just want to keep that in mind. And then when you can, upgrade to tools that allow you to automate. When you can afford it. And there are some free tools. So I automate with free tools. I use a lot of Google stuff that I can just automate. Zapier is a great automation tool that has a wonderful free plan. I was on it for years. I literally just had to upgrade to it this year. And I've been blogging since 2014. So, wow, almost six years. Anyway, so like Zapier is a free tool.

[00:09:52.130] - Liz Stapleton
So there's free tools out there that can grow with you. Clickup, you've heard talked about a lot in the summit. It's free, Airtable is free. You So there's lots of free tools you can use that can grow with you. But you do, like Jen Williams said, you want to pick something that can grow with you because it's a pain to move stuff over. I've been through that more than once through email marketing services and course platforms. And just, yeah, it's annoying. I think I finally found my Goldilocks moment with tools in 2020. So what I want you to do is I want you to say, I'm just three things to get done this next week. And I want you to comment Comment below with what you're going to do in the next week. I want you to commit to that. Just three things. And maybe there are three things from the foundational stuff. Maybe it's three things from the structural. Maybe it's three things from three different days. It's really up to you and I think you need to pay attention to what is going to make the biggest difference in your blogging business. Also what excites you most.

[00:10:51.390] - Liz Stapleton
Because if there's three things you dread, you're not going to get them done. At least one or two of them has to be exciting where you can't wait to see what the change what it's going to do for your business. One should probably be an easy check off. But yeah, so I want you to review your notes, like I said, and then make a list of everything. And then I want you to implement the strategy that Jennifer Dawn covered. If you missed her session, basically what she said, and it was light bulbs for me. I was like, I can't believe I've never done this, is when you look at that list, you need to designate the priority of those. So are they A tasks? Are they B-level tasks? Are they C-level tasks? I think she said D and E, but I'm going to focus on A, B, and C. And then make sure that each day you're getting at least one A-level task done. So prioritize them like that. And if you feel like you're not making progress, you need to look, Okay, well, have I just been working on C-level tasks? Because that makes a big difference.

[00:11:48.390] - Liz Stapleton
So think about that. And I'm just going to give you an example because I'm sure you have long lists. This is part of my list, and some of this existed before the summit. But I was like, I really need to fix my Google Analytics. My Google Analytics has, I am embarrassed to say this, but it's been messed up for a year, and I don't know why. I've tried to go in and figure it out a couple of times. I need to just sit down and do it and get it fixed. I need to set up. I use Lasso. I pay for Lasso. I use it on one site, I can use it on my other. I just haven't done it. I really want to read the brand storytelling book that Lanie Lamere mentioned because it's not the first time that book has been mentioned to me. I feel like the more I hear it, the more I'm like, Yeah, I need to go read I want to implement her Airtable base because it's very different than how I've thought about a content strategy before. I need to complete my move to Elementor. If you guys saw that session or some of the other sessions, I have been moving away from a different page builder that I have been using.

[00:12:45.390] - Liz Stapleton
And I had been struggling with Elementor until I took Pete's lesson, and then it just really helped me a lot. Like his one session, and I was off to the races with Elementor. So I need to finish moving everything over. I need my home page on my Less Debt, More Wine site, which is my personal wine site, which I showed the example of. If you're on mobile, there's no way to easily access the blog, which is bad. And I need to fix that. So I want to look at my brainstormed list of ideas, and then I want to marry them with my Google Search Console data, because I have Google Search Console. I've had it set up for a long time, but I've never really dug in. And there were some great sessions in the summit when I When I was recording with speakers, I was like, I need to do this. I'd love to start doing video. I'm not going to go through my entire list, okay? But the point is everyone's got a list, okay? But I'm going to ABC these, making it so people can actually get to my blog. That's probably an A-level task.

[00:13:48.530] - Liz Stapleton
It won't take long, but it's something that needs to be done. Completely moving everything to Elementor, that's going to take me time. That's something I'm going to be in the next quarter. By the end of the next quarter, I want to be moved over to Elementor. Part of the reason is because I don't want to renew the other page builder I've been using. So you can look at things like that to create the dates. And then don't go to alone. Blogging, you're in front of your computer the whole time. And it can be lonely. And so I really found the most progress with my blog and got the furthest when I had others to talk to and made friends that were other bloggers. So go join the Facebook group if you're not in there already. The Facebook group is staying open after the summit is over. So that is a great group of people that you can relate to and talk to and help you stay accountable and on track. And if you're looking for something more than just a Facebook group, let me know because I am playing with some ideas on that front.

[00:14:49.280] - Liz Stapleton
But I'd love to hear what you'd be interested in. What would help you to stay on track with all the ideas from the summit? What accountability do you feel you need? Let me know. Tell me in the comments, tell me in the Facebook group, because I would love to try to provide that for you because I know this is a lot and it can be a lot. But don't go alone with blogging. Make a friend It can be you find a couple of people, maybe from the Facebook group, and you create a mastermind where you meet once a month. Masterminds have pushed me to new heights. They truly have. I've been a few. I've left some. It happens. But they can be a great way to just hold you accountable, because if you have other people that know you're working on something, and by the next call, you haven't done anything on it, they're going to call you out. And it's helpful, but it's in a supportive way, because I don't know about you guys, but I've been blogging for six years. My family still doesn't understand what I do. My parents and my sister, they're asking me about the summit or something, and I was like, well, it's not really...

[00:15:56.410] - Liz Stapleton
And they're like, yeah, we still know what you do. And I've been self-employed for over three years. So if it weren't for my blogging friends, then I know I never would have gotten self-employed. I'd never be doing this summit for you guys, especially because many of my blogging friends are speakers. And then I'm so excited to meet the speakers I didn't know and get to get to talking with them. It's a lot of fun. Just reach out. You'd be surprised at how generous the blogging community can be and how many people are willing to be like, Yeah, I need a buddy, too. So don't go it alone. Don't be afraid to switch things up. If one group isn't working for you, no drama. Just feel like, guys, I'm going to move on and go find another group to create or something. That's fine, too. So don't go to alone. And give yourself grace. Because I know blogging can just take over your life. But of course, life is about more than just blogging about it. Give yourself grace to do one thing at a time. If all you do each day is get one thing off that list or even one subtask off that list, because some of those, at least from my list, it actually has several steps to it for me to actually get that done.

[00:17:15.140] - Liz Stapleton
I just get one step done. Because you're looking at this list and it's on top of what you're already doing with your blog, creating content regularly, whatever it is you're already doing, chances are this list is piling on. And hopefully some of the systems and automations, and Kayla had a great session on how to onboard a VA, hopefully all that will help you to take some off the plate or lower the amount of time it takes to do things. Some of the perks should help you Look at that. And yes, there's paid products and the perks, but there's also my magic pin generator that I created. It's totally free for my subscribers. I should say it's totally free for my subscribers. But you just subscribe and then you're able to put in 10 titles into a form. In a few minutes, it's going to send you an email with 50 pins. So five pens for each post or each title that you do. And you can swap stuff out. The graphics that are in there, you can use because I took them, so I own them. I'm like, Yeah, go ahead and use these on the pins if they work for you.

[00:18:16.770] - Liz Stapleton
So give yourself grace. Do one thing at a time. And that's one of the hardest lessons I had to learn in my almost six years of blogging, is giving myself a break because it is 100 % possible to constantly be working on your blog. I've done it. And life's not that fun, we need to. It's unhealthy for me in a lot of ways, at least. So give yourself grace, give Give yourself a break. Don't beat yourself up. I know none of us want a post to go out late, but if it's just a one-off, your audience will understand. No one's perfect. So I just like to say that. Give yourself grace. And then finally, I just want you... In case anyone hasn't told you today, you are capable. Because if I can do it, really anyone can. Do you recall what my site first looked like? And I'm still here. So if you're willing to dig in your heels and keep going at it, I found in my experience and just talking to other bloggers and stuff, typically, if you can make it a year blogging, you're going to make it. So you are capable. If I can do as anyone can, I mean, My parents are vastly different technologically, and I probably take after more leaning towards my mom who can walk towards a computer and it'll crash.

[00:19:39.180] - Liz Stapleton
I am not kidding. And so it's a long running joke. She was like, here, Let me show you. And she's managed to do it on multiple occasions. I don't know why computers don't like her. So I can figure it out. You totally can. I've never been a super techy person, but I am stubborn and I do like to learn and I don't stop learning. So I think if you follow those as well, you're going to make... You're going to hit your goals. And hopefully you've taken a lot away from this summit. And if not, if there was a session you were absolutely dying to see, and you miss it, you can always grab the All Access Pass. That is available to you. And it will give you lifetime access to the session. So you can go back and watch ones you missed or rewatch ones, because I definitely... In preparing for the summit, I watched many of the sessions more than once to get everything ready, which we still had a couple of tech issues, and I do apologize for that. I tried to get those fixed as quickly as possible, but I was pretty proud that we had as few tech issues as we did because I had spent so much time going through them.

[00:20:46.840] - Liz Stapleton
And I feel like every time I went through them, I took away something new. So consider that if you need the extra time, consider getting the all access pass, but no pressure. Hopefully you got a ton out of this. Go join the Facebook group. It is free to join. There's a great group in there. Everyone's super nice. I like hanging out with you guys in there and I'm not going away. So the Facebook group isn't going to suddenly shut down or go dark when the summit ends. If you want to keep things rolling, go join the group. Let me know if there's something that I can do to help you, please tell me that, too. You would shoot me an email, hello@elizabethstapleton.Com. Hello@elizabethstapleton.come I can talk, I swear I can say my name. Or tag me on social media or DM or something. I'm not as good at checking the DMs, actually. So email is probably best for tagging me if I'm being completely honest. But yeah, so you are capable. Give yourself grace. Don't go it alone. And look at that list. Go through all your notes, make a list. A, B, C.

[00:21:56.540] - Liz Stapleton
That. Prioritize those tasks. And then set realistic like, my goal this quarter is to get this one task done. Maybe that's it. Or my goal this month, don't be like, I'm going to try to get all this done in the next two weeks because you will burn yourself out. And blogging is a lot of fun, but burning out is not. So don't do that. And guys, I cannot thank you enough for coming to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. It has been a labor of love for me as I've worked on it, especially the first time. And I put in hundreds of hours of work. And so I'm so glad you guys showed up and found value in it. And hopefully the next one will be even better. So thank you again for being part of the summit. I hope you found this helpful. If there's anything I can do that could be helpful or make this better, please, please tell me. I'll catch you guys at the next summit.
