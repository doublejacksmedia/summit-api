Hey, hey, I'm Monica Louie, thank you so much for joining me for this session at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm so honored and excited to have you here.

[00:00:20.510] - Monica
So today we are talking about how to build a blogging business that scales to six figures and beyond. And as I mentioned, ironically, I'm a Facebook and Instagram Ads Atrategist. And while I'm not a "blogger" today, my business has served many six, seven and eight figure online businesses, including many successful online bloggers. And I also started off as a blogger myself. So I'm honored to be here with you today. Here is what we are going to cover today.

[00:00:52.100] - Monica
I'm going to share the five key elements to building a thriving and sustainable online business. I'm going to break down the seven essential steps for creating and scaling a six figure business. So this is how to incorporate those five key elements and really take action.

[00:01:09.710] - Monica
And I'm going to share why you don't need a website when you're just starting out.

[00:01:15.350] - Monica
Yes, it's true. And I'll explain why. And a little bit.

[00:01:18.680] - Monica
And along the way, I'll be sharing my top recommended resources to help you take action and scale to six figures and beyond. And I hope you've downloaded your accompanying worksheet as we go through this training. I hope that you take action after the training and really fill out all those questions. It will help you incorporate what I'm about to share with you today into your own online blogging business so that you can grow and scale to six figures and beyond. So just a little bit about me.

[00:01:49.860] - Monica
As I mentioned, I started off as a blogger myself, and my blog was called Our Debt Free Family sharing my family's journey out of debt.

[00:01:58.700] - Monica
In two short years, my husband and I paid off $120,000 of debt, all on a single middle class income. And as we started paying off the debt really quickly, it was after I left my job to be a stay-at-home mom with my two little-bitty kids. But my goal was to build a business from home. But I had no idea what I could do.

[00:02:18.470] - Monica
Well, after I left my job, we started paying off the debt and people were asking us how we were doing it. So I figured I'd started to learn about online business and blogging and I figured it was a great way to help people and hopefully inspire them to take action to get out of debt for their families as well.

[00:02:33.830] - Monica
So that's how I started with Our Debt Free Family and I dove in learning from people like Pat Flynn and Amy Porterfield. And I actually learned the value and power of Facebook and Instagram Ads from Amy Porterfield herself, which led me to eventually selling my blog and diving in to be a full time Facebook Ads coach in the beginning.

[00:02:57.740] - Monica
And now I have an agency with a virtual team of team members all across the United States, and we serve our online business clients, many of whom are bloggers and many amazing brands. This is just a sampling of some of the brands that we've worked with over the past few years. But I ended up selling my blog because I started off helping people with their own Facebook ads and realized that I really enjoyed helping other people grow their businesses. So that's why I sold the blog and dove full force headfirst into building my Facebook ads business.

[00:03:32.660] - Monica
I'm also the creator of Flourish with Facebook ads, which is my online training program to teach people how to create their own high converting Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns.

[00:03:42.440] - Monica
So let's get started. Let's dive right in to the five key elements to building a thriving and sustainable business. So as you've seen, I've worked with many successful businesses over the past several years and I have my own multi six figure business. We've been multiple six figures in annual revenue for the last several years. So I learned a lot. When I think about what really leads to the success in the online space, what really leads to building a thriving and sustainable business.

[00:04:11.660] - Monica
Most of the successful businesses that I've encountered, that I've seen in the online space that I've worked with, have these five key elements. So that's why I want to share them with you.

[00:04:21.290] - Monica
So the first one is you've got to have the right mindset. You've got to have the, "I'm going to figure this out. I'm going to make it happen." Kind of mindset. You've got to have the confidence in yourself. If you're just starting out, you've got to believe that you can become a six figure CEO.

[00:04:38.310] - Monica
You've got to believe that you can make it happen and understand there will be challenges along the way. A lot of times I see people quit because there seems to be a challenge that comes up. It's too big. It's too, too much to overcome or it feels like it's too much to overcome. And they just give up and maybe they give up on their business or they give up on a strategy that if they just continued with it, maybe tried a couple of different things, that they would have made it work.

[00:05:04.670] - Monica
And the most successful business owners have the mindset. Figuring it out and being committed to their business, so a couple of resources that I will share with you, a couple of my favorite books. Great, by Angela Duckworth. This is a fantastic book about the power of passion and perseverance. You've got to have this mindset of perseverance in your business if you're going to grow and scale to six figures and beyond.

[00:05:30.840] - Monica
And then The Magic of Thinking Big by David J Schwartz. This book, I think I first heard it recommended by Tim Ferris a few years ago. And it's a fantastic book. It's it's many decades old, but everything in this book still applies today, and it definitely applies to setting yourself on the path to building a six figure plus business.

[00:05:54.690] - Monica
So the second key is to really understand your avatar. And I will definitely go into this more because this is such a critical component. But you've got to understand who your avatar is, what's important to them, what are their pain points. And so I'll give you some resources later on where you can take action on this key element.

[00:06:14.220] - Monica
The third key element is you've got to have a high quality offer. Many successful businesses, I mean, every successful business, they have a high quality offer. If they don't have a high quality offer, then people are not going to pay them money. So as you're just starting out, think about what can, what a high quality offer can be for your ideal customer avatar. And we'll talk about some ideas today as well.

[00:06:36.120] - Monica
So just getting started, it could be an affiliate product on your blog. That's the easiest way, I think, to get started by offering a high quality offer and getting paid for it. If you're not getting paid, you don't have a business. If you are just blogging, blogging, and blogging and you're not getting paid you don't have a business yet, you have a hobby. So that's why I want you to think about what you can get paid for. So it could be a physical product, it could be a digital product like a course or an e-book or software or it could be a service.

[00:07:08.100] - Monica
When I started off with my Facebook Ads business, I started off first with a service doing one-on-one coaching, teaching people how to create campaigns on their own and coaching them along the way. So I started off in this business as with a service in my blogging business. I had affiliate offers and also I offered a service with my financial coaching. So think about what you can incorporate into your blogging business.

[00:07:35.700] - Monica
So the next key element is marketing. You've got to fall in love with marketing.  You absolutely, I know a lot of people want to kind of shy away from this piece, but you don't have a business if people aren't paying you and if they don't know about you and what you're offering, then they're not going to pay you. So marketing is the action or business of promoting and selling products or services.

[00:07:57.120] - Monica
So a few resources here for you. Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller. This is one of my top most recommended books. This is a fantastic book. He's also got a Podcast, a course he does workshops. He's got a lot of things around this concept of the brand script, which is this process that he takes you through in this book. And I loved it so much that I incorporated this into my business.

[00:08:20.130] - Monica
So on my agency side of my business, my team and I go through the brand script process that he outlines in this book with every single new client that we bring on board so that we can really understand who their ideal customer is and how we can best position their products, their offering, offerings to their ideal customer through the Facebook ad. So I can't recommend this book enough.

[00:08:47.090] - Monica
Another one, Great Marketer, Russell Branson, Expert Secrets, absolutely love this book, but all of his books are fantastic. Then there's Contagious, which I don't hear mentioned a lot, but I think it's a fantastic book by Jonah Berger. It really, so, as the subtitle implies, why things catch on. It really explains what makes people gravitate towards specific social media posts or different specific offerings. I think it's really a fascinating book for marketers to read and understand, and then also a wonderful book for marketing to really understand the psychology of persuasion, as it says called Influence by Robert Giardini.

[00:09:27.930] - Monica
And so this is where he introduced in this book. I think he was the first one to introduce the, the ideas of scarcity and urgency, or at least he was the first one to bring attention to them.  Scarcity and urgency and many other elements that can help you in your marketing and letting people know why your offer is the best offer for them and how to you persuade them to take action now as opposed to putting that off. So some amazing resources for you there.

[00:09:57.210] - Monica
And then the fifth and final key element is recurring revenue. Yes, we want revenue in our business, but it's better to have recurring revenue.

[00:10:06.870] - Monica
That's how you build a thriving and sustainable business so that you know what revenue you can expect month after month after month, and then, of course, we want to grow that revenue, but it's great to have a baseline revenue amount that, you know, you can expect so that you can plan.

[00:10:22.430] - Monica
What are you going to invest in? You can go through a training. You can hire a coach. You can do, make these investments very consciously and aware because you know that you've got the money coming in your business. So a few different ways that you can build a recurring revenue into your business is to have an evergreen sales funnel.

[00:10:40.310] - Monica
So this is where you'll make a sale once to one customer. But you've got this evergreen sales funnel running so that, you know, it's driving sale after sale after sale. You're getting consistent sales.

[00:10:51.860] - Monica
You can offer monthly services like I do so with my ads management plans, with my, on my ad agency side of my business. They pay us monthly for the service that we provide, which is their, their Facebook and Instagram, ad management and creation. And so we know when they when they on board, they sign a contract for a specific length of time to work with us. And so we are committed to working together during that length of time.

[00:11:17.840] - Monica
So I know when they signed the contract that I can rely on that revenue in my business coming month after month after month. And so it just helps you have that confidence that you're not wondering where your next dollar, where your next sale is going to come. It's really great to have that. So that's one way to build recurring revenue. Another really popular way to build recurring revenue is through a membership.

[00:11:38.000] - Monica
You can create a membership program and it could be a low dollar membership where it's an easy "yes" for somebody to get started and, and join your membership. And they get a ton of value for a very low price. But then over month after month after month, you know, your rate of retention, you know how many members you have in your membership, and then you know how much you can rely on month after month. Another way to do this is to have a payment plan.

[00:12:05.090] - Monica
So I know Amy Porterfield, she had some courses. She offered at about a thousand dollars for each course.

[00:12:11.750] - Monica
And, you know, that's  a pretty significant amount of money for people to put down in one lump sum. And so what she did is she offered a 12 month payment plan at $97 a month. So it made that investment to take her course and apply it to your business so much easier to take on.  So much easier to to do, because it's a much smaller amount when compared to a thousand dollars. So it made it really easy for people to say yes to purchasing her product.

[00:12:44.840] - Monica
But then she knew for 12 months she was going to be receiving $97 a month from all the customers that signed up for that product. All right. So just a quick review of the five key elements. The first one is you've got to have the mindset. You've got to understand there will be challenges in building your business, but commit to working through those challenges.

[00:13:06.710] - Monica
You can figure it out, you can't figure it out. You can't, you got to know that you have the confidence you will figure this out and you will grow your business. And if you're like me, you are growing your business to help other people.

[00:13:19.490] - Monica
So keep that in mind as you're growing your business, as you hit challenges, that there are people out there who need your help, that if you just pursue, you persevere and figure it out, you will be able to help more people with your business and your offerings.

[00:13:33.770] - Monica
The second one is to understand your ideal customer avatar. Third one is to have a high quality offer that helps people get results. The fourth one is your marketing.

[00:13:44.960] - Monica
Got to love your marketing. You've got to have your marketing machine.

[00:13:47.360] - Monica
We're going to talk about that here in a minute too. And then build in recurring revenue. See how you can build recurring revenue into your business model. If you don't have it already, it can really help you have that confidence in investing in your business to grow it.

[00:14:03.080] - Monica
So let's put this all together.

[00:14:04.880] - Monica
I'm going to share with you the seven essential steps for creating and scaling your six figure business. So this is for creating, you're going to, if you are just starting out and you don't have a business yet, I invite you to think strongly about going through each step, in order. If you already have a business off the ground, then maybe you did things in a little bit different order and that's OK. But think through these seven steps and figure out which ones maybe you need to spend more time on to really grow and scale your business.

[00:14:35.160] - Monica
OK, so the first one is you're going to develop a skill, service, or product the people will pay for. Again, you do not have a business if people are not paying you money for an offering, in exchange for an offering, for a service, for a product.

[00:14:51.500] - Monica
So you need to develop your skill or your service or your product so that people can pay you money for it. That's the first one. Again, you've got to have an offer the people will pay you for. All right.

[00:15:04.640] - Monica
Step two is start helping people and produce fantastic results. So as you start working with people, you have them go through your course, you have them go through your e-book, you work with them one on one, like I did one of my coaching business when I first got started with Facebook Ads coaching, you will learn one of their questions.

[00:15:23.810] - Monica
How can you make this better? And you will learn whether they are getting the results that they're expecting from this offering or if you need to make tweaks. And so you've got to start helping people incorporate their feedback and help them produce fantastic results.

[00:15:38.930] - Monica
Then you can move to next, to step three. So when I first started, step three is niche down and understand your avatar. So it's really important to niche down. When I first started with Facebook ads coaching, I started helping people in the online personal finance space. Many personal finance bloggers are reaching out for my help. But then as more people learned that I was a Facebook ads coach, more people in different niches, different types of businesses started reaching out for my help with their Facebook Ads. So at first I said yes to anybody who wanted to hire me to help them with their Facebook Ads.

[00:16:14.420] - Monica
But as I kind of tested the waters with different different types of business owners, different business models and their Facebook ad strategy, I learned that really I was getting the best results in helping personal finance bloggers. I really understood their audience really well since I came from that space. But I also understood the strategy and I was really perfecting it really well. So I was getting amazing results time after time with with those types of clients. So I decided to specifically focus on personal finance bloggers.

[00:16:45.080] - Monica
And now as my business has grown a few years later, we definitely work with online businesses outside of the personal finance space. We still have some personal finance clients, but we definitely work with online businesses in all kinds of different industries. But we are still niche down in the fact that we focus on online businesses with digital products because we know that we can serve them really well. So you want to stay in your specialty and your experience and where you know that you're helping people get results.

[00:17:16.760] - Monica
So it's OK to start off if you're just getting started with testing the waters with different types of avatars, but then really focus in on who do you want to work with?

[00:17:27.500] - Monica
So think about that. So as I got started with my Facebook Ads coaching business, I knew I wanted to work with online business owners because that was my that was my experience becoming, you know, as a blogger myself and really learning and and geeking out about online business and marketing strategy. So I knew that I wanted to work with them. And and also I knew that I had a great network in the personal finance blogging space.

[00:17:49.580] - Monica
And who will pay you. Who will actually give you money for your offerings. Think about that. That's a really important element that a lot of people don't think of as they're getting started. They know they've got an experience or a specialty or some kind of skill that they can offer. And, but they don't think about if their ideal avatar will actually pay them. So those two things have to be there. And then who knows? They need your help. So your sale, your offering is going to be a whole lot easier to sell if people know that they need your help.

[00:18:22.010] - Monica
This doesn't have to be there, but it's a whole lot easier to make the sale if it's there. So when I first started with Facebook ads coaching back in the end of 2016, early 2017, Facebook ads was a really hot strategy. It still is today. A lot of people really want to incorporate Facebook ads into their business, but is a really hot strategy in the personal finance blogging space. A lot of people were really curious about how they could incorporate Facebook Ads into their strategy to grow their blogs and their online businesses.

[00:18:53.810] - Monica
And so that's why it made it easier for me to get clients because they were coming to me, because they knew that they needed my help and because I was niche down. I served so many people in the personal finance blogging space, they knew that I was the person to go to.

[00:19:07.850] - Monica
And I still get clients and prospects reaching out to me in the personal finance blogging space because I've made a name for myself as the Facebook expert in that niche. So it really helps to niche down. You don't have to stay niche down forever, but it really helps when you're getting started if you niche down.

[00:19:26.900] - Monica
OK, so Understanding Your Avatars and Resources, Building a Story Brand by Donald Miller again. And then Will It Fly? By my coach and mentor, Pat Flynn. This is a fantastic book. I love how he has so many exercises in this book that will really help you get clear on who your avatar is, what the market is currently offering to them, where some gaps might be in the market that you can slide right in and serve a specific pain point or a need that is not being met currently in the market.

[00:19:56.360] - Monica
It's really a fantastic book, I think. Will it Fly? Should be required reading for all online businesses.

[00:20:02.600] - Monica
All right. So step four. So now you've got your product. Got your avatar.

[00:20:08.730] - Monica
And you are helping people get amazing results, then you should start gathering testimonials and then share them. So you need to ask your customers, ask your clients, for testimonials.

[00:20:19.110] - Monica
I'm sure by this point, maybe some people are already giving you some testimonials without even being asked. But you want to really be intentional about gathering these testimonials. And this is not something that you ever stop. This is something that you're always going to keep doing in your business. You're always going to be needing to gather testimonials. So just ask them for their feedback. Ask them if they can provide a testimonial. Maybe you put together a quick survey so that you can easily organize the testimonials, but start gathering those testimonials and then where are you going to share them?

[00:20:50.670] - Monica
Well, you want to put them all over your website, want to put them in your content. You want to share them in your emails, in your sales funnels and your sales pages and your work with me pages.

[00:21:01.560] - Monica
And I also I created a praise page as I was getting a lot of testimonials early on in my business, I decided I was just going to create a page where I could put most of them, or at least a lot of them. And then you can check it out at monicalouie.com/praise if you like. But I've got the name.

[00:21:21.870] - Monica
I've got their headshot and I've got their little, you know, quoted testimonial there. And it's just a page that can point people to they want to know what it's like to work with me or my experience. And it's great because a lot of people recognize many of the business owners that are there and the brands that are there. And so that really helps build credibility without me, you know, it's easier for somebody to be convinced of how great your offer is if somebody else is telling them who has the credibility as opposed to you being the credible source, telling them how how great your your offer is. So that's where testimonials come in. All right.

[00:22:00.180] - Monica
So step five is to create your visibility plan. So this is how we're going to start to push out our offering, let people, more people, know about what we have to offer with our visibility plan. All right.

[00:22:16.560] - Monica
So this is where you create your website. So we're all the way to step five. And I haven't talked about creating your website.

[00:22:23.550] - Monica
I did talk about, in step four, about sharing testimonials on your website. Now you're going to create your website. So, again, if you already have an established business and you're figuring , you're wanting to figure out how to grow and scale it, then maybe you've done a little bit of this out of order.

[00:22:36.210] - Monica
Totally fine. Totally fine. But if you're just starting new, this is how I suggest you get your business off the ground so you can begin making money early on so you're not focused on a hobby. You've got an actual running business. OK, so you create your website and you're going to create a lead magnet. So the lead magnet, I'm sure most of you are familiar with this term. This is a freebie, an offering in exchange for an email address.

[00:23:04.320] - Monica
So this is the way that you can grow your email list so that you can email people who are your customers or who are not yet your customers. So you can get back in front of them. You can stay top of mind so that when they're ready to move forward with your paid offering, they will think of you. So it's super important to grow your email list and you do that most cases with a lead magnet.

[00:23:27.840] - Monica
There are other ways where you can just offer your newsletter. Most of the time you'll have better conversions, better sign ups, more sign ups, to your email list if you're offering a lead magnet. So just some ideas for lead magnet could be a checklist, a guide, a quiz, a video training or a webinar.

[00:23:46.170] - Monica
Just some ideas. There are many, many different ideas that you can use as a lead magnet.

[00:23:50.280] - Monica
But it's a freebie, a free offering that people will receive in exchange for their email address.

[00:23:57.720] - Monica
OK, on your website, you also have to have a sales pag,e or work with me page, or somewhere on your website where people can see what your offering is and pay you money.

[00:24:08.640] - Monica
So if you're focused on affiliate marketing as bloggers, if you focus on affiliate marketing to start, then you're going to have your affiliate links probably throughout your content, throughout your blog post, your, your Podcast show notes. But you could also have a resources page where you have affiliate links as well, where you have maybe your, you know, your highest recommended tools or resources for your audience.

[00:24:33.830] - Monica
As you can see, I've already shared a whole bunch of resources with you in today's training, but so maybe you could create a resource page if your focus is on affiliate marketing or maybe that's a sub focus, but you've got to have these key elements of your website.

[00:24:48.780] - Monica
It can be very simple. And then dive into your content marketing plan. So, of course, you know this. It could be your blog, Podcast, a YouTube channel. It could be public speaking. So I've spoken at a lot of different conferences over the years and it's a great way to meet people, especially if you know that your avatar is there attending those conferences. Nowadays, a lot of, you know, in-person conferences are online, they're doing virtual events, but there's also online summits like this.

[00:25:16.620] - Monica
Speaking at a conference or a Summit or an online event is a great way to build instant credibility because they, the people who are putting on, hosting the event would not just invite anybody. Right. They're going to they're going to want to bring the best to their audience. Also, podcast interviews.

[00:25:34.740] - Monica
I've gotten a lot of clients over the years from doing podcast interviews. I've done a lot of different podcast interviews over the years.

[00:25:41.490] - Monica
And it's a great way to get my name out there, my brand, my offerings, but also share the stories. They can build a relationship with me and it's fun to do. I enjoy connecting with other people in the space. And so I think it's a lot of fun and it's kind of an easier way to get into putting yourself out there.

[00:25:58.830] - Monica
I find at least being an introvert myself and again, just like with speaking, podcasters aren't going to just invite anybody to their podcast so that can help build instant credibility as well.

[00:26:10.680] - Monica
And then guest posts. You can still do guest posts and get on other people's blogs so that you can get your name out there in features so you can get featured on CNBC or Business Insider or something like that.

[00:26:23.700] - Monica
Then that can serve as instant credibility as well.

[00:26:26.670] - Monica
And then for your visibility plan.

[00:26:30.570] - Monica
There's also paid advertising, which is of course my favorite form of pushing your content out there and getting in front of people, getting, you know, getting more people to become aware of you, your brand, your offerings. So you can do Facebook, Instagram ads, Pinterest, promoted pins, Google, YouTube.

[00:26:53.130] - Monica
And so those are just some of the ad platforms, most common ad platforms. My team and I, we help people with Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest ads when it applies to their business model. So, so paid advertising is a great way to get in front of more people.

[00:27:11.460] - Monica
All right. So step six is to develop your plan for scaling. So you got your content out there. How are you going to scale?

[00:27:18.540] - Monica
You know, you're getting testimonials, you know, your offerings are getting results. You niche down. You  figured out who your avatar is and you understand their needs and you know how to position your offer as the best solution. So how are you going to scale your business now? Well, you have a couple of different options.

[00:27:35.910] - Monica
You could have more offerings or you could get more customers.

[00:27:40.980] - Monica
And I suggest scaling your first offer first and the way you do this, while the reason, before I get to the way you do this, the reason why you want to scale your first offer first is because a lot of us content creators, we get in the habit of creating content. We think, well, I created one product.

[00:27:57.480] - Monica
Now I can create another product. Now I can create another product.

[00:27:59.880] - Monica
We have all these product ideas that we just want to get out of us and get out into the world. But that means that we're putting the marketing of our initial product on the back burner.

[00:28:10.350] - Monica
And that can create confusion for us because we don't know which product to promote when. And it can also create confusion for our potential customers because there's so many different products to choose from.

[00:28:23.070] - Monica
How do I know which one is going to be the best suited for me in my stage of where I am at?

[00:28:28.440] - Monica
So I say keep it simple. Scale your offer first. And the best way to do that, I think, is by having a salesman also. This can become your evergreen sales funnel or you can do this with a live launch as well. So the sales funnel I'm going to go through with just the basic, basic elements of a sales funnel. And you can put this into like an email series and email autoresponder series, or you could put this in all in your webinar and your webinar training or video series.

[00:28:58.650] - Monica
But these are the basic elements of a sales funnel. So it initially starts with your lead magnet. What are they opting in for? What are they handing over their email address for in exchange for your freebie? And then introduce yourself and or your brand, then give value, give value, give value. You're building up that reciprocity because they're getting so much value from you. They're going to be more inclined to want to give you something in return.

[00:29:26.010] - Monica
Then you introduce the offer, you let them know that it's coming, then you make the offer. And along the way you want to be sharing testimonials and success stories. And then usually at the end, the offer expires, the bonus goes away, the discount goes away. There's some kind of end to the sales funnel that helps people get off the fence and make a decision. Are they in or are they out for now?

[00:29:47.220] - Monica
All right. So moving on to step seven. The seventh and final step is to drive traffic. This is how you're going to say, scale it up.

[00:29:54.360] - Monica
You're going to drive traffic to your sales funnel. So you could do organic traffic with SEO, Pinterest, media, which could be Podcast, interviews or guest posts or features or speaking.

[00:30:09.030] - Monica
So those are the organic forms of driving traffic, or again, my favorite form of driving traffic is via paid advertising with our friends Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Google and YouTube ads. All right. So to break it down here, the seven essential steps develop a skill service or product people will pay for, start helping people and produce fantastic results, niche down and understand your avatar, gather testimonials and share them, create your visibility plans so more people can find you.
