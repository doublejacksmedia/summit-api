All right, guys. I'm super excited for this expert. She is a business strategist and coach who helps service providers and coaches create businesses that allows them to work less than 20 hours a week and live life on their terms. So, her aim is to help you simplify, streamline, and scale your business to over six figures while keeping you in the CEO seat and not constantly working. It is Stephanie Blake. Stephanie, thank you so much for joining us again. I think you were one of the very first Summit speakers the first year, and I so appreciate you coming back.

[00:00:43.930] - Stephanie
Thank you for having me. I love to talk about this. I could talk about this all day, so you will have to cut me off at some point. But I'm so glad to be here and so excited to share this information with everybody listening in. 

[00:00:55.240] - Liz
Yes. Because I know a lot of bloggers, especially when they're starting their full-time job and trying to find that time and figure out what to do. So, I'm just going to dive in and ask sort of, what do you think the keys are to getting everything done just 20 hours a week like that's.

[00:01:11.060] - Stephanie
Yeah. Yeah. So, this is a loaded question because there's a lot of different things that I can say about this right now. But I will say the most important thing that you can do is have one offer that you're selling. So, I call this your six-figure signature offer, because what I do is I teach people how to reach six figures in 20 hours or less, ideally a week. So, by having that one six-figure signature offer, you're simplifying everything else in your business. So not just what you're selling, but it also simplifies everything on the back end of your business, too, which is what a lot of people don't necessarily think about. Right? Because you also need systems to run your business, especially as online business owners and bloggers. So, once you have that one offer, the six-figure signature offer, then you can market to your ideal client. So that would be my second piece of advice is to make sure that you are solving one problem for one person, and you need to know who this person is on a really deep soul level. So, not just saying like, you want to work with somebody or you want to support somebody because you want to give them more time or in their schedule or more money in their bank account.

[00:02:22.030] - Stephanie
Those are very surface level [inaudible 00:02:25] struggles that they have. We need to speak on them, speak to them on a deeper level. And once you can connect with them, that's when the sales start coming.

[00:02:32.790] - Liz
Yes. So, like, an example would be something like, I want them to have more time to read their favorite book and enough money to not stress about all the books they want to buy, you know like something really detailed because you're like, you know they love to read and they have no time.

[00:02:48.040] - Stephanie
Yeah, exactly.

[00:02:48.850] - Liz
Something like that. Okay, so.

[00:02:50.590] - Stephanie
But even deeper. Even deeper, more emotional.

[00:02:53.970] - Liz
Well, yeah. That's one little tiny aspect.

[00:02:57.540] - Stephanie
Exactly.

[00:02:57.850] - Liz
These sessions are 30 minutes or less.

[00:03:00.710] - Stephanie
That's what I said. You have to cut me off because I could talk about this for hours and hours. Yeah.

[00:03:04.980] - Liz
Okay, so we talk about you know your signature six-figure offer. That offer doesn't have to be a super high price point necessarily, depending on what you're doing. I know you focus on like service-based businesses, but some people do digital products, you know, like just because it's going to make you six figures doesn't mean you have to charge $5,000.

[00:03:25.170] - Stephanie
Yeah. I mean, it depends on what your goals are too. So, for example, you can have a business where you're charging high ticket and then you won't need as many clients. Or you can have a business where you're charging low tickets, where you're charging something for like, I don't know, $99 a month, which is much lower. But you need more people to fill that space. So, then how are you going to get those leads which will then turn into clients? Right. That's where a lot of the time comes in. Now if you're running ads, that's one route to go. If you're doing organic, that's another route to go. So, it all comes back to what you want, like how you choose to build your business. Because you get to decide which I love. Just great.

[00:04:00.220] - Liz
Yes. And I think so the back end in the system plays such a huge part because like you said, you want to focus on one offer. Because when you have two offers and you've got two sets of frequently asked questions, customer service issues, everything kind of expands. It's like, oh, I want to get the you know, a king size bed, well, now I need new sheets, a new comforter, you know like stuff expands. So, what are sort of the systems and even automations that you think help people kind of stay focused and get things done in those 20 hours?

[00:04:32.290] - Stephanie
Okay. So, I could get really nerdy and really technical here because if you ever logged into my Zapier account, which is a tool that I use for automations in my business, you will see over 150 different automations that I have set up my business.

[00:04:47.510] - Liz
Okay.

[00:04:48.280] - Stephanie
Because my rule of thumb is if I don't have to be doing it, I need to either delegate it, automate it, or eliminate it completely. So, there's very few things that I actually need to be doing as the CEO of my business. The vast majority of those things, which I realized after being a business for almost seven years at this point, could just be eliminated altogether. It was just unnecessary work that I was adding to my plate. But in terms of specific automations, it varies from business to business. But you should have if you're working with clients, you should have some kind of client onboarding sequence that should all be automated. You don't need to do any of that. If you send clients gifts, that can all be automated. If you're doing email marketing or posting on social media, all of that can be automated as well. So, all you should be focusing on as the CEO of your business is creating the content, and then somebody else can take care of the rest.

[00:05:45.880] - Stephanie
Either you're delegating it to an assistant to schedule that out, and then a tool like Plann, for example, that's what we use for social media. That takes care of scheduling it out for you at a later date, so you don't have to worry about it. So, those are a couple of very basic examples. Do you want me to get nerdy?

[00:06:02.080] - Liz
Yeah, get nerdy.

[00:06:02.460] - Stephanie
Okay. All right. Because then as you start to grow your business, you can start to add marketing funnels in, okay? So when we add these different funnels in, we can start with a Freebie or an Slo, which is a self liquidating offer. This is an offer on the front end that will bring people into your email list, and you can then nurture them to be a paying client. You could do this with a live launch. You could do this with an evergreen launch, or not necessarily evergreen launch, an evergreen marketing funnel. But essentially what you're doing is you're giving somebody the chance to opt into one thing. And I know a lot of bloggers do this to grow their email list, and then from there, you can send them down different routes based on how they identify themselves, essentially.

[00:06:50.520] - Stephanie
So, if they're like a beginning blogger, they can go down one funnel. If they're an intermediate blogger, they can go down another funnel. And then if they're more advanced, they can go down another funnel. All of these leads to your signature offer in some way, but it's all completely automated. Yeah, exactly.

[00:07:07.010] - Liz
Okay.

[00:07:07.950] - Stephanie
Exactly.

[00:07:09.340] - Liz
Oh, yeah. So, a couple of followup questions to some of the things you said.

[00:07:12.660] - Liz
I'm wondering if you can give some examples of things that you would eliminate or how you would decide that something should just be eliminated rather than delegated or automated.

[00:07:22.390] - Stephanie
So, my biggest question to you would be, does it result in money coming into your business? Is there a guaranteed return on your investment, either your investment of money or your investment of time? A lot of the time there's not. A lot of the things that I see people doing are like, I'm going to get a lot of back from the website designers in the group here, redesigning your website over and over again. You do not need to do that. You can put it up, it can live there for a couple of years. Once your brand grows and evolves and change, then you can change your website. Then you can update it. Your brand color, I see people tinkering with this all of the time and updating their logo. These are all things you don't need to be doing.

[00:08:03.840] - Liz
That's busy work that's procrastination in another form.

[00:08:07.180] - Stephanie
Exactly. And that's what people are doing. All of these things are things that can be eliminated, but they think they're necessary tasks to be working on. They're convincing themselves that these are the things that they need to be doing in order to grow their business. Because somebody on a podcast at one point told them that this is what they need to be doing. But these tasks are not actually aligned to their specific goals, right? So, everybody has a unique set of goals that they're working toward, and they have a unique set of tasks that need to be aligned with those goals. For example, if you let's just use the six-figure example. If you want to reach six figures and work less than 20 hours a week, there's really only two things you need to be doing. You need to focus on selling, and you need to focus on serving your clients. That's it. You don't need to focus on updating your website. You don't need to redo your logo a million and a half times. You don't even need a freebie at this point. Honestly, you can continue to do all of that on social media by selling through social media.

[00:09:07.180] - Stephanie
You don't even have to set up those complicated funnels that I just talked about. Right. So, don't get distracted by that. All you have to do is focus on having conversations with people, selling what you're great at, the offer that you have, and then serving those clients really well. Because what happens is those will turn into referrals, right? Those people will refer other people to you. So, hopefully, that simplifies it a bit for you.

[00:09:30.130] - Liz
Yes, I am going to be kind of devil's advocate because I feel like someone would be like, you make that sound really simple, you know just sell and whatever. But social media is hard and there's a gazillion different social media things and how do I do what, and which social media should I be doing? So, I feel like that's, yeah. But well, what if I'm not good at instagram.

[00:09:51.860] - Stephanie
Well, let's talk about it. So, if you're saying you're not good at Instagram, then you're just not trying hard enough. Frankly, you can watch a free YouTube video on anything these days to teach you how to do something. Now it all comes back to, like I said before, a six-figure signature offer. And knowing who you're speaking to, if you don't know who you're talking to, your content will never convert. So, you can spend hours and hours and hours creating content to post to social media, to send to your email list. But if what you're saying does not connect with somebody on that deep emotional, soul level, they will not buy from you. And this is where I see a lot of people getting hung up, is they don't know who they're talking to and they don't know how to talk to this person. So, when they're getting frustrated and saying they don't know how to use social media you know how to use social media. Everybody knows how to use social media. You log in, you create a post, you write...

[00:10:44.700] - Liz
Some people know more than others.

[00:10:46.120] - Stephanie
Okay. Some people know more than others. At a very basic level, you log in, you post an image, you put a caption up there, you would hit post. That's using social media. Right? So, at the end of the day, that's all you really have to do. Now from there, we also want to make sure we're having conversations with people, right? So, this is where it gets uncomfortable for people because people are afraid to have conversations with other people. They're afraid to put themselves out there and they're afraid to sell. So that's where the disconnect comes in that I see. They're afraid to sell and they don't know who they're talking to. So, yeah, that's when social media can be hard.

[00:11:20.170] - Liz
Okay, so what would you suggest are some exercises they could do if their content isn't converting like that, they're struggling with you know that connection to their audience and knowing where to find them. Because I think that directs kind of what social media you do as well. But what can they do to kind of get better at that and figure out what they're missing?

[00:11:38.640] - Stephanie
For sure. So, I have two pieces of advice. The first, look at the people that you enjoy following and ask yourself why you enjoy following them. There's usually like, I don't know, five to ten people that you are excited to look at, whether you're looking at their Instagram stories, whether you're opening up their emails. Ask yourself why, what kind of content is this person putting out that I enjoy reading, okay, or looking at, engaging with, whatever. And then the second part of that is when you're trying to figure out who you're marketing to, you need to, like I said, understand this person on a deep level. So I want you to write down 20 struggles that that person is experiencing right now. And again, we're not talking about more time or money, we want you to think deeper, right? So, we want you to think about, say you work with moms, I don't know and they want to lose weight. I don't know. So, I want you to put yourself in the shoes of this mom who is overweight. She's feeling like she's not going to be around when her kids grow up. She's feeling exhausted, she can't chase them around the yard.

[00:12:44.170] - Stephanie
She wants to eat healthy food, but she doesn't have the energy to cook the healthy food for herself. So, she's just continuing to eat the mac and cheese. Right? So, this is like the deeper level that we want to connect with them on. Not like, oh, you want to lose weight, do some situps while your kids napping. Right?

[00:13:02.140] - Liz
I want to nap while the kids napping is what they're thinking.

[00:13:05.040] - Stephanie
Right, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. But that's what people are saying, like they're talking on surface level, deeper, so that would be the second piece of advice to really dive, even put yourself in the shoes of that person. And a lot of the times, we are our own ideal client, which is great, so we could just look back on our own experiences to figure out what we went through and how we overcame that. And a lot of the times, it's going to connect with those people, too.

[00:13:30.270] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, I kind of like to think of it as like a toddler. You just need to when you think of a surface level, one ask, but why? And then the next one be like, but why?

[00:13:39.850] - Stephanie
Exactly.

[00:13:40.480] - Liz
Until you get to the root of what the real struggle is. And it's annoying when you do it to yourself, just like it's annoying when kids do it. But it's helpful for you. 

[00:13:53.360] - Stephanie
Really is. And write down all of this.

[00:13:54.880] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:13:55.150] - Stephanie
Write down everything. Because you're going to realize that, like you said, there's layers underneath both layers. And you can always come back to this as you're creating more content. I revisit this, my Ideal client at least once a quarter, if not more than that, because things change in the world too, right? The world that we live in today is not the world we were living in a couple of years ago, right, so the struggles that people have are changing along with that.

[00:14:21.340] - Liz
Yes, agreed. I mean, the way the world's changed. Okay, so I think even knowing all those things, trying to keep organized and stick to a routine that supports it, what are some ways you see people struggle with that and some solutions you might have?

[00:14:41.060] - Stephanie
Well, again, we need to go back to what are the things that you need to be doing in order to grow your business? So, just start by making a list of these things. Very simple way to get started. Like make a list of everything you're working on right now. And then if you have team members, include the things that they're working on too, because we don't want to give unnecessary work to team members, right? And then divide it into three columns, like, what can I automate? What can I eliminate? And what can I delegate? And by the time you whittle that list down, there should not be more than like five to ten things that only you can be doing. But again, a lot of people think that there are all of these necessary things that they need to be doing, right? So, I would start there, just put it in black and white, get it out in front of you, so that you know where to go from there. And then the next thing, look at what your goals are for the next three months, and then whittle that list down even more. So, for example, if you want to make $10,000 in the next three months, what are the actions that you can take from that list that are actually aligned to reach that goal.

[00:15:48.960] - Stephanie
And nine times out of ten, it's going to come back to marketing your business and selling and actually having to have conversations with people. It's not going to be redesigning your website. It's not going to be taking new photos for your branding. None of that matters. But those are the fun things that people like to be doing and say that they actually need when they don't. You don't need to start a podcast. You don't need to create another course. You don't need to be doing any of those things. You need to actually talk to people. That's what it boils down to.

[00:16:15.860] - Liz
And maybe remind yourself that talking to people is what leads to the money hitting your account. And that's really fun too. So, maybe just reframe things a little bit.

[00:16:23.440] - Stephanie
Yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's much more fun to have more money than it is to have not enough money telling you from experience. So, when in doubt, think about that. 

[00:16:35.290] - Liz
Yes. Now, I find personally that 20 hours is a good amount of time. It sometimes feels like not enough, but some days it's just you're exhausted, you're done. Like how do you balance sort of the energy levels versus the things you need to do and sort of like juggle, that juggling act? Like, when do you say, well, it's not worth it for me to do today. Can it wait?

[00:16:59.140] - Stephanie
Well, yeah, I mean, again, it's going to depend on the type of business that you have. But I mean if you're doing work for a client and they're on deadline, maybe that can't wait. But if it's you writing content for your social media post next month, that can wait, right? I personally, if I don't have the energy to do something, I won't do anything at all, if it comes to the point of the day. And I know, even if I know that I have to do something, like, for example, write an email that needs to go out tomorrow, sometimes I just won't do it because I know that the energy that I put into it and the way that it will come across, it'll look desperate and it will look like I rushed through it and it won't convert anyway. So, I always like to wait until the next day, ideally in the morning, I'm a morning person, that's gonna work best until I have that energy, right? Because you can tell, you can tell when you're just like you're done and your brain stops working, you know. Like you're just done. And you don't want to force yourself to go through those just to go through the motions to do it, because it's not going to turn out well anyway.

[00:18:03.760] - Stephanie
Just give yourself a break. It's okay.

[00:18:06.560] - Liz
Yeah. Resting is sometimes the most productive thing you can do.

[00:18:09.040] - Stephanie
Absolutely. Yep.

[00:18:11.440] - Liz
Okay. Kind of a follow up to that because you noticed, you mentioned, oh, I got to write my social media content for next month. How far ahead are you focusing on you know the marketing stuff I'm doing today is really for going out a month or next week or how much of it is in real time versus being able to get ahead.

[00:18:29.810] - Stephanie
I always suggest having a 90 day marketing strategy. Now, this does not mean that you have to write your social media posts today for 90 days out. Because as we know, things change in the world, right? I always suggest having a strategy for 90 days and then you can always tweak it. You can move things around, things can change. That's totally fine. But in terms of the actual work that you're doing, I suggest doing that at least. It's hard to say, honestly, because if you're planning a launch, you need to plan that out. Right? A launch needs to be planned out like at least minimum two to three weeks, I would say. Right. But if you're just throwing up a social media post, a lot of people won't agree with me on this. I like to do it at the moment because that's when I feel inspired. I don't like to try to push myself to create content because if I do that, then it comes across as flat, right? What I personally like to do is I will take one day out of the month and create all of my content. But it needs to be a day when I'm inspired to create the content because if I'm not inspired, then I'm not going to do it.

[00:19:36.400] - Stephanie
So, like the scheduled post, I set aside one day and I get all of that content done in 2 hours. That's always my goal. All the content's done in 2 hours. And then like the one off post, like if I'm doing Instagram Reels or if I'm putting something on my stories, I'll just do that in the moment, whatever I feel like. I don't try to force myself to do that you know because it's not going to be fun. Business should be fun.

[00:19:59.890] - Liz
Yes. Yeah. You didn't get into it to just work yourself to death.

[00:20:03.270] - Stephanie
Exactly. Exactly. Yep.

[00:20:06.040] - Liz
Okay, so just kind of recapping some of the things that we talked about is if you want to run a six figure business and not work more than 20 hours a week and maybe even less, right, depending on where you're at and what you're doing.

[00:20:18.160] - Stephanie
I mean I work like 10 hours a week, so, I have clients that work five.

[00:20:23.220] - Liz
Soon to be less.

[00:20:24.040] - Stephanie
Yeah, exactly.

[00:20:25.840] - Liz
Is you need a single offer and not try to spread yourself across a variety of offers and constantly creating new offers. You need to get really good at selling that single offer and focus on marketing that. And those are really the primary things. And marketing obviously can look like a lot of different things. It can look like social media, it can look like list building and email. It can look like ads, it can , you know, can look like guest podcast, spot, whatever is going to work and is the easiest way to reach your ideal customer or client, depending on what your offer is. And then you said to take kind of all the things that are currently on your to do list that are probably just keeping you busy and either delegate, eliminate, or automate. I think that's really like the primary. Like, if you don't get anything else out of this session, those are the things you need to walk away with. Fair to say.

[00:21:19.540] - Stephanie
Exactly. That's fair to say, absolutely. And also another thing that pops up with people is once they start working less, it gets really uncomfortable for them because a lot of entrepreneurs are workaholics and they like to add more things to their schedule. So, it's really important to get comfortable with working less because that's why we built businesses in the first place to work less, not to work more than we were working at our nine to five job. So, I noticed that's another little bonus tip that I will add is to know that it's okay to work less and it's okay for you to be comfortable working less, too. That's like a big mindset thing that takes a lot of work, but we'll leave it at that.

[00:22:03.250] - Liz
Yeah. No, I think that's an excellent point, especially because as entrepreneurs, we're always thinking of new ideas and we want to act on them even when we haven't really fully solidified our six figure single offer that we need. You know, so write down your ideas, depending it until you've really gotten everything out of what you already have.

[00:22:22.060] - Stephanie
Yeah, I have a list. I come up with, my husband [inaudible 00:22:24]. I come up with new ideas all of the time. So, now I use ClickUp. So, now I just have a list in ClickUp in my business headquarters where I just write down all of my ideas. And there's probably at least 200 ideas in there right now. Guess how many I've actually used?

[00:22:41.210] - Liz
Two.

[00:22:41.980] - Stephanie
Maybe. Maybe because they're all brilliant ideas at the time.

[00:22:48.110] - Liz
Like bell curve, where it's like you're excited about something and then it drops. You know there's not a phenomenon that I can't pick up the name of, but yeah, you always want that high of the initial start, and so you constantly come up with stuff and then you don't see success with any of it.

[00:23:01.690] - Stephanie
Yeah, well, and I have ADHD, too, so it's like that dopamine hit, gets me so excited and I just want to go out and do all of the things.

[00:23:08.220] - Liz
Yes.

[00:23:08.910] - Stephanie
And then I'm like, you know take a step back. It's fine. The idea is going to be there tomorrow, and then tomorrow I don't care about it.

[00:23:17.510] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah. What I started doing is coming up with ideas for other people, right? I called them and be like, I have this great idea for you.

[00:23:23.820] - Stephanie
That's what I should do. I should just charge people and come up with ideas for them. Just like brainstorming sessions, because not a bad idea. I'll add it to my list.

[00:23:34.390] - Liz
We're setting a terrible example.

[00:23:36.000] - Stephanie
I know.

[00:23:36.910] - Liz
Okay, so I think all that was fantastic. Where else can people find you? You know what do you want to tell them? Final words?

[00:23:45.710] - Stephanie
Yeah. So, the best place to find me is on Instagram. My handle is at theblakecollective, and that's also my website, thebakecollective.com. And I have a free Facebook group if you want to come, join me there. It's called confidence CEOs. You can get that on my website as well. But I have a free gift for everybody as well, if you are interested in working these 20 hours or less weeks, it's called the 20 hours roadmap, and it breaks down the seven necessary steps that you need to take in order to work 20 hours or less a week. And then I also give seven of the biggest mistakes that I see people making that's holding them back. And I actually don't know if we talked about any of those in here, now that I think about it.

[00:24:26.200] - Liz
Do you want to cover one or two real quick?

[00:24:28.560] - Stephanie
Yeah, I can talk about one of them, but the roadmap, you can get it at 20hourroadmap.com.

And the links are all below. Perfect.

[00:24:36.460] - Stephanie
Yes, perfect. So one of the biggest things that I see people doing is undercharging. So that's probably the biggest one, undercharging for anything that they're creating, whether they're doing it done for you service, whether they have a course, whether they're doing one on one coaching and consulting. Far too many people are undercharging, and it's holding them back from reaching that six figure year, and it's just requiring them to do more work. So, more work in terms of marketing to sell a course, for example, more work in terms of taking on more one on one clients. It all comes back to raising your rates, but raising your rates in a way that's strategic, which also comes back to that six figure signature offer, right? Because you need to make sure it's a scalable offer, and a lot of the time, people's offers are not. So that's one little sneak peek preview from the mistakes there. But, yeah, definitely time for every single person watching this to raise your rates. 100%.
