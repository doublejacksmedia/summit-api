Hello. My name is Jesenia and I am a lead support specialist at Media Vine. And today, I'm going to share some tips and information to help you optimize your existing content for maximum earnings.

[00:00:27.850] - Jesenia
So, you're going to want to check your top performing post, find what content to focus on and break it down. And how you're going to do that is by looking at your Google Analytics, you're going to want to see what's driving readers to your site, whether your goal is to increase earnings or traffic. Learning what content your audience is looking for when they visit your site is going to be the key to your site's growth. You can also find information and search console. Again, see what's bringing readers to your site.

[00:00:55.920] - Jesenia
What are you ranking for? You can also do this by going to your Media Vine dashboard. If you have Media Vine ads on your site, from there, you can check what are your top performing pages? Which pages are earning you the most money and see what your readers are looking for? You can also check in Pinterest.

[00:01:15.210] - Jesenia
You can see what your top performing pins are. If you do get a lot of Pinterest traffic. And again, just see what your site is trending for. If you do decide to look at your Google Analytics account, there's a wealth of information there that goes beyond just the number of sessions and traffic sources. For example, you can check out on their pages and see what your, you know the reader behavior is.

[00:01:39.060] - Jesenia
So you would just go under behavior site content and from there you can check the top pages and then you can also add some. You can actually get some more detailed information from your readers by adding some secondary dimensions, so you can see where they're coming from, what devices they're using when they visit your site, and much more. So again, find out how your readers are getting to your site, determine what's driving them there, what content, and use this information to create future content and or update existing content. This information is going to help you gauge what your current trends are and what future trends are for your site. And check often.

[00:02:21.450] - Jesenia
Check your trending content. Often you might not realize that an old post is trending, but it's missing images or video, or maybe it doesn't have information that's relevant anymore. So, always check. I always say check weekly or monthly and sometimes even daily. If you notice that you're having a spike in traffic, find out why. It could be an old post that was shared on another site.

[00:02:47.960] - Jesenia
It might be that it's suddenly trending on Google. Look at it and see why are the readers going to your site and also make sure that the post is well optimized and it's also current. And when promoting your content, make sure that you're following the money. What is the post that's making you the most money right now? What's making the most money either from ads, affiliate income, if you're selling products or offering a service.

[00:03:14.980] - Jesenia
Those are the content that you're going to want to promote, especially like if you're promoting on Facebook. If you're promoting on a social platform and you're boosting these posts, that's what you're going to want to put your dollars behind. And again, look at the previous year and see what content was trending before. Odds are it will probably trend again the next year and also focus on the present.

[00:03:39.970] - Jesenia
What is driving readers today to your site and see how that can help you prepare future content, you know. One of the things that you can do with this information is help you prepare your content calendar, create your marketing plans, and also just help you focus on what you want to market to your audience.

[00:04:04.270] - Jesenia
So, you're going to want to track your progress and growth. Use a spreadsheet. You can use Google Docs or Air Table and you're going to want to add your top performing posts. You can do this by views, or you can do this by the posts that are making you the most money. So you choose which ones you want to track, or you can do both and Mark down what changes you're making.

[00:04:25.640] - Jesenia
And when you're making those changes. You want to make sure that you have something to look back on and gauge what the actual growth was. So, you're going to want to, for example, if you make a small change and which is what we actually suggest, don't make any major changes. Just make a few small changes at a time. You're going to want to revisit that and see okay, did I have any progress? Did it make a difference and then go and make the next change and that's going to help you see how you're gradually, you know whether it's increasing more engagement or if you're getting more sessions to that particular post, or perhaps you're getting readers to stick around a little bit longer.

[00:05:08.370] - Jesenia
So, now the bounce rate is lower. Those are the things that you're going to want to track and when so that way you know whether or not these changes are having any effect. Basically, your progress is going to be gradual. So that's why it's a good way to track things.

[00:05:24.320] - Jesenia
They're not going to happen overnight. Long content is King. We suggest that you write at least 300 to 500 words. This is going to help with engagement. This is going to help with SEO.

[00:05:37.690] - Jesenia
Another way to do this is by adding images varying sizes. But we do suggest that you use verticals when possible, that's going to actually add more length to the page. Also, make sure that the images are full sized so that they are the same width as your content and space them throughout the post. For example, instead of writing maybe all of your content and then adding all of the images of each step kind of weave in some of the content between the images. So, it's just nicely spaced out. It just visually appears a lot nicer, but it's also just going, again to add that length to the content and not have readers skipping over all of your images because they're all stacked after each other.

[00:06:21.970] - Jesenia
You're also going to want to focus on keeping your audience engaged. Make sure your most valuable content is the last thing that they see. Again, we want the long content to be there because it helps, but most importantly, you want it to be valuable to your readers. Think about your audience, what's keeping them engaged? What are they there for?

[00:06:46.780] - Jesenia
Are they there for video? Are they there for a printable? Are they there for a recipe? So, make sure that that valuable content is not at the top of your post. Once they get that, they're likely going to leave.

[00:06:59.550] - Jesenia
So, let's keep them engaged. Let them read your content in its entirety so that they can get all the tips and tricks and things that you wanted to share with them and then put that valuable content at the very end. Don't assume that you know what the readers want, and say, here it is. Let them actually see everything and then give them that valuable content.

[00:07:22.890] - Jesenia
At the very end of the post. You can lend in your content by increasing the font size and the line height. If you're not sure what yours is currently, you can actually do that by going to Chrome and using the developers tool, and that will give you that information. We suggest that it's at least 16 Pixel or higher. And again, for your line height 1.5 M or more, and you can actually check out our blog and YouTube channel.

[00:07:48.030] - Jesenia
We have tons of tips on how to do this and what our recommendations are on this particular topic. You also want your paragraphs to be one of three sentences and the reason why a lot of your readers are going to be viewing your content on mobile. So, you don't want those very large paragraphs that perhaps don't look so long on desktop to appear over multiple screens on mobile. Again, add images. If you don't have a lot of images, people are visual. People want to see images.

[00:08:21.200] - Jesenia
People want to see video. Again, add video, write more words. But again, make sure it's valuable content. Don't just add words to add words and something that's very important and a good way to also not just add length to your content, but increase reader engagement, is to pull reader feedback into the post. So, an easy way to add length to your content is answering frequently asked questions or including reader feedback or tips that are shared with you in the comments section or via email.

[00:08:52.170] - Jesenia
So, pulling that reader feedback into the post is a great way not only to add length to your content, but also increase reader engagement. And view your site on mobile. The majority of readers and users are viewing a lot of the online content on their mobile devices, sometimes on tablet, and there's still a few on desktop. And it also depends obviously, on your specific site. If you have an educational site, you probably have more desktop readers. But again, assume that most of your readers are looking at your content on mobile.

[00:09:28.920] - Jesenia
You can view this data on analytics and Google Analytics, so you can see if that's where they're coming from, but the majority will probably be on a mobile device. So, when you're doing optimizations, it's super important that you're looking at mobile because that's where your readers are. When editing content on desktop, use the Developers tool to view the mobile version of your post. As bloggers, we tend to view our content on desktop, but you're going to want to see what your readers are seeing. And again, bite size content is going to be easier for them to digest on those mobile screens, since it's a lot smaller.

[00:10:00.650] - Jesenia
And if you can see here even that second paragraph, that's just one sentence. So, when we say one or three sentences, this is why, because it's going to appear much larger on that smaller mobile screen. Don't make it easy for your readers to leave. Assess which buttons and links offer the most value to your readers and to your site. Keep the print button in the recipe card.

[00:10:26.410] - Jesenia
If you are a food blogger, don't give your readers a reason to leave your site immediately. Keep that button down in the recipe card. Once they print it, odds are they're going to leave. So, anything of value again, put it down at the bottom of the page at the end of the post. Don't give it to them at the very beginning.

[00:10:48.710] - Jesenia
Don't make the assumption that that's what they want, because again, it's not easy to get the reader to your site. Don't give them a reason to leave quickly. You don't need multiple variations of a social share button. If you already offer a Pinterest button or a Facebook Share button, you don't need multiple ones throughout the site. Figure out where you want to place that.

[00:11:12.940] - Jesenia
Leave it there. You don't need to add one on the side, on the top, in between. Just choose one and stick to that and also use a heat map tool and post with a higher bounce rate to see how readers are engaging with the content. Why are they leaving so quickly? Are they leaving at the beginning of the post?

[00:11:32.360] - Jesenia
Are they leaving because they're clicking on an external link? Find out what's going on and try to eliminate that roadblock so that you can keep those readers around a lot longer. One thing is that readers spent a short amount of time viewing a site, so sometimes it's just seconds. So, you want to eliminate any reason to have them leave your site. The ultimate goal is to keep them engaged for as long as possible.

[00:12:00.600] - Jesenia
And again, we want to keep readers on your site because whether you have ads or you're doing affiliate links or you're offering a product or a service, you want to maximize your earnings. The way to do that is to keep them on your site as long as possible. So, link to your own content. Spread those links throughout the post, not just as a roundup at the very end. If you're talking about a particular topic and you're mentioning a specific recipe or you're mentioning a specific resource, and you have this resource on your site, make sure to link it within the actual content and use good anchor text.

[00:12:42.260] - Jesenia
Link those keywords and be very strategic about your external links. It's okay to use them if they are adding value to your content. But make sure that you're not inserting all of those that say at the very beginning of the content and having your readers leave immediately because they already found something else they want to look at. So, be very strategic with those and make sure that you're using those that are offering value to your readers and not just inserting them and potentially losing a portion of your audience because of it. And you're also going to want to enable grow that me, which is one of Media Vine plugin and the related content feature, is going to be a great way to allow your readers to save those favorite pages. And it's going to recommend content to them that's based on their browsing activity versus just showing them content.

[00:13:42.670] - Jesenia
That's about the same subject. So, it's a great tool to keep again, those readers around a lot longer invaluable content is key. Keywords matter. We also suggest that you avoid any problematic words.

[00:14:00.150] - Jesenia
Keep a PG, target your audience and also follow the trends, holidays, viral content. If you again are noticing that you're suddenly trending for something that maybe you weren't trending for before, see where that audience is coming from. And use that for any future content that you're going to share with the audience to share with your readers. Content rules. At the end of the day, yes, you want to have a well optimized post. You want to have well optimized content, but you want to ensure that what you're offering your reader is valuable and that's going to keep bringing them back.

[00:14:40.640] - Jesenia
And it's also going to help you rank as well because Google is going to keep showing your particular post or your particular content to those readers that you're seeking. And also how to increase impressions. We haven't discussed necessarily anything ad specific, but if you are running ads, just make sure that again you insert vertical images at a hard return between pictures and text. This is going to help with those ad placements. Embed post specific videos on pages that are trending. Try to increase time on the page on your site.

[00:15:16.020] - Jesenia
The longer that readers are there, the longer that they're engaged, the more ad impressions you're going to receive. Again, grow me. Use the Recommended Post feature, increased font size to 18 pixels. We recommend at least 16, but again, depending on your site, it might be higher, line height of 1.5. Check impressions per page on top ten to 20 posts.

[00:15:42.070] - Jesenia
Look for anything that might be a roadblock. What could be driving those readers out? Again, you can do this by using a heat map tool, so if they're leaving the page at a certain point, use this information so that you can remove those roadblocks. And also, you can do this with posts that are doing really well and see what is working for your site and use that when you're creating future content and replicate it with those. And set clear goals.

[00:16:11.510] - Jesenia
More importantly, just do one thing at a time, but just make sure that it's not a one and done thing. Blogging the marathon is not a sprint. Don't get discouraged if you make changes and you don't see results right away. That's why it's so important for you to track your progress. You may not realize that all these little actions are leading to something bigger and a year from now, you may realize that suddenly your engagement is up way higher.

[00:16:39.000] - Jesenia
Bounce rate is low. Your sessions are double. But again, you're not going to notice that immediately. So, make sure that you're tracking things and then tackle one or two posts a week. You know you can start with your top performing pages based again on views or what's making you the most money.

[00:16:58.320] - Jesenia
So, you decide you know  which way you want to go and just work on those and do a little bit at a time, but do it continuously. Don't just one and done and then forget about it for a few months. Just make it a habit to always revisit your content and make sure that everything, even create a checklist for yourself to make sure that certain things that you want to make sure are on the post, whether it's images, videos, recommended content, et cetera, that those things are in place and just keep coming back. There's always going to be work to do. But the biggest thing is that by increasing traffic to your site and just building your online presence, you're going to be able to reach a larger audience.

[00:17:44.460] - Jesenia
And at the end of the day this is going to convert either to more ad revenues or sales depending on what your goal is and you want to provide great information. I mean, we know that that's the goal and you want to connect with your readers. But the bottom line is that you also want your business to make money and that's what you want to be able to do with all of this. So, just set those goals, revisit them and constantly take action and that's going to pay off in the end. And thank you for your time.
