All right, guys. I'm really excited to have this speaker back. I always love it when she agrees to be part of the summit because she always brings so much value and so much just energy. That is... It makes me happy. So she is the host of the Do the Brave Thing online business podcast. It's her soul and her soul's mission to put money in the hands of good with people so they can do good with it while eradicating the idea that nice people always finish last in business. She shares spam or face-free sales techniques that even your grandma would be proud of you for using. A big warm welcome back to Kate Doster. Kate, thank you so much for coming back again.

[00:00:41.860] - Kate Doster
I am super excited to be here. I absolutely love the events that you put on. They're so amazing. And the Swag bag and the All Access Pass, you always go all out, which is why any time I see that you're doing one, I'm like, Can I be in it?

[00:00:54.890] - Liz Stapleton
And the answer is always yes. I'm excited. We're going to talk about A few different things today. We're going to talk about email trends because there's always shiny things that people are chasing after, strategies or whatever that I want to be like, what's working now versus what is foundational needs to say. Then we're also going to talk about some sales mindset stuff, which I think is always a bigger hurdle than people realize. Let's start with what with email marketing has evolved most over the last couple of years. How has it changed?

[00:01:30.960] - Kate Doster
I think that how it's changed is a little bit... It goes more into sales of the buyer cycle. There used to be a time back in 2020, 2019, 2018, where you could put together essentially an auto webinar funnel, slap together four emails, and you could sell $2,000 courses every single day, every single day. That would be what's considered a front-end offer. Just immediately go into it and it would work so well. Now, people, regardless of industry, while they are still buying stuff, it is a much longer buyer cycle. It might be one of those things for people that have been, I know it's a more advanced tactic, but if they have been using the traditional automated webinar system, they might not be seeing that return on investment like they used to have and be like, Well, why isn't this converting? Well, everyone is starved for time. Everyone is starved for attention, regardless of what industry you're in. Especially if you're in B2B, everyone knows what's coming. So you would need to make sure that that is actually spectacular. When you're thinking of it, it's like, yes, you can still have one on the front-end. We still one on the front-end, just in case if people want to sign up for it anytime when it's available.

[00:02:35.170] - Kate Doster
But it's about thinking like, okay, maybe I should get some people with their foot in the door first, whether it is through a freebie that is a PDF or maybe just like, A traditional mini course. You can have videos, not have videos, not necessarily a hard pitch, 90-minute webinar because people just aren't going to sit through them like they used to. Then it's like, Okay, can you get them into that next step of that live masterclass? Or of that automated webinar system that you have set up. So that's the thing that you're thinking of. Another thing to just really think about is just being authentic with people. And I know we're going to talk about this later, but about not being afraid to remind people about the stuff that you have to actually offer. And so, yes, you're going to have to talk about stuff more, not only more than you used to, but you are going to have to bring up stuff more often. And again, I don't want to say that it takes necessarily a little bit more work, but it's just that you need to have a a lot more of you, which I know we've always encouraged.

[00:03:33.470] - Kate Doster
And it's like, she who knows her audience best is going to win. So you want to make sure that the content that you're sending people really does speak to those aspirations, those objections, those pain points, and that they just don't sound like generic bull crap. They're very, very specific.

[00:03:49.850] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like that. Okay, so that's really a point, and it has me rethinking my webinar. But okay, so that's because attention spans are so short. But what's some foundational strategies that work just as well now as they did five years ago? What should people really make sure they've foundationally set because it continues to work?

[00:04:12.580] - Kate Doster
I think that making sure that, and I will say this odd, but making sure that things make sense together. Say that you do want to put together a freebie, again, regardless of what medium it is, that ultimately it's going to lead either to a smaller product or a bigger product, so they just make sense together. And that's one thing that I've always talked about, especially, say, if you're going to sell on your thank you page because those still work, the tripwire concept, it still does. You can't have a freebie that's a Pinterest free mini course, and then you're trying to sell a Pinterest course immediately right after because people are going to think my Pinterest course already got solved. Where it's like, okay, so I still want this front-end Pinterest mini course because I want people to be able to see me and hear me and all this other stuff. It's like, well, in order to make Pinterest work, you do at this stage of the game, you need to have a lot of content. Here are 100 printable templates for seven bucks, right? It's like this can work really well. And that has always been the case is that you need to think to yourself like, okay, what would that next step be?

[00:05:13.600] - Kate Doster
And you might not have all the steps built. I think that's where people get jumbled up. It's like, Oh, well, I don't know what freebie to have. It's like, I don't know what lower ticket to offer. I don't have a big ticket offer. Now, calm down, calm down. Go ahead and you can just go ahead. What piece do you have already? It's like you might not have, say, that lower ticket offer yet or even the higher one, but you're going to start with the people or the problem that you ultimately want to solve, and you're going to create a freebie around that. Then when you do have that smaller offer, you can pitch it to everyone who's already on your list. You want to do it at an intro level or a flash a level price, you can go ahead and then put it up to what it normally is at and then add it into your welcome series, add it into your funnels. Those things can work really well. I think that sometimes we just forgot. I also think- Overcomplicate it. Yeah. You don't necessarily need to overcomplicate it. I also think that there is great value, just like there's always been in showing up, if you can, weekly.

[00:06:15.220] - Kate Doster
If you miss a week here and there, it's not the end of the world. I don't want to be like, Oh, man, I missed last Thursday. My whole month is shot. Just go ahead and send the email. Just go ahead and send it.

[00:06:27.210] - Liz Stapleton
They're thinking more about it than they're thinking about it.

[00:06:30.450] - Kate Doster
Exactly. They're not being like, Oh, my goodness, it's Thursday. I mean, you might have some super fans, but no one's going to be like, Oh, you sent me an email on a Tuesday instead of last Wednesday. They're just going to be like, Oh, okay, whatever. I think that we always think that people are watching us a lot closer than we actually are. I think, again, just showing up. Really, regardless if you have a personal brand or even, say, a company, I think because everyone, like I said, is really thinking about where their dollars are at, really being able to build that personal connection is huge, which is why I'll still tell my students or I'll even tell the contributors in my bundle, Put your face in your emails. Occasionally, just send a video. Can we send that? Can we just made a loom if you don't feel like particularly typing that day. Just give them something so they can hear you and they can see you and they can put a name to the face.

[00:07:21.620] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, I like that. I'm guilty of not doing that as well because I do the summit. Then I think last year, I think I only taught the implementation implementation sessions. So I feel like there was a little bit like, Who's this lady? And it's like, Oh, no, I hosted the whole thing. But yeah, so I think that's why it didn't panel, I guess. But okay. All right, moving on because we're going to try to cover a lot. So as you touched on already, we need to be more sales minded, in a sense, without being gross, but attention span are down. So are plain text emails the way to go? Visual branded templates. What How do you actually get attention in the inbox? What's working?

[00:08:04.160] - Kate Doster
I think that you can try out a variety of things. I think that people just think like, Oh, once I do this one thing, I'm stuck on pigeon hole forever. You can try just doing a text-based email. I will say if you're going to do primarily text-based, which is what I do. I don't necessarily use templates per se. Make sure there is still something visual in it. There can be a button, that's fine. I love having pictures, especially say, even if you're trying to... You have to sell the click regardless if you're going to free or paid. I think that people forget that. If you're sending people to a blog post or to a podcast episode, actually put a mockup of what that blog post looks like. Again, take a screenshot, go over to Canva, shove it in there, put that image in there. People love clicking on pictures. Make sure that picture is linked so that way it's going wherever it's going. Because if people just see walls of text, you're 100% correct, they're just going to phase out. But again, you can start a gift in there, just something in the middle to feel like, okay.

[00:09:00.430] - Liz Stapleton
Make it skimmable, use bold. It's spacing. There's this one person that I'm on their email list and I'm about ready to unsubscribe because I never read their emails. I open it, I'm like, Okay, there's that big header image, and then everything else is just text. I'm like, what is this even about? I can't at a glance tell. It's driving me nuts. I'm tempted to email back and be like, Could you just... But it's not my business like this. It's their business.

[00:09:22.600] - Liz Stapleton
I don't want to do unwarranted thoughts because maybe someone else absolutely loves it like that.

[00:09:27.440] - Liz Stapleton
Everyone's different.

[00:09:28.540] - Kate Doster
I think Yeah, making it skimmable. I think that people think that, Oh, I either have to, and this is one of the things we were talking about before we hopped on, Oh, you either have to run a flash sale with a discount or you have to do a big Amy Porterfield style launch multiple days, eight gajillion emails, 12 webinars, private podcast, all that. Those are the only two ways to make a sale. I think that you forget you can just casually talk about your products and services in your actual emails. Technically, you could talk about the same thing every single week in a completely different way. It could be one of those things. Say you have a mastermind that has open enrollment. Chances are somebody in there is asking you a question about something. That can be a theme of one of your emails. The other day, I was chatting with Patty in your super awesome mastermind. It's just the name and you're just going to link it. Again, I think people forget that all the best practices that you use and say blog post, you can use an email. You know how you hyperlink to related things?

[00:10:30.250] - Kate Doster
Hyperlink to related things. You don't necessarily always have to have a call to action to be like, Come here to check out our amazing mastermind. Again, you have the name, Sally. You have her question. If you have a screenshot of that question, even better, you can shove it in there. And guess what? You can make that clickable because people love clicking on pictures. Answer the questions and now everybody knows what's going on. And then you have a choice. Do you want your call to action after, again, you answered Sally's question in your email and to her in your group? You can have the call to Have you ever felt this way when it comes to trying to get your house clean? Hey, reply and let me know if you want to build more connection. If not, you can have a call to action because they still work. And if you are also tired of getting hit in the face with cereal boxes because it turns out that the Sock Gremlin isn't actually the thing that's holding you down because maybe Sally's question was about socks, then we would love to have you inside of the Mastermind.

[00:11:25.040] - Kate Doster
We do these weekly calls. Again, you can talk about it a lot. There are simple ways to to casually sell your list where you'll see this now it's become really popular. I do think that it works for what I like to call McDonald's money. I don't think that it's necessarily going to net you thousands and thousands of thousands unless your list is huge. But at the bottom of your email, you can have a little bit of what I'm working on section. It's usually the three things that you've got going on. I was like, Oh, so you can have whatever your email is about, things that are working. Oh, I just recorded a new lesson for the mastermind. Again, a little talk about it, click over here. They can go to there. You can talk about an affiliate offer. They can go over there. All those sorts of things. You can casually remind people about the stuff that you have. Occasionally, we'll send out one of whatever the top sellers were that week. We'll have a top seller section. It just depends on what we feel like. Now, if you were doing a giant launch, obviously, you wouldn't shove in these other little micro sales things, micro reminders, but it can just work really well.

[00:12:28.810] - Kate Doster
Again, you can relate it to anything. Again, I think people think they can talk about a product if they're launching it or if there's something special going on. No. Especially if you have something seasonal and even not seasonal, just any reason to talk about it, talk about it.

[00:12:43.510] - Liz Stapleton
Guys, talk If you guys are watching this and you are on my email list in the fall, you will probably have seen, Oh, hey, I just recorded a session for the summit with Kate Doster. Oh, I just finished editing six different sessions, and this is what my takeaways were. You're going to see, you would have seen that. If you weren't and you continue to be on my list come next fall when I am prepping for the next summit, you will see that too. Because it's just pulled from every day. That's great. That takes me to my next question of being personal about it. But a lot of people are using AI for everything. I feel like I'm not seeing it so much in the email marketing space. Although I will say I do use it to draft my podcast promo emails. But I'm just curious, your thoughts on AI in the email marketing space. To what extent do you use it? To what extent would you use it? Where is it too much?

[00:13:43.340] - Kate Doster
I think that it probably is, but we don't run in those circles. We're not really bro-y. I guarantee you there's a bro person who also loves private selling rights with affiliates on affiliates on affiliates, clickbank people that are just like,. But that's just not our style. Again, people can see through that. I think that sometimes we forget that. The way that I, and I call him Chad because your girls got dyslexia, so sometimes ChatGPT, the letters get mixed up. So we're like, Who's Chad? Who is she talking about? It's Chad. I like to have Chad up. What I always tell my students, I have a mini course about this too, is to use it when you hit your stumbling block. So what part of your newsletter is tripping you up? That's just like red stop sign it. If you can't think of a subject line, then be like, Hey, Chad, I want to write an email about who's going to help blank. What are four different subject lines that I can use? They're under eight words, go. And then it's like, Okay, so now he's given it right. If you already have that email written because maybe you saved the subject lines for last.

[00:14:51.540] - Kate Doster
Put that in there. Yeah. Put the email in there. Like, Hey, Chad, based on this email, pretend that you are an email marketing expert. Give me, I wouldn't say 15, but analysis, analysis, give me eight subject lines with different formats that are going to get people to open it. Some of the ways that I will write it because I am such a talker-

[00:15:11.590] - Liz Stapleton
Sometimes I combine two or three of the answers I get. Yeah.

[00:15:15.050] - Kate Doster
And because I've got the ADHD and I tend to be an over-explainer, I am the exact opposite of concise. My friend Becky Beach, very concise. My friend Jess from Jess Creatives, super concise. Not your girl at all. I am very, very wordy. So sometimes, especially if it's directions, I will take whatever Kate is in my half, and then I will ask it, make this paragraph more concise. Or if it's one of those I do, sometimes I have my assistant proofread stuff, sometimes I'll have my Mac to voice to text back to it, but sometimes I will put it in chat and be like, Can you proof this for me? And so he'll make sure if I forgot the word and somewhere or if I put the wrong version of your in there, then he's going to change it over.

[00:15:53.710] - Kate Doster
So it's like, okay, it's just this little polishing touches. Or if you're just like, I really I don't want to say, Click here to join the mastermind. That just seems very blah, right? Then you can ask it. I would never... This is just me personally, and I feel like a lot of my people also feel it's really disingenuous. I would never be like, Hey, I want to promote my mastermind today. Write an email about it. The only time that I use Chad to say, Write a promotional style of email, is if it's going to some type of contributor or an affiliate, because most of those, they have to be pretty generic, everyone's style. Now, for example, at the time of this recording, because we're recording a little bit early, we're running a Halloween-themed event. One of the swipe files of emails that I wrote was very Halloween punny. But I made sure that everyone's going to get their brand to say that this is spooktacular and it's a business boosting resource. It's like, they're not all going to want to say that. It's like, Okay, can you write a more straightforward, here are the big details of the event, here's what's going on.

[00:16:57.730] - Kate Doster
That way it's like, oh, okay. Then you I take the email. I never just cut and paste it into a Google Doc. I'm always going to go ahead and alter it, still put my own flavor on there, but I'm not starting at zero. So I think that that is a really good place to start. Or if you're like, say you don't hang out with myself or a friend of everyone, Liz Wilcox. We love Liz as well.

[00:17:18.720] - Liz Stapleton
She's also speaking at the summit.

[00:17:21.120] - Kate Doster
If you don't know what to say, and I don't know if she's talking about welcome series, then now she'll talk about welcome series. But say for some freak reason, you didn't have my templates for a welcome series. You didn't have Liz's templates for a welcome series. Then you're going to be like, Okay, so I want to create a four-part Welcome Series. Here's some of the topics. What topic should I put in there? Again, sometimes it's going to be garbage, but sometimes, just like you said, it's going to spark an idea. That is where I would use AI. I would never have AI be like, Hey, can you write me a seven-part launch sequence for this course? It targets this. Here's an excuse. Go. Because I guarantee you, four or five of those emails are going to say the exact same thing. Just with the different amount of rocket emojis that it seems to show in there.

[00:18:04.950] - Liz Stapleton
I'm like, Don't add emojis.

[00:18:08.170] - Kate Doster
Yes, I have to tell no exclamation points. Something that is, I guess it's creepy, but I'm like, It's just the way It is. Sometimes, if you've been on the internet for as long as we have, you can pretend you're, and I can be like, In the style of Kate Doster, this is me writing it. It's like, Write it. Sometimes it's ridiculously far off. Sometimes I just think it's funny and I want to see. I'm like, I don't ever use exclamation points. What are you doing? Where are you scraping this from the internet that you think that you can find these things? But it can be fun that way. Again, if you wear, where are you stuck? Again, call it action. Is it subject lines?

[00:18:46.160] - Liz Stapleton
It's my go-to for avoiding blank pages.

[00:18:49.140] - Kate Doster
That's 100% can help you out. It's just like, Oh, all right. Thanks. Same thing, again, I'm sure we have other people talk about it, too. With blog posts or outlines of content as well, it can be that. Like you had said, I use it all the time for show notes, especially if I have interviews, I get the transcription from River.

[00:19:09.930] - Liz Stapleton
Repurposing transcripts with AI is like...

[00:19:13.200] - Kate Doster
Can you summarize this? Sometimes, I always have my notes for my calls. Sometimes I'll make sure I put in there. Sometimes I'll pick out boring things. I'm like, What? That was great. But again, it alleviates that thing. I want you to ask yourself, Why aren't I emailing your list? We talked about a lot of mechanical things. I don't have any ideas. I don't know how to word this. I don't know how else to talk about this product. But if the issue is that you are scared or embarrassed, then Chad's not going to help with that. You have to think to yourself, people are excited to read my emails. Are you going to have some people that are just going to be like, Oh, my inbox is too full? Yeah, but they probably were never going to buy from you ever. But I always like to think because people go to their inbox for a distraction. They're going for a dopamine hit. I'm like, I want to be that dopamine hit for that person. So they'll learn when my name pops up, I don't even have to worry about the subject line anymore because they're just going to be like, Oh, it's Kate, and they're just going to see what's going on.

[00:20:08.070] - Kate Doster
And that's where we all want to go. And you get by that by building that personal connection, by showing up consistently. Again, it does not need to be every day. It does not need to be twice a week. Sometimes it can be text-based. Sometimes you can do a newsletter style. You can mix it up. You're the boss. Don't forget that. It's okay.

[00:20:26.770] - Liz Stapleton
All right. I want to go back to something you said. You just said, They're probably not going to buy I'm going to get away from you anyway. Scrubbing your list. I feel like I have over scrubbed in recent years, and so I'm trying to... Instead of doing quarterly, maybe just twice a year, do you still scrub your list? How often are you doing it? What is your viewpoint on scrubbing a list?

[00:20:46.830] - Kate Doster
I think that it can be really smart. I think it can be really painful for people because they're like, I spent so much time, and it's a vanity number that people perceive as not a vanity number because I was like, Oh, you make $42 per this and all that stuff when it comes to email. But it's one of those things. If you have, and I don't want to call people dead weight because they are people, but if you have a lot of people that aren't-

[00:21:11.510] - Liz Stapleton
You're paying for them.

[00:21:12.890] - Kate Doster
Or they aren't interacting with your stuff, not only are you paying for them, but it's dragging down your reputation. I don't know how... Because somebody asked me, I don't know how things like Gmail and Outlook know your send a reputation because everyone gets one, but they do. They're going to know. It's going to help. Is this person going in to spam more often? All of us usually get into promotions. Are you going into promotions? Are you going into update? There's a whole thing called deliverability, which is really techy, so we won't get into that thing. Having all those people on your list can do it.

[00:21:46.090] - Kate Doster
But here's the other aspect of it. Say if you have 20,000 people on your list, but 5,000 just aren't really... They're not really doing much. And you're like, Oh, my open rates are in the tank. They're awful. Math, everyone. Open rates are a ratio. So if you get rid of those 5,000 people that aren't interacting, that don't want to stay around, and we'll talk about getting rid of them in a second. If now you're only sending, say, 10,000 people, say we start at 15 for that example, and you're getting literally the same amount of people opening because now your ratios are different, now your open rates are up, now your click-through rates are up, you automatically helped that metric because you're talking about it. I don't necessarily just automatically delete people.

[00:22:28.870] - Liz Stapleton
No, I tried to reengage first. Yeah.

[00:22:30.980] - Kate Doster
You can set it up. Kit, as they're now called, they do have a code automation. If you just search Kit or Convert Kit cold Subscriber, they have a template that you can use to reput people into it. Now, before they didn't, but now they have a capability where they can just unsubscribe people for you at the end. That way you don't have to worry about it.

[00:22:54.450] - Liz Stapleton
The biggest thing with that, guys, is so huge.

[00:23:00.080] - Kate Doster
The reason why I don't want you just deleting people. On mobile, all of them now, it used to be Android, but Apple is the same way. There is a very hard time for your email service provider who will be able to tell that your email got opened. There is this invisible pixel that gets sent. It's essentially a picture. When the email gets open, it's usually on desktop, unless you have a lot of privacy settings on, which we'll talk about, it pings back to, Kit, oh, Sally opened your email. But if they're on mobile, it usually gets blocked. If it's on Android, it usually gets blocked. Sally could be opening your emails every single week, but for whatever reason, say she's not clicking or she's not replying, because we know those are harder to get for people to get them out of their inbox. You might delete somebody who was in three months.

[00:23:44.160] - Liz Stapleton
That's where I think I've done too much.

[00:23:46.840] - Kate Doster
I make sure when I'm doing that reengagement campaign, I always make sure that first email is just something that I just know people like, like list building stuff. But by the time it's time to get rid of them, Every time it's like, Hey, I don't know if you like these emails or not, so I need you to either click on this link or reply. And if not, that's fine. This will be the last email and we'll get rid of you because it's those actions. So I wouldn't be like, Okay, even on that first email that you know is our crowd favorite, where you have a lot of links for people to click. Maybe some people like to offer a discount code. I don't necessarily teach that, but you might want to. I'd rather reward people that are active, personally. But it's up to you. It's up to If that's how you want to get somebody to get action, but have them reply back with something simple. Not like, Oh, what are you struggling with when it comes to your Facebook ads? Because that's going to take so much. Literally, it's like, And if Facebook has been really piss me off, really, hit reply, just give me a yes.

[00:24:46.800] - Kate Doster
Again, that way people will be more likely to just hit reply and say yes. Now, technically, you can start a conversation with that person, which is awesome. But now your email service provider knows, Oh, oh, For a while, we were keeping people on our list, and you might have done this with the summit as well. We'll give you an option because we run a lot of bundles and even with our products, like, Oh, do you just want product or bundle-based emails? And so not a lot of people checked that box, but some ended up being a couple of thousand. And I'm like, Oh, I need to keep them in here because what if I ever need to reach them again? But then it dawned on me. I'm like, You have all that data other places. And especially for a freebie, like that's fine. But if somebody has paid me money or they're in my Thrive Learn account, they're in my Thrive account, I can always export that list. If I need to tell them that we're moving platforms, that's truly the only thing that I would need to be able to tell them. I can take that.

[00:25:44.400] - Kate Doster
I can upload it to either in Convert kit for that final time, or I have my backup account, which is MailerLite, email them, let them know, Hey, I want to let you know we're moving this account. Don't worry, you haven't been out of my newsletters if you're not already getting them, and then you can delete them afterwards. I'm like, I don't want to say there's no reason to keep those people around, but there's technically- Yeah, I do have a subscriber preference if you only want product updates.

[00:26:09.270] - Liz Stapleton
And they do stay on. But it pays off to scrub it. Like I said, I think I was just a little overzealous doing four times a year. Because I got being like, Why was I ever off your list? But as a result, when you look at kit because they have engagement subscriber scoring and stuff, 70% of my list is at five stars.

[00:26:33.250] - Kate Doster
That's great.

[00:26:34.220] - Liz Stapleton
I feel like others are just... It's important to scrub, but maybe once or twice a year max is what I want.

[00:26:41.730] - Kate Doster
That's what I say. I 100% Again, if you don't have it necessarily always going on in the background, and for a lot of people to be able to set that up, it's a lot less painful for them because I'm like, Oh, I'm getting rid of all of these people. Especially, guys, especially if you don't have it, have double opt-ins, which is 1,000% up to you. But a lot of people that sell on the thank you page, you need to just have a single opt-in because they'll be able to talk to that person again. Especially if you have a single opt-in, I would 1,000% clean your list, regardless of how painful it may be. We usually do ours in December if we needed to do a big one.

[00:27:20.340] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like that. Okay, so moving on. We touched on subscriber preference and privacy. Are you seeing any... Because there's so many more data privacy, people are more aware of what their privacy rights are. Are you seeing any changes or adjustments in that that have been people are like, Why am I on this list?

[00:27:49.980] - Kate Doster
Not really, because I feel like a lot of people know and you should be reminding them and they have all that. I'm wondering for the people that are like, Hey, I I saw that you, you checked out this course. I'm wondering how those particular emails, and again, since I'm not a lawyer and I don't play on TV, I wonder how those work out for people. But it might be one of those things like, Yes. Again, I like to try to teach just simple things. Again, just show up. But yeah, it does make sense if you're seeing that somebody is really engaging with a particular product or really engaging with a thing, maybe they need a little bit of a special email to be able to send them over there. It's like, you can be creepy. Like, Hey, I know you were checking out this is a super awesome summit bundle. And you can say that, but you got to think to yourself, Okay, what objection would somebody have that did it? So maybe it's just like, instead of being like, Hey, I noticed you check this out, it is something like you just send an email to the people that click on that after a couple of days.

[00:28:48.600] - Kate Doster
That's more of a testimonial-based story. It's like, Hey, I want you to meet Susan. And how she did that. Or again, what would somebody have a big objection to when it comes to actually clicking that buy button? For my bundle course, it's like, I got to be like, Hey, I thought you were checking out collaboration caution. It might be like, I don't know. It might be an email about how to be able to make money on a long-term product upfront. Because that is an issue that people can have with summits, with bundles, especially if you're a B2B bundle, they work really well. But you got to pitch people four or five months out because all business owners usually have at least a 90-day plan in their calendar. It's like, I'm putting in all this work and now I'm not going to see the rewards for four or five months, but I need rewards now. I was like, Oh, you just send those people an extra email about those things.

[00:29:45.700] - Liz Stapleton
Absolutely.

[00:29:46.600] - Kate Doster
Okay, next question.

[00:29:48.520] - Liz Stapleton
Do you see any emerging email marketing trends that you think are going to shape how the next year or two in email marketing is?

[00:29:57.000] - Kate Doster
I am going to be really interested in AI. Again, I know the circles that we run into, it's not that big of a deal. But I think everybody is just interested. Again, it's not like things where Google is getting smart enough to be able to tell, Oh, this was an AI written, that a thing. It's not a person, but people are going to be able to tell. I think where I'm really interested, and I feel like this is more online sales than email, but because email is such the backbone of everything, it's really hard to differentiate the two. That's why we talk about both, is like those big launch processes. It's like, are those 15 emails that you're written, are they necessary? Are they actually effective? What is going on there? And again, because most There are still people that are buying those mid $1,000, $2,000 products, but it seems to be under $200 and then $5,000 and up, which is very different between buy-in coaching and those mid-things. I was like, You don't really need that much for something that's $200. I'll be very interested a lot more when people are integrating these casual selling techniques, how they are going to go.

[00:31:11.780] - Kate Doster
I think in the front end of things for list building because everywhere, I want to say everywhere that there's a lot more people out there. Because I was chatting with somebody else about it. I feel like because last year, 2024, was so hard for people, a lot of business owners just folded and left. They just gave up because their sales were down. I don't want to be like, Oh, if you are creating a freebie or lead magazine, it needs to be the absolute best thing ever. I do still think the same principle that I have literally taught since 2019 is the truth. Your freebie still needs to answer a very specific yeah, but that you've got going on. Now, getting eyeballs on it are going to be a little bit harder than it used to be. You can try to play the Instagram algorithm game. I never relied on SEO, but I know that is really hurting with Google having AI results because people just aren't going anywhere because they can just read it on Google. Again, so I think that getting in front of people might be a little bit more challenging. I feel like a lot of people are relying on ads, but I think that it's just...

[00:32:18.740] - Kate Doster
I know it sounds bad, but I just think of that it's fun just to be able to test things out, see what works, what's going on here. Are ads worth over time? Are they actually working? Is there things I like many chats? So we've been playing around with that. I definitely don't think it's worth it for the amount of attraction I actually get on Instagram. But I'm like, I'm willing to play around with it because I just think that it does offer a good user experience for people rather than just being like link in the bio. It's like, do they actually go back to their DMs to get the link that I gave them? Maybe, maybe not. But I think that that could be really interesting to see. Like, okay, how are you pairing those things together? I think that that can be really interesting.

[00:32:58.360] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like it. All right. I know you have something for everyone that's watching this. Can you tell us about it? Sure.

[00:33:06.090] - Kate Doster
If you're like, all right, I do want to casually sell to my list. I know that I need to talk to them. And maybe Chad just is not giving you good ideas on what to chat about. Because I don't know. I tried being like, I teach this and I help that, give me 30 days worth of ideas for, say, Instagram. And it's always just like, Do a Q&A, highlight a customer. I'm like, This isn't getting my brand users going. This isn't going to I have two years worth of email ideas. So these are actually really specific prompts that you can use in sentence letters to be able to write your emails. And if you want to weave in some casual pitching, you can. If you don't want to weave in casual pitching in any other way, you can. You can head over to katedoster.Com/twoyears. Basically, you don't have to worry about it until, what, 2027 at this point? For what do I write this week? Because it's all there. Instead of just being like, Here's two years worth of stuff which is bullet pointed because my brain can't do that. I literally mapped it out like, first week of May, second week of May, fourth week of May.

[00:34:07.810] - Kate Doster
Then I'm like, If you hate these, go to a different month. You can't do National Donut Day when it's not National Donut Day. But you can use some of the other prompts that we have. It's something that's just like, No, this month isn't going to be known for this. I'll let you know. But that works out really, really well. People really enjoy it. It's just something that they can just have on their desktop. They're like, Oh, okay. Definitely Go ahead and do that. I have to say, I do feel, especially if you're writing emails that just have one call to action a couple of different times, which just don't have one link at the bottom, guys. Links stop one thing a bunch of times. I think that those can work really well still on Instagram, Instagram captions. I think you think, Oh, if I'm sending this newsletter to my list, it has to be exclusive to them. It doesn't necessarily have to be exclusive to them. If you're like, Oh, but the only people that follow me on social are the people that are on my list anyways. I don't know if you want to look at your algorithm lately, but only 2% of people are actually seeing your stuff anyways.

[00:35:03.420] - Kate Doster
Usually, people don't act on things the first time anyways. I feel like you can do a lot of really great repurposing with your emails. It just doesn't have to be like, Oh, my goodness, I spent two hours on this. You can use it other places, too.

[00:35:17.580] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, absolutely. All right. That's fantastic, guys. The link is on this page. Kate, thank you again so much for joining me for the summit and sharing your awesome knowledge. You always bring a great perspective and make me think about things. So thank you so much.

[00:35:31.450] - Kate Doster
Thank you so much for having me. And guys, if you didn't get the all access pass, you 1,000% should. Not only because these presentations have just been great. I'm taking all these notes, my hand hurts. But there's some amazing stuff that you're going to get for the creators, too, to be able to just help you take action. Because that's, I think, the biggest thing that Liz and I really preach. It's great for you all to hang out with us, and we love you. Tell us that you're hanging out with us. Send us those messages. Chat in the community. We want to know you all that you're watching this, but we need you to take action. That is the biggest thing. If you are overwhelmed, if you've been having anxiety, the only cure is to do something. You can't learn how to swim by reading a book. You got to get in the water. Just get in the water. And don't put too much pressure on yourself. You're not supposed to be Michael Phelps the first time that you're swimming. Just like when you launch something or your first newsletter, you cannot put all that pressure on a single email, on a single launch.

[00:36:21.540] - Kate Doster
Because just like my friend Faith Mariah says, there's always going to be another one. Yes. There's always another one.

[00:36:25.850] - Liz Stapleton
Also, speaking at the summit, if you guys didn't catch yourself, I don't know where in the schedule it's going to be, but yeah, no. There's always going to be another one. Get in the water, get yourself some floaties in the way of Kate's two years of emails to help you get started, and you'll get there.
