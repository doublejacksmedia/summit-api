She's an international bestselling author, a passionate speaker, recording artist, television featured performing artist, actress, founder, content creator, podcast strategist, mentor coach, and host of the Radiant Pearl Living Podcast and the Fearless Creator Podcast. She enjoys publishing, producing, and sharing amazing resources that will help make a difference in the lives of others. A big warm welcome to Stacy Zant. Stacy, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:40.830] - Stacy
Thank you for having me back. I'm so excited. 

[00:00:44.850] - Liz
Yeah. So, we're going to be talking about streamlining your blog content process, so you can create more productivity and profitability. How would you define streamlined, would be I guess my first question?

[00:00:58.210] - Stacy
Yes, I love that question because just keeping it simple, streamlining is just really allowing things to have a flow that I love to say is organic and that is just going to work in tandem with each other. You think about a river or you think about a stream that is, you know continuing to flow and build on each other to accomplish its goal of movement, movement forward. Right? And so, streamlining is just really being able to keep that momentum and that movement that you need to have happen in your business and as a blogger, go forward in a succinct, clear, concise and beautiful way.

[00:01:49.090] - Liz
I like that. Okay, can you give us like a specific example of how this would work in terms of the blog process?

[00:01:56.470] - Stacy
Yes. So, for myself, I've seen the advantage of having really my contact calendar and I know in the past I've spoken a lot about that, being able to have a system in place that works for me and it looks different for everyone and you have to test and try things. Right. And so for me, I started with the traditional planner and still love that. But having checks and balances with a spreadsheet that not only I can reference, but also team members of mine because there's so many moving parts when you're running a business online and you have blog and you have all the fun things like content creation. Right. And so, for me, just being able to see, okay, I have a schedule and I have structure and that allows things to be simplified and streamlined for myself and those who I work alongside off. So, we can keep creating content consistently. And if there is a rare downtime, we can repurpose that content as well because we know what's ahead and we know what to plan for.

[00:03:04.730] - Liz
Okay, so if someone is trying to figure out sort of their process or their system, where do you recommend they start?

[00:03:13.230] - Stacy
Yeah, so you know how easy it is to have a Google Calendar on your phone and so of course, making it as simple as possible with your handheld device. But if you realize, okay, I need something more, how can you maybe incorporate that spreadsheet in your Google Drive that is still accessible. I love personally working on updating our content calendar, holistically, it's for a whole year that I can see it, and if I want to zoom in for the month, I can, or for the quarter, and that is accessible on my iPad, it's a little bit bigger. So, working your way up and having templates that you can use, so you're not reinventing the wheel and you don't have to look at a blank thing to canvas to try and get creative when you should be putting your creativity in the content that's going to produce the results and the bottom line for your business.

[00:04:15.810] - Liz
Okay, so you mentioned templates. What kind of template? Because template could be a graphic template, it could be a template for this is how we do a review post. Like the variety of templates you can have can vary widely. So what are some examples of templates? And do you have any tips on making sure you know where to find those templates so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle?

[00:04:39.050] - Stacy
Yes. I love that. So, you know one of the biggest things that I love preaching about, and in the past, I've done like the click up template, but having a template within the actual Google Doc, Google Drive, it's so easy to copy, right. When you have a spreadsheet that's already been created that works, and then being able to utilize that plug in your own information that's relevant for your own business, your own blog. And I've heard from so many, have received so much feedback from other fearless creators who said, man, I didn't know how much I needed this. Because you have an idea of what you need to do, but then you may not necessarily know how to go about doing them in the most effective way because you're just getting started or you haven't tested things or tried things. And so, I know there's so many places you can get templates when you just Google and search online. That's how your blog can come up. Right? If you maximize certain elements of SEO and creating the same sort of content, but the same thing when you search for a keyword or utilizing people in the summit.

[00:05:49.510] - Stacy
Right? I know you have templates probably as well, Liz and I myself, and they're gaining access. So, there's so much. Yeah. That you can maximize as a blogger.

[00:06:00.690] - Liz
Okay, that leads me to my next question is how do you evaluate if something is working or not, or if it's kind of working, how you tweak it? Because it's one thing to come up with this process. And I think when we're blogging, we're like, okay, let me sit down, let me think of this process, let me write it all out and let's do it. And then in the reality, it doesn't always work well. So, how are you evaluating it? What are kind of the things you're basing that evaluation on? And how do you fix it if it's not quite working or if it's kind of working?

[00:06:30.910] - Stacy
Yes. This is such a pertinent question because I don't think we do it enough. When we think about just all that it entails in creating the content, getting it out there, then we're like we can now breathe and we just move on to the next thing. But no, you know, research is important. It's not just for those who went to traditional school, it's for everyone who wants to succeed in their business and what they're passionate about doing and producing. And so I found being able to look at the analytics of what it is that you are creating and seeing how it's really creating an effect on your business and it may not be to the bottom line, but it may lead to the bottom line. And one way to know that is getting feedback, right? Having it a part of the structure and automation where when people get a product of yours or a freebie opt in or when they are reading your content, it's blatant right there. Comments, right? That's a feedback way of knowing, okay, if people are really resonating with my content. But giving that call to action and finding ways we've heard of the saying that it takes relatively between 20 to 30 times for a person to be told or to hear something before they actually take action.

[00:07:57.340] - Stacy
So, how many ways are you being creative in saying the same thing over and over again so that people will be able to give you the feedback you need? So, you can know what is measurable, what is working? What you need to tweak, what you need to improve on, so that you can get the results that you're looking for through your content and through your blog piece.

[00:08:20.510] - Liz
Yes, I do like that, call to action. And that I feel it can be sometimes frustrating for people because they don't necessarily have a lot of traffic to base that evaluation on. But the other thing you did mention was automations. And I think in evaluating your process too, if you find that you are constantly having to go look for something like that, a little bit of time adds up. And I think creating automation, so that it's just there can really help. But how do you evaluate the automation that you're using?

[00:08:52.650] - Stacy
Yes, so whenever I have certain opportunities to even partner to get the word out, you know we're doing that already right now with the summit. But when you are looking to create content, maybe your guest posting or your guest teaching, and you have content that complements what you're teaching, don't assume that you know everything. Right? Every audience can be a little bit different and the person who has been building that audience would know best. And so, one of the things that I found that's measurable, even for myself, that led to measurable results that's still yielding dividends today and profits today is sending out a survey to the owner, to the person who has invited me, making it very easy for them to be able to share it with their audience before I come in. And then allowing me to see what their struggles are, what their words are, what is it that they're looking for in terms of content? Because when you're a blogger, you're a content creator, right? So, you want to create that content around meeting their needs. And so that goes in tandem with not just speaking it's all around, because then you can share your knowledge and expertise as well in a blog that you may be posting on someone else's platform or on your own platform.

[00:10:24.310] - Stacy
Right? And so, when you automate, there's a few different survey platforms that are really good with it being so intuitive that all they have to do is literally click a link. And it just takes them through step by step in their email, if they're on your email list or on the other person's email list, if you've made it available to them. So, many great effective ways that I've found to be beneficial to help me, to really get clear on helping the people that I need to help.

[00:10:55.490] - Liz
Yes, I like that. I actually haven't done an audience survey in a long time, and I really should. I might sync that in. I will say, if you guys are struggling with ideas for collaborations, we have a session with [inaudible 00:11:06] where we talk about a ton of different ways you can collaborate with others, because there's probably more ways than you realize. Okay, so the next question I want to ask, because I think it's just as important to learn from people's successes as it is their mistakes. What are mistakes you see people making when it comes to trying to streamline, trying to automate, you know, like what are the mistakes you're seeing?

[00:11:30.910] - Stacy
Yes. I'll even say for myself, getting excited about the shiny new thing. We've heard about the shiny new object, the syndrome there where you just really want to try this new thing. And it may not be the season for it, and it may not really be productive in the time that you have to be able to move the needle forward. And so, really evaluating, taking a step back and being able to say, okay, I'm going to wait on this new shiny thing, or I'm going to test, you knwo, see if I have a little wiggle room in my schedule as to be planning in advance. Right? And being able to look and see for myself, really having a constant time right. Like scheduled in time to be able to think about these things. It's not just once a year or once a quarter, but are you weekly meeting? Sometimes they can be considered a drag, but even if it's a meeting with yourself, being able to look over and see, okay, what can I implement that could work? And do I have space in my schedule, so that it doesn't take away from the things that I'm already doing that I know I need to get done.

[00:12:47.570] - Stacy
And that does work.

[00:12:49.590] - Liz
Yeah, taking a step back, because sometimes, especially when you're a content creator, like, you're so in the weeds because you're right, there are so many moving pieces, there's so much going on. But taking a step back to look at the big picture and you may realize some of the things you're doing actually aren't producing the results you want. So, you can drop them, you know. And so that way you're only doing things you need to, like you said, and you can see, oh, well, this isn't actually working for me, so why don't I drop this? I think this might work better. I'll try it in that spot. So, you're not just adding, adding, adding, adding, adding to the list, which I think a lot of people do with every new thing they learn. The list just gets longer and longer without realizing that it's not actually producing results. So, I think that's a great point to do as frequently as you can, really. If you're starting to feel burned out or like your to do list is never ending, I think that's a great example of it's time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

[00:13:40.070] - Stacy
Definitely, yes.

[00:13:41.990] - Liz
Just want to say, I wholeheartedly agree with that. Besides the shiny new objects, are there any other mistakes you see commonly happening, holding people back?

[00:13:51.690] - Stacy
Yes. You know when it comes to really being able to see the results, there's a lot of times people quit before they really can get the results. And so that's why I always say and have no ted. Whenever you're going to try a new thing or you're going to establish a schedule or routine or something that you've had a desire to build or launch, try it for at least 90 days. And I know that sounds like, oh, my word, 90 days, three months, or just giving yourself grace and time to be able to put the information out there. Get it in front of enough people, and still in the grand scheme of things, that's not enough time. When you're planning an event, you know this as a host rate of a summit. And when you have a business that is continually putting out invaluable content, you recognize that there sometimes isn't enough time in the day to get all of the marketing components after you created the actual content and the product. So, really giving yourself that grace and that time to test things. And I've seen a lot of people, they don't do that. They see, oh, right away within the first week.

[00:15:09.000] - Stacy
Oh, no response. There's crickets or there's just not the results that they wanted. And they just needed to push forward a little bit longer. They needed to tweak some things, they needed to get the word out some more, just so that they will be able to see what really lands and works.

[00:15:26.230] - Liz
Yes, because, I totally agree with that. You got to give time for what you do to work. It's hard to be patient. I know. One thing that really stuck with me that I learned was or that I heard was if you do like, because sometimes it's like a challenge, right? And you do a challenge and it's crickets, but it's only like a one time thing, it's not really wait 90 days to see if it works. But they were like, do it at least three times before you give up on it. Because you learn each time you do it. And you might see by the second or third time where the first time is like kind of crickets, or there's only a couple of people by the third time. Once you've learned and you've actually gone through it, it really will take off and you just need to give it a couple more tries. So, yeah, I was just like, it's kind of in that same vein, but where it's not something that a set number of days is going to help. It where you just got to do it a few more times. So, yeah, I love that.

[00:16:25.130] - Liz
Okay, so any final tips for people that are struggling with trying to streamline to be more productive, more profitable? What do you want them to know?

[00:16:38.910] - Stacy
Yes, you know there's so much that you can do, but I want you to focus on where it is you are right now, where it is that you ultimately want to go. I always love to say and teach on having the big picture in mind. And there are so many elements to being able to reach to that big picture. Don't get overwhelmed by all the steps that you have to take. Just take them one step at a time. And it really does help knowing that other people have been there, other people have been able to accomplish that great feat that you're looking to accomplish, whether it's that goal of the amount that you want to reach in terms of revenue in your business, you know, the profitability piece or the reach the amount of people you want in your audience to help. Because some of us, we are doing it with the heart and that mindset that we just want to reach people, and we hope, right, that we have what we need monetarily to do all the things and to be the blessing that we've been called to be. And just recognizing if you help someone to get to where they need to go, then it's going to come full circle.

[00:17:57.760] - Stacy
And so, just focus. Even if you have one person in your audience that's now responding, that is one more person that you are able to impact, and I hope and I believe for eternity, transformative impact. Because you love what you do. You're walking in purpose, and you're helping others to do the same as you're inspiring and encouraging them to walk in purpose because they're inspired by you walking in purpose. So, I want you to really think about the focus on what it is that you ultimately want to accomplish. That big picture plan, and just go ahead and work towards it one day at a time, one step at a time. If you feel overwhelmed, get the help of someone else. You're already doing that. Taking in all this training here in the summit, you know, you may have coach, you may have someone that's there in your corner, a little angel cheering you on, whatever you need. Don't let it stop you from focusing on what it is that you've been created fearlessly to accomplish and do in this season. We believe in you. I believe in you.

[00:19:06.670] - Liz
I'm resisting to urge to clap right now because it would be really loud. I love that. Okay. I know you do have something you want to tell our attendees about. I'm going to let you tell us about it.

[00:19:21.330] - Stacy
So, you know a big part of being able to get your message out there fearlessly and of course, being able to blog and create content and have all these moving parts that are so beautifully taking you down to that path of that big picture plan is really being able to build your authority. And people don't recognize how important it is when people Google you and when they take the time to put in your name, what comes up, what are you doing, how are you making an impact and showing that you are who you say you are and what you're about. Right? And so, just being able to help you with the template, whether it's starting to build your authorities through a book, it could be a lead magnet or it can be something that you first use to sell as a product in your shop. And just being able to find ways to monetize and become profitable right off the bat, even if you're just getting started or you need an infusion, a little injection of cash. And so, we've provided that along with some other training and opportunities to help you boost your authority. And so, you'll get that authority booster. If you did upgrade, you get access to that, but you can also.

[00:20:39.210] - Liz
Otherwise, you can go check it out for, you know, I don't know, for a good deal. But yeah, if you do get the all access passed, you will get access to that for free. Again, Stacy, thank you so much. And guys, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I appreciate you coming back, Stacy. It was fantastic.

[00:20:58.990] - Stacy
Thank you for having me. Always such a delight.
