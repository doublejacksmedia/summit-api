Hi, Destini here. And welcome to the short training, where I'm going to walk you through how to recession-proof your business by adding digital products to your portfolio. Now, for those of you who may not know me, my name is Dr. Destini Copp, and I am a college marketing professor turned online entrepreneur. I have been creating digital courses way back in the dark ages ever since 2005. So, I have been there and done that.

[00:00:45.820] - Destini
I'm also the host of the Course Creators MBA podcast and an Amazon best selling author of "launch your online course business in 90 days or less". I am the host of the Scale Your Business Summit and CEO of Destinicopp.com, which is my personal brand. We also have another brand called Hobby School, where we launch virtual summits and a lot of different hobby type niches, which that is a very fun brand if you want to check it out. You can find me on most social media platforms at Destini Copp. And I would love for you to contact me.

[00:01:24.550] - Destini
You can hook up with me on LinkedIn or DM me on Instagram. I would love to know more about you and your business. Now, I want to tell you a story, which one, I think you can kind of relate to this, or most of you can probably relate to this. A few years ago, I was on vacation with my family in Watercolor, Florida.

[00:01:49.030] - Destini
And if you've ever been to the Gulf Coast of Florida, the ocean and the beach does look like this. And one day my family was leaving to go to the beach, and I could not go with them. At that point in time, I was a Facebook ads consultant. So, I helped people create and you know load their Facebook ads into their business manager and launch them and optimize them. And I had a client that day whose Facebook ads were not performing as well as he liked, and he was unhappy.

[00:02:25.160] - Destini
So I had to stay back and work on them. And after that vacation, I came back and I said, that will never happen to me again. And that's when I went all in into creating digital products and automated sales funnels, sometimes we call them evergreen sales funnels in my business. So, today I have a variety of different offers, you know, that I have, and you can see some of them here, but most of my income comes from these passive income digital products and also affiliate marketing revenue.

[00:03:04.140] - Destini
Now, here's what you're going to learn in this short training today. I'm going to walk you through five types of digital products that are absolutely perfect for business owners and how to choose the best one to start with, so you can get started easily and quickly. Now, we're going to jump right in. Now, here's the five types of digital products that I recommend for business owners to kind of build out that digital product portfolio, if you would. The first one is a mini course.

[00:03:37.660] - Destini
And this is what it sounds like, a very tiny offer. It can range anywhere from like $27 all the way up to $99. And it's going to give your customer a quick win. And then we have what I call a subject matter course. And this type of course goes into a little bit more detail than a mini course would.

[00:04:01.960] - Destini
And then you have that full blown signature course which is your A to Z type you know formula that you teach people. It might even have some other stuff bundled in with it, which we'll talk about in just a second. And then you have a membership. And I love memberships because you're getting that monthly recurring revenue and it gives you kind of that stable income, if you would, into your business. And then of course, you have these digital products like ebooks, templates, swipe files, planners.

[00:04:36.180] - Destini
I love all of them and they are very easily created in Canva. So, all of those are options for you. Now, remember when I mentioned just a second ago, I talked about your signature offer and I mentioned it might have some other type of support in it. So, here is when you're kind of thinking about your digital products, you also have to think about how you're going to design them and how you're going to support your students in them. Now, the majority of my digital products are what I call a self-study type course.

[00:05:14.020] - Destini
So, if the student is going through it and they have questions, there are places in my classroom. And right now, I'm using Kajabi where they can go in and ask questions and I'll answer them. You can also have some type of Facebook group or community. And I also have tested this out and use this in some of my other programs. I use Upcoach, there's other people out there using Circle, I think it's Circle.so, very successfully. So, there's a lot of different options for you there.

[00:05:47.560] - Destini
Now, when you are adding in this other type of support, like the communities or the live Zoom calls, which a lot of people do in membership, or even one on one support or group coaching, when you're adding in that additional support, you're going to want to price it accordingly. So, for instance, like your signature offer, which we talked about earlier, which is your A to Z type online course where you kind of you know walk people through your entire formula, you're most likely going to have some extra support in that, but it's going to be priced accordingly. So, the signature courses and I'll go back to the slide for just a second, the signature courses can be anywhere from 500 or 2000, 3000, I've even seen them going up to like 5000 when there's a lot of support in them. Okay. Now what I generally recommend, if you are just starting out and kind of dipping your toes into creating digital products, I would like for you to start with a mini course or maybe even a low priced digital product like a planner.

[00:07:03.490] - Destini
And the reason why, and there's a lot of reasons why I love minicourses, and one of the reasons why is that minicourses can be created in less than a week. And I'm going to walk you through some tips today on how to do this and let you know that it absolutely can be done. So, if you are really wanting to kind of dip your toes into this and get started quickly, you could have your mini course created very, very soon. So, let's talk a little bit more about minicourses. The reason why I love minicourses, and I think most online business owners need to have one in their back pocket, is that you can just use them in a lot of different ways in your business.

[00:07:52.090] - Destini
The first one is using it as a tripwire. So, when somebody signs up for your lead magnet, maybe you have a PDF type lead magnet or cheat sheet or something like that on your thank you page. You will have your sales page for your tripwire and it'll say something like, wait, before you go, I have this special offer that I think you may be interested in, so you can get an instant customer and get that revenue in your business from that mini course. The other reason why I love minicourse is that you can sell them fairly easily through email versus a signature course. You're going to need something in general a little bit more substantial to sell it, like maybe even doing a live webinar or a fiveday challenge or something like that.

[00:08:45.270] - Destini
You can also use a minicourse in collaboration opportunities. As an example, let's say that you have been invited to be a virtual summit speaker and the host of the summit is looking for a donation for the all access pass. You could put one of your digital products in that all access pass, the host will be happy, it'll give you an opportunity to get more eyeballs on your business and it's just a win-win for everybody. And it also can be used as a lead magnet for special events. So, there's a lot of different ways you could use something like this in your business.

[00:09:27.840] - Destini
Now let's talk about how to plan out your digital product portfolio so you can maximize your revenue, which will help you recession-proof your business. Now, the first thing I want you to do, if you're just getting started, you don't have your idea yet, I really want you to sit down, grab a piece of paper and start thinking about how you help people, maybe what are you blogging about, think about the type of questions you're getting today from your audience on social media, from clients, anybody who you're working with. Think about what knowledge you have, your superpower, and you're just going up. Lay it all down on a piece of paper and just start brainstorming about some things that you can teach on. Now when I first started doing this when I moved into entrepreneurship from my nine to five type job, I had a lot of different things that I could help people with.

[00:10:27.360] - Destini
I was really good with managing a remote organization. I had a thousand people in my remote organization when I left my nine to five, so I was really good at that. They were all remote, scattered across the US, so I Could have done something in that area. I was really good with my organization and productivity, so I could have done something there.

[00:10:52.540] - Destini
I eventually landed on helping people create online courses because I had been doing that since 2005. And I combined that with all of my marketing knowledge, so I help people create online courses and also, which is most important, probably part of the process, I help them market them. Now, after you have that you've done your brainstorming, I want you to go in and conduct some research on what's in the market. Of course, you can go to Google, but I also want you to go to like, marketplaces, like creative market, Etsy, AppSumo, if you're in the business kind of market and Udemy.

[00:11:34.480] - Destini
And I'm gonna talk about Udemy in just a second also. And just go in there, look to see what kind of digital products do they have. Now I know creative market and Etsy has a ton of digital products. I have purchased a lot of those digital products. And of course, like Masterclass, Skillshare, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy. They have a ton of online courses in a lot of different areas and just get an idea on what's in the market.

[00:12:04.930] - Destini
Now, this doesn't mean that you're going to copy what other people have done. But if somebody out there is already teaching what you want to teach about, that means that there's a demand in the market for it. It doesn't mean that you're going to copy them, you're certainly not going to do that. You're going to add your own kind of influence and superpower in there, but you want to make sure that there's a demand in the marketplace for that.

[00:12:35.130] - Destini
So, I mentioned just a second ago, I was going to tell you a little bit more about Udemy. So, if you go to Udemy and if you sign up to be an instructor, if you go to their market insights, you can conduct market research for free on your niche. So basically, you go there, you type in what you're interested in teaching about, they will let you know what kind of demand they're seeing for that, how many people are searching for that topic. This is a wealth of information.

[00:13:09.340] - Destini
Not only will they tell you how many people are searching, they will also tell you how many, basically, should kind of give you an idea of how many courses they have already in that particular niche. So, you'll kind of see how saturated the market is. And it's okay if there's other people out there teaching on it. Actually, you want that, but you also kind of see what the demand is also, okay? Now I want you to brainstorm ideas for your online course portfolio.

[00:13:42.310] - Destini
Now, I talked with you just a second ago, why I recommend that you go with a mini course. You can also create some digital type products also, but eventually, you will likely want to add other courses to it to, kind of build out your portfolio so you can increase your revenue. Now, here's something that I did for a client or student recently. This particular student was in the cryptocurrency niche. So, we went out and did research because they wanted to get an idea what kind of courses could they do, what should they start with and how could they build it out later.

[00:14:23.220] - Destini
So, as an example, we landed on doing like a lead magnet mini course. What is cryptocurrency? So, you're getting somebody who's very much a beginner, like me. I'm not an expert in this area, so very much a beginner, getting this started. A lot of people are going to have that question, what is cryptocurrency?

[00:14:44.620] - Destini
What exactly is it? They don't really know what it is. And then going into the tripwire mini course, "Cryptocurrency 101: a Complete Guide for Beginners". So, going in just a little bit more detail. And then upsell course, or this could even be a membership, how to get started in trading cryptocurrency.

[00:15:11.700] - Destini
Now you can you know change that up a little bit, especially if you want to do a membership, have an ongoing membership to help people with trading cryptocurrency. So, you kind of get the idea there. And then of course, an example of a cross sell course here. Buy, sell and create NTFs. So that gives you an idea of how you can go in and kind of brainstorm ideas for your online course portfolio.

[00:15:37.440] - Destini
Now here's another example. This example centers around somebody who helps people do home gardens and homesteading. So, a lead magnet for this particular person could possibly be a PDF guide on container gardening with a mini course. That's a tripwire on planning a raised bed garden with diagrams. So, go in, have some videos there, have some diagrams there.

[00:16:06.600] - Destini
It will give their students a very much a quick win. So, once you add them to your online course, you're going to start your nurture emails, and in there, you're going to promote your other products and services. So, you could have a cross sell course in there. Maybe you want to do some virtual gardening or homesteading consultation. So, you could definitely do that and promote that in there.

[00:16:32.320] - Destini
And then eventually you could promote like a coaching A to Z signature homesteading course or even a membership there. Membership would probably actually work very well in that situation. So, there's lots of opportunities there to add additional revenue into your business. Now, I want to let you know that it is easier to get started than you think. And I want to walk you through a couple of things here.

[00:16:59.610] - Destini
Now, this is an example of a mini course outline, and I'll show you in just a second. This is actually it. Or I have an outline for this in the Google Sheets that has all of our online course ideas. So, basically, what you're going to do, you're going to start with your promise transformation. So, basically, what that is telling you or what you're outlined there is what will your students accomplish after completing your course?

[00:17:29.810] - Destini
Creating a course for the marketplace is very different than creating a course for somebody who is completing like an educational program, like an MBA or a bachelor's degree. In there, you have all these learning objectives and then, you know it's just a different process. Here, you are strictly going to focus on at the end of this course, my student will be able to do XYZ. Okay? That is, everything in your course will center around that.

[00:18:07.890] - Destini
Now, for a mini course, you're not going to have a lot of different videos. You're not going to have a lot of different lessons. Quite frankly, I would even argue in a subject matter course or a signature course, you're not gonna, you're not going to throw a lot of content in there. A lot of people think the more content I can throw in there, that's what increases the value and the price of my course. And that is not the case.

[00:18:35.790] - Destini
Your students are paying you, so that they can get your promise transformation the fastest way possible. And they do not have time, let me say it again, they do not have time to sit down and watch 30, 40, 60 minutes lessons. In fact, they want, there's been research studies done on this and lessons, course lessons, actually, you know, and it's even gone down here recently. Their attention spans are only a couple of minutes, two, three, five minutes. I know some people, I even go up to maybe even ten minute lessons in some of my online courses, but I think even that is pushing it.

[00:19:25.660] - Destini
So, your students want short, straight and to the point information, and they want short lessons. They don't have time to sit through these long videos. So I would argue in a mini course, it should be very short, maybe five lessons, five videos. You're gonna have some supplemental material, maybe a workbook, a cheat sheet or a checklist. Also, I don't want you to forget about your bonus material.

[00:19:59.960] - Destini
Now, this is material that they don't necessarily need to accomplish your promise transformation, but it's just nice to have information. But most importantly, it's bonuses that you can put on your sales page to help sell your course. So, people will look at that bonus and say, oh my goodness, I really have to have that. So, don't forget about your bonuses. And that's actually a mistake that a lot of people make.

[00:20:31.290] - Destini
Now, the other thing I want to point out is the same steps that you use to create your mini course are going to be the same steps that you would go through to create a higher price course, like what we talked about earlier, like your subject matter course or your signature course. There are a few exceptions to this, but the process is very, very simple. And I think a lot of people try to make it a little bit more complicated than what it needs to be. The other thing I want to let you know, and this is one of my last tips here for you today, is that you can use Canva to create your lesson presentations and even record your lesson videos in Canva. In fact, I use Canva to create the presentation that you are watching today, and I'm currently recording it in Canva. So, it is super, super easy.

[00:21:36.110] - Destini
So, there you go. I hope I have inspired you to go in and create your first digital product. And then as you kind of dip your toes there, you can expand out into other types of digital products that you can add to your portfolio to help recession-proof your business. Now, like I said before you go, make sure you grab your free gift, I've included the link here.

[00:22:05.790] - Destini
Now, if you can't find the link, you can always go to my website and grab the free gift there. Now, if you go to your Google sheet and you can see the tab in there for the mini course outline, I just want to let you know that that is there. I hope you enjoyed this presentation. If you have any questions whatsoever, please contact me on social media. Mostly hang out on LinkedIn or Instagram, and you can find me both there.

[00:22:37.090] - Destini
Have a great rest of your day. Bye for now.
