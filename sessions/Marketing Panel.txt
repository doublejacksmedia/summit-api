I think it is 11:00. I'm going to go ahead and get started. Guys, welcome. Thank you so much for coming to the marketing panel. I'm super excited to have Stephanie and Ann Marie here. They are amazing. I'm going to tell you a little bit about them because if you don't know them, you should. Ann Marie O'Braskin is an office binging IPA drinking perpetually snacking child wrangler. I love that. Who loves helping busy entrepreneurs grow their businesses through marketing five minutes at a time. I can relate so hard to that today. You have no idea. And the wonderful Stephanie Blake is a business strategist and coach who helps service providers and coaches create businesses that allow them to work less than 20 hours a week and live life on their terms. She helps simplify, streamline and scale businesses to six plus figures while keeping them in the CEO seat and working less than 20 hours a week. Like we said, she helped over 500 plus women to start and scale their own business to reach their unique freedom goals. Yes, because first of all, and there's a pre submitted question that I will start with, but I just want to say marketing is the thing I struggle with most because I feel like it takes me forever.

[00:01:07.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And so I'm very excited to dive into this topic with you guys. The first pre submitted question we have is pretty specific, so hopefully we'll have some great answers. Any suggestions for Etsy products, physical and digital? I've tried Facebook Ada once but had no clue what I was doing. I've had little success with Pinterest pens. I'm currently at a loss at where to even start to focus in terms of marketing. So what advice do you have in that regard?

[00:01:34.590] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Yeah, the very first place you should start with that is on Etsy, your SEO and optimizing your listings. And all of your keywords is going to get you better long term success than anything off of the platform. You can drive traffic as much as you want, but because you are on a platform that you don't own and is full of other people's products, that realistically. There's going to be some similarities. It's rare that any of us are selling something that literally no one else does. So we need to be able to be found in the wide, vast world of Etsy. I thought it was very appropriate that you were reading my description as my five year old came up because we unexpectedly have a snow day today.

[00:02:38.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
My niece is unexpectedly very sick. The Facebook Live started late today because her mom was on her way home.

[00:02:44.780] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
But it was outside. Sure, that's fine.

[00:02:48.470] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
No more talking. But once you have the listings and all of your SEO set up and optimized there, then you can go out to those other platforms. I know they said that they didn't have much success with Pinterest pins, but I would go back and make sure that you're utilizing it in the best way. Make sure that they're set up as products, and maybe just test out some different stuff because one way might not work, but like, shifting it a little bit, maybe you'll see a little bit more success.

[00:03:24.270] - Steph Blake
Yeah, I wanted to wait until the Ann Marie was done, but I have a couple of pieces of a couple of suggestions too. I actually used to have an Etsy store. Now this was like, almost eight years ago. So things have definitely changed then. I guarantee it. But like Ann Marie said, definitely focusing on the platform. It's like when you're on Amazon, like, if you're searching for something on Amazon, you have to work inside of that platform. So you have to go with the SEO. It's the same thing if you're on Pinterest. Like, Pinterest is a search engine too, so you have to cater everything to that specific platform that you're on. Using the correct terms that people are searching for is another really big one. You have to get into the brain of the person who's buying this and think, okay, what is this person searching for? Somebody's not going to be let's say you're creating a planner for 2023. Somebody's not going to be searching, like, I don't even know. Somebody's going to search for, like, 2023 Planner. They're not going to be searching for like, gorgeous planner with flowers and lions. They don't know.

[00:04:28.310] - Steph Blake
You have to get into their brains and literally think, like, if you were going to Google to search for something, what would you type in that? And that's how you want to start to set up your descriptions and your title inside of Etsy. Do you remember that from what I was going to be?

[00:04:41.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Weekly planner or monthly planner? It's not going to be Red Line Planner or things like that.

[00:04:48.250] - Steph Blake
Exactly. You have to keep it as simple as possible because people, when they're searching for things, they're not thinking collective. They're just like, give me the answer to my solution that I need right now. Another thing that you can do is definitely use Pinterest. Don't stop using Pinterest, but make sure that the pins that you're using, you have big blocks of text and also images on there. Again, you want to make it easy for people to understand what you're selling, right? And then use the language, especially in the title of your Pin. So, like, 23 weekly planner. Click here to get it for $5, whatever it is. And then you can also submit your products to services like BuzzFeed. And I don't know if you guys have everything, like those roundups of like 50 best, whatever, 50 of my favorite. I don't know.

[00:05:38.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They have so many I get lost in them all the time.

[00:05:41.710] - Steph Blake
Right? Exactly.

[00:05:43.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you love organizing your socks, you're going to love these products too. They get real specific.

[00:05:49.180] - Steph Blake
Exactly. So you can actually submit your products into those now. Are they going to get accepted every single time. No, let's be honest here, but why not try? Because BuzzFeed is a huge platform that people are always looking on. I had one of my products in there and all of a sudden it just like, blew up. And I was like, where are all these people coming from? And then I saw the BuzzFeed article and I was like, I got like 200 sales in like a day. And I was like, what if those are just a couple of very specific pieces of advice?

[00:06:20.730] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I didn't know you could submit to BuzzFeed. I'm going to have to go look that up. Can you just Google submit product to BuzzFeed and it'll pop up with us? Okay.

[00:06:29.950] - Steph Blake
And you can also go one step further and you can actually pitch the editors of those specific sections. So that gets more into like, the PR route. But you have more of a shot if you actually submit it to a human than you would honestly submitting it for one of the feeds.

[00:06:49.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, that's all I look at those articles all the time and never cross my mind. Yeah, Amazon, of course they don't.

[00:07:01.990] - Steph Blake
Exactly. So if you go to the top and you'll see who creates them, it's usually only a couple of people who create all of the round ups.

[00:07:08.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, that's awesome. Okay. We have a question from the comments. What's a good resource for ecommerce SEO? I know this isn't like an SEO, but we're kind of touching on it.

[00:07:21.980] - Steph Blake
This is not my zone of genius. I'm going to be honest with you.

[00:07:27.950] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
I definitely send people, other places or outsource within my agency to someone else to do it. Who does like ecom SEO, but there are a lot of really good leaders in the industry that you can find and definitely look at people who are ecomm specific because SEO for other types of businesses can be totally different.

[00:07:58.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sasha Hutchinson, who does a session, I think on day, either tomorrow or Friday, maybe today. I don't know when her session airs. I know it hasn't aired is like a top 1% Etsy seller. So I would definitely go to her and look at her stuff and get kind of what she has to say on that because I know she would be a good resource for that. And then Alexis is asking about keyword research tools and I'm going to direct you to Nikki Robinson's session, which may have expired. I'm going to be extending access because there's a whole tech thing going on right now. So you guys will be able to watch that. But if you go to the notebook, the free Notebook, you should see all the links there. So I'm going to go risk your respective marketing because SEO is an important way to get traffic. Marketing is another channel, so they're similar, but they're not the same. So I find my biggest struggle with marketing, besides, in fact, I just don't want to write social things ever. I know I can ever green it, I know I can schedule it, but that takes so long.

[00:09:03.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do you guys have any tricks or tips to make marketing less annoying?

[00:09:09.150] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Definitely. I ran into this problem too, and I enjoy it. I enjoy making it. But once I had kids, I realized that there's a lot less time to sit down and write a bunch of content. So I found that breaking it down into smaller tasks makes it actually doable as well as when the idea comes to you. It's usually not going to be the time that you dedicate to writing. You're going to have ideas like when you're driving in the or at least I do when you're driving in the car, when you're in the shower or something like that. And so I find that if I have a running page on Notion where I just drop all of my ideas and if I feel like writing a post did I have a couple of minutes, then I'll write it all in there. And so then when I come back and I'm like, okay, I have my five minutes to do this post, I can go back in there, grab the idea that's already there so I'm not starting from scratch every single time. And on the same lines, like using templates, templates makes it so much easier.

[00:10:33.210] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
And I don't mean like necessarily like copying and pasting a full template, but like if you have a template that gives you an outline that makes it move a lot faster, please hold on. And it just kind of moves things along more quickly so you're not using all of that extra brain power to wasting it thinking of the technical aspects of things.

[00:11:04.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Okay, I like that. Stephanie, do you have yeah, I have.

[00:11:10.660] - Steph Blake
Lots of thoughts on this SEO. I'm the same way I use click up and I have a doc and click up where I just keep all of my ideas. Like, for example, I have a seven week old, so I have to feed him in the middle of the night right now. So in the middle of the night when I was feeding him, I had like four different ideas for reals come to me out of the blue and I just wrote them down. And it took me ten minutes to write down four post ideas. So having a running doc always amazing, so helpful, and then you can come back to it and create when you're ready to another big thing batching content. I'm sure you guys have heard about this, but creating all of your content in one short amount of time is going to be a life saver, especially if you don't have a lot of time to work. I personally create all of my content for the month in 2 hours because I have all of my ideas and a doc, I come back to them. I pull whichever ones I want and then I create the content for it.

[00:12:09.500] - Steph Blake
Or I will create for example, I do a lot of video just because I like talking. If you can't tell, I'll repurpose that one large video. So say, for example, I'm doing a podcast interview with somebody and they allow me to use their video. Or I do like a live training. I'm going to cut that up into like 15 or 20 different pieces of content, and I'm going to post all those pieces of content. So from one interview, one training that I did, I have 15 to 30 pieces of content. There's a month worth of content from that alone. And then you can also repurpose past content that's worked well. So, for example, if you go to your analytics and Instagram SEO, you use Instagram and you notice that one posted really well and you posted it three months ago, post it again. Maybe you change like, the headline or maybe you change the graphic, but you can use that same content again. Nobody's saying you can't use it. It's not like a one and done thing. You want to continue using what works and then get rid of what doesn't work. Or maybe you could test things out.

[00:13:08.990] - Steph Blake
Like you could repurpose a piece of content that you put six months ago that you thought was really great, but maybe you just posted it at the wrong time of day so you can post it again at the opposite time of day and see if it works then. So why don't you create something one time? Don't ever think that you can't use it again. That's my biggest hack for content creation, especially when I get overwhelmed.

[00:13:30.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, we've had a couple of questions come in. Someone asks, do all the tips and tricks we're learning this week transfer to online ESL, teachers and tutors. Just getting started. And I think, yeah, I mean, you're going to adjust things based on your goals, but I think absolutely anyone that's working it really applies to online space. I know I say bloggers, but that's just every year I get like, you know, this applies to other people. And I was like, yes, I do. And then another question, can I say.

[00:14:01.630] - Steph Blake
One thing to that? Yeah. SEO when you're creating content, the biggest.

[00:14:05.880] - Steph Blake
Thing that you need to know is.

[00:14:06.770] - Steph Blake
Who you're talking to. So it doesn't matter what industry you're in. So say you're a tutor. Who are you speaking to in your content? Likely the parents of those kids. Those are the people who are going to be hiring you. So that's the content that you need to be creating. That's the person that you need to be speaking to. So it can work for literally anything. It's not like specific. It's all about talking to the right person and using the words that connect with them on a really deep level. That's just like surface level.

[00:14:36.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sorry.

[00:14:36.860] - Steph Blake
Go ahead.

[00:14:37.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's great. And then we have another question, but I'm going to kind of rephrase it a little bit because of course you can get traffic with SEO, but it takes time. And when you're starting from zero so you just started a blog, you've written some SEO. Often it's post, you're waiting for those to kind of do their magic. How would you start from zero with marketing?

[00:15:00.770] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
That's a really good question. Getting that base content into play. So you have your blog, I assume you're having traffic or you have blog posts set up, but then getting a base on the social platforms as well, so that if somebody comes to your profile, they have some things to go through. So like on Instagram, set up like six or nine posts in there so that they can have different things to look at that speak directly to that target reader. Because you want it to be super clear when someone finds you online, if you are right for them or if you're not. And so it's okay if it's a little bit polarizing too, because it just will bring in those people. And then if you want to move more quickly, ads. You can use ads to drive traffic. You can use ads to promote your social content and then just the amount of content you produce as well. So the more you push out, the more people it's going to get in front of. But that's not necessarily doable all the time. So either quantity of content or ads, I would say are the two fastest way to grow.

[00:16:35.390] - Steph Blake
I completely agree with what she said. And I would also suggest, yes, I'm going to say repurposing. You can repurpose that blog post that you wrote into multiple social media posts as well. So like innery was saying, you need to have that foundation. So when somebody searches for you on Instagram, they're seeing your content. Take that really long blog post that you made, chop it up into nine different images. Boom. You have your foundation created. Do that with every single blog post that you're writing. Your content is literally writing itself for you, right? That's the easiest way to get started. You've already written the content. Don't try to overthink it and make it harder than it needs to be by thinking you have to create new content for a different platform. You may need to word it differently. Like your call to action would need to be different for Instagram because they can't click on a link in a caption, so maybe it says, click the link in my bio or send me a DM to learn more. Something like that. So that would be my biggest suggestion, to repurpose everything. Make your life easy.

[00:17:35.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and I think especially because I'm awful at social media. So, yes, it is possible to have a successful blog without doing really social media. If you guys see me on social media, it's almost all automated because I'm terrible. I try to go live on this. I don't know what I'm doing on Instagram at all, just so you guys know. But if you're repurposing, that makes it easy, and that's what it is. I use a tool that repurposes my blog post to social posts. So that just heads up there. But I wanted to add to what Ann Marie was saying with your base content is I SEO. I'm on Instagram a lot. I don't actually create for Instagram a lot, but I'm on there a lot. And I don't know if you guys see those reels where it's like, welcome to the part of Instagram where we and they're like, we don't do this, and we don't care if it's this and the house is messy. That's a great example of kind of helping someone figure out if you're right for them or not. So just wanted to add that out there because it popped into my head.

[00:18:35.350] - Steph Blake
It's okay to repel people. You should be repelling people.

[00:18:38.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and you can repel people without being a jerk, of course. But that was a question yesterday of like, I don't want to be controversial. And it's like you can have an opinion without being disrespectful to others opinions. You can be like, Good for you. We're not the right fit. That's okay. Just as a heads up, and I know we're talking about Instagram, but there's a lot of different marketing platforms out there. So instagram may be kind of what's hot and what a lot of people are doing, but how do you decide the right marketing platform for you? How do you figure out if it doesn't come naturally to you? Like, tips in that regard, I think would be helpful. And then we have some more questions coming through that we can talk about after.

[00:19:24.180] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
The first thing that I would think about is what kind of content do you enjoy creating? Swhato is easiest for you to create? So if you are like Stephanie and you like doing video, then you could think about which platform prioritizes video. So it's like, okay, if you're good with short form video, maybe TikTok is for you or Instagram reels. But if you're like the idea of doing videos is terrible, then you wouldn't want to try TikTok because that is going to be exhausting for you if you don't like it. And then also look at where your audience is. So you want to just make that decision on a combination of what type of content you enjoy creating and where is your audience, because you can see the demographic information and all of that for each platform. You can google it. There's like, studies out there that show, okay, where is each type of person? And then you can dive in deeper based on what your audience likes, what type of content is out there, too.

[00:20:45.870] - Steph Blake
Yeah, I was going to say go where your people are. Take the path, at least for this. Because if you're trying to, let's say your core demographic is, I don't know, men in their early twenty s, I don't know where this group hangs out, but I'm guessing it's not on Instagram. I'm guessing they're probably on TikTok, right? So along the way,

[00:21:13.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
they're likely not on Pinterest.

[00:21:14.940] - Steph Blake
Exactly. That's a search engine. So that's like a whole other topic of conversation. Exactly. So we're probably not going to be creating Pins for that group of people. So I have something controversial that I'm going to say. So here's an example of repelling and pulling these people. So it's very important to create content that feels good to you. But for example, if you know that your person is only on a video platform, you may have to suck it up and do video. Like if you know they're on YouTube, you're going to have to get comfortable creating YouTube videos. You're going to have to get comfortable creating TikTok videos. Right, I know it's terrifying at first because it's like something brand new. You're afraid of what people are going to say about you.

[00:22:01.060] - Steph Blake
The whole list of fears goes on and on. But if that's literally the only place where your person is at, you have to do it. There's no other way around it. Or you don't really have business because you won't have customers. There may be the outlier on other platforms, but again, we're all about working smarter, not harder. We don't want to force it onto people, and especially on the platforms that they're not even on. Right. So I never tell people, but I'm okay with that.

[00:22:27.600] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
I'm going to go off of that a little bit. That I totally agree that, yes, sometimes you do just kind of have to suck it up and do it even if you don't like it. But I would say that there are ways around it. If it's like you really don't want to put your face out there, there are other ways to create videos too. So it might be something where you need to get a little bit creative or just outsource it. If you have the capabilities of doing that, maybe that's the way that you handle that outlet.

[00:23:05.850] - Steph Blake
Yes, I completely agree with that. For example, you can show your screen on your phone in a Reel, or you can show your computer screen and do a tutorial on your computer and turn that into a YouTube video.

[00:23:16.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely.

[00:23:18.030] - Steph Blake
And to make yourself a little bit to practice a little bit, you could use something like Loom. Or your face is just a little tiny circle in the corner so you're still there, they're still seeing you, but you're really small. It's not your full face on the screen yet. Right. And then over time, of course you're going to become more comfortable because it just takes practice. Yes, that went off on a tangent.

[00:23:40.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I absolutely agree with that. If you guys really hate putting your face on video. There's little cartoon programs you can do. There's like, whiteboard Draw out there, like, create video without my face or something. Or like, I think POW Toon is one I've heard of. That's really good. There's so many. Like canva. You can do all sorts of stuff. Like, you can do presentation on Canva and then record it and then share it. There's lots of different ways that you can do video that doesn't necessarily involve your face. Personally, I am really not great at editing videos, so I'm like, yeah, talking head perfect for me. Doesn't require a lot of effort. I just have to show up and turn it on. So it just kind of depends. All right, question we have is, does a blog have to be complete or can we have a continued next time sort of thing? Correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like that's great for social media, but maybe not so good for, like, a blog post, like having a part one, part two on social media, like open loop idea.

[00:24:44.730] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
You can certainly have next in the series. I would make sure that whatever you're putting out there is like a complete thought on its own, but then it can if it leads into another thing, like another post, that's great. Something that keeps them coming back or keeps them on your profile. That can totally work well, but I just wouldn't leave it all the time where people are coming and they're like, oh, I didn't really get anything from this. It was just kind of teasing and trying to get me to come to the next thing.

[00:25:21.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah, no, I've experienced those and I'm like, oh, I didn't get what you promised. It's completing the thought of what you promised they would in whatever piece of content.

[00:25:33.520] - Steph Blake
Right? Yeah, I agree. And I had an example pop into my brain when Ann Marie was talking was say, for example, you're writing a long blog post about Ada, how to use ads in your business. And maybe part one is Facebook Ads, and you complete your entire thought process about Facebook ads. And then part two is Google Ads. Part three is Pinterest ads. But you always want to make sure on those main blog posts, you're linking to those other blogs after you write them. Part one, you're linking at the bottom to check out part two about Google Ads. Check out part three about pinterest ads. So you're getting those back links in there as well. And you could do the same thing on Instagram, too. Now, for Instagram, I would probably do like a carousel or something like that so people can swipe through and you could say, stay tuned for part two coming on Tuesday. I don't know, whatever that you're doing.

[00:26:25.690] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that because I feel like I said, I'm such a lurker on social media, but I watched them like, oh, I was like, wait, what did the final thing turn out to be? Like, what did that look like that caught you through or whatever, where it's like, oh, you showed me and you put it in the kiln and now what? What's it look like?

[00:26:50.210] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
This is a really great way to drive traffic back to your blog, too, because you can say, like, oh, you start the conversation and you include one or two things, and you say, like, hey, I have a list of twelve reasons, or My twelve favorite whatever. And you say, like, hey, read the rest of it on the blog.

[00:27:13.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, like, where you're easily providing the like, here's the thing that you're looking for the rest of it. I think that's great. I think that's perfect. The problem is when you're like, and part two is coming, but I'm not going to tell you where it is, and I'm not going to go back and fix part one so that you then find it. I'm like, well, where to go?

[00:27:31.150] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
I wouldn't post it in real time. Yeah, I would like, have the whole thing done and then you can do like yeah, exactly.

[00:27:40.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So, we got a comment. So, like, three tips and the first blog is the first tip. Sure. So blog post is usually I think it depends on what you're considering to be a blog post versus a blog post is very different from a social media post. You should not post an entire blog post into a social media caption.

[00:27:58.070] - Steph Blake
You can't. There's not enough room.

[00:27:59.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, like blog posts are usually fairly long, like at a bare minimum, like, what, 300- 500 words and really ideally a thousand.

[00:28:09.370] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Right.

[00:28:11.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I just want to make sure we're being clear because you're using the term blog, and I want to make sure we're being clear as a blog post versus social media post. Okay, let's see, what other questions come in. What tool do I automatically use to repurpose? So it's called Missing letter. I can post a link to that because I'm so inactive on social. It posts up for me, but it's not that I get like I don't get a ton of engagement. So I've actually been doing less of kind of putting my blog post through that just because the return, even though it only takes five minutes, that adds up when you have four sites. So I've actually kind of stopped doing that right now. But if you really just want to be able to have something going out because they'll do like a year long campaign in five minutes, so I will post a link to that. Okay, so I think we've answered all the questions so far based on our conversation. What are some things you want to make sure people know about marketing and tips? I'm going to let you guys kind of refer it while we wait for more questions.

[00:29:15.330] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Yeah, I think that for everything that's out there and everything all of. The education and the courses and all of that. There's no shortcut to do this. There are ways to make things easier. There are things that you can automate, there are things that you can do to speed up the process. But you still need to go do the work and have your core marketing elements in place. Because if you're not doing that, something is going to be missing, and your audience will be able to tell that whether they know they're noticing this particular thing or not. But if you aren't clear on who you're speaking to, they're not going to be clear on who you're speaking to.

[00:30:11.650] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
That type of thing. And like, if you're not super clear on what your goals are and what you're trying to deliver, they're not going to be clear on that either, because your message is going to be a little muddled. And so you want to have those core things in place and not think that one strategy or one course or whatever it is, is going to suddenly skyrocket you to fame without very much work.

[00:30:44.810] - Steph Blake
Yes, I totally agree. I was writing down thoughts while you were talking because I have ADHD in case anybody else here does perfect so I'm always getting a million ideas in my brain. So if you see me, like, writing things, so I don't like Ann Marie said, yes, you have to give it time. I always say give it a minimum of 90 days, 90 days of consistent effort to see results. And then you need to make sure that you're also keeping track of what you're doing. Like, you need to make sure you're keeping track of, like, what's performing well, what's not performing. And that could be as simple as once a week or even once a month, if you don't have a ton of time, log into your platforms, see what posts are working, see what blog posts are working well, and then do more of what's working and do less of what's not working. Very simple. And then what else did I put? Knowing who you're talking to, this is the most important part of all. Because if you don't know who you're talking to, if you don't know the deep desires that they have, you're literally posting content for the sake of it.

[00:31:48.390] - Steph Blake
And you're frankly wasting a lot of time because your content is not connecting with that person. And they will almost never buy from you if it's not connecting with them. Especially for women, as women, I don't know how many women are on here, but we buy from an emotional place. So you have to connect to women from an emotional place, not necessarily a logical place. So it's also good to have a mix of that content when you're marketing as well. Logical and emotional. I'm not saying to manipulate people. Don't ever do that. We're not manipulating people. We are just showing them how we can help them through an emotional way of using our words, if that makes sense. But my other suggestion would be to not post content for the sake of it either. So don't just throw up like a Happy Monday post. Because nobody cares about your Happy Monday post. If you're throwing up a post that says, I'm so glad it's Monday, monday is my favorite day of the week because I get to connect with my clients, I get to change their lives. I get to do all of these things.

[00:32:51.750] - Steph Blake
XYZ that's so different than just throwing up, like, an Instagram post that says, Happy Monday because you feel like you have to throw up content, you're just wasting your time, to be totally honest. Only post content that's high quality. That's another piece of advice. So like I said before, by repurposing those blog posts, you're going to get high quality content because you're putting the time into creating those blog posts, right? So you're taking the time to create high quality content. You can repurpose that content into the other platforms as well. I think those are all things that I wrote down, period.

[00:33:25.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We've got some questions based on what you guys said.

[00:33:27.830] - Steph Blake
Okay, good.

[00:33:29.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
SEO. Karen asked, what do you consider your core marketing elements? I think that goes back to something Ann Marie said. It's making sure you have your core marketing elements in place. What are those?

[00:33:40.550] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Yeah, great question. Knowing who you're speaking to, that's definitely one, like, understanding that ideal customer and then having it super clear to yourself what you're speaking about. So, like, some people call them content buckets. Sometimes people call them content themes. But having three to five different things that you talk about consistently, that come back directly to those people that show itself, those people that you are speaking to, like your ideal client, and then you can do that. And when you have those things super clear for yourself, it makes creating the content easier too, because it's like you're speaking to an individual person. And the way that you're speaking to an individual person is different than how you may speak to a crowd. But if you have those two things in place, that's super helpful. And then also, I would say the third thing would be understanding your goals. Understanding your goals for the platform and for your business overall. So, what are you trying to get people to do from this content? Are you growing your community? Are you connecting with them? Or is this somewhere that you are posting content to make sales? Like, at the end of the day, what are you trying to do?

[00:35:10.210] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
So having those three things in place, I'm sure Stephanie is going to have some other ideas of things that you need to have in place as well, but definitely want those three things.

[00:35:21.270] - Steph Blake
Yeah. So some of mine are overlapping. Shocking, I know, but definitely goals. You need to know what your long.

[00:35:27.910] - Steph Blake
Term goals are for your business and.

[00:35:29.940] - Steph Blake
The specific platforms and also your short term goals. So we can just think long term for the sake of this conversation is, like, 90 days. So we always say you need to have a 90 day marketing strategy. And of course, we can tweak this based on what happens in your life, what happens in the world, but you need to have some kind of plan in place. So, like I said before, you can go back and you can track the data, figure out what's working, what's not working, also knowing who you're talking to. We've been saying this over and over again because it's so incredibly important. You need to understand who you're talking to and who you're not talking to as well. And you should always be speaking to that one main person, like Ann Marie said, and you also need to know the transformation that you provide to your ideal client, too. So this is something that a lot of people don't think about. They're just thinking about the struggles that somebody has. But you need to know how you, as the amazing person that you are, provide the transformation for the person that you want to work with, for the person that you want to sell to.

[00:36:23.720] - Steph Blake
So if you are selling printables on etsy, why are you the best person at creating printables on etsy? What makes your printable so much better than every other printable out there? If you need to understand why you're so great at this, what makes you different? What makes you stand out? Because once you understand all of these, I always say clarity creates confidence. So when you are clear on who you're talking to, the transformation that you're solving and what you're selling, you become so much more confident and showing up and speaking and marketing your business, because those are really the core things that you need. And then it just comes so easy. Like I said, in the middle of the night when I was feeding my son, I came up with four new ideas for Reels to create, because I know my audience on such a deep level, and I know how to speak to them, and I know exactly what they want. And I also know what I'm really great at, too, so I know how I can provide that transformation for them. And again, it's not going to happen right away. I've been doing this for seven years.

[00:37:18.010] - Steph Blake
It does take some time. It takes time to get really comfortable with it. But you have to start, right? You have to start somewhere. So starting with those main elements that Ann Marie said is so crucial to just doing something, to getting your name out there, right?

[00:37:37.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. No, I like that, and I hope you all managed to catch my cat trying to be feisty with me. Okay, so I like that you mentioned Stephanie a couple of times about having, like, a 90 day plan and being consistent and I think and I forget which previous speaker said this, but consistent doesn't necessarily mean constant. And so how do you figure out what consistent means to you and what's going to work for your audience? I don't know if you have any advice on that. Yeah.

[00:38:07.200] - Steph Blake
So this goes back to your goals. What are your goals? Like, how quickly do you want to grow your business? Is your goal to reach six figures in a year? Are you okay with making like your 1st $500? What is your goal? Because that will determine what consistency looks like for you. Okay. So if you want to make a lot of money really quickly, you're going to have to create more content. People are going to have to see you more often. They're going to need to trust you more quickly. Whereas if you're like, well, I want to make six figures in five years. Sure. Then you can post like one piece of, of content a week. It's just going to take longer. Right? And I'm talking purely about organic right now. I'm not talking about running ads. Ads are a whole other ball game that I don't think we're going to get into because that's advertising networking. But first and foremost, you need to understand what your goals are and then that will help you align your marketing strategy. And then from there, you can look at, say, for example, you have an online business and you want to launch something new.

[00:39:11.150] - Steph Blake
So say you want to launch a new product in your Etsy shop, or say you want to launch a course, or say you want to launch an ebook. The content that you create for that launch period is going to be completely different and the consistency of that content is going to be totally different from just like your normal day to day content. So you have to know what your goals are. You have to have some kind of strategy in place for each of the different seasons that your business is in. Okay, I don't want to overwhelm everybody too much, but I think that's a good place to stop right now.

[00:39:42.730] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Yeah.

[00:39:43.260] - Steph Blake
Unless there's any comments about it.

[00:39:44.810] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
From there, you can also listening to your audience, what are they indicating that they're enjoying? Do they like a lot of content? Do they not like a lot of content? Are they trying to engage with everything that you post? You can kind of get a sense of, hey, like if you try posting two times in one day, like, does your second post get crickets? And your first post does really well. You know, maybe they don't want more than one post in a day, that type of thing. And then you can and then literally listen to them, like read what they're writing. Because sometimes they will tell you if they like things, if they like the type of content that you're posting, if they like the videos versus an image or a graphic or something like that and that can help determine what you need to do in order to speak to your specific audience.

[00:40:44.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I like that. Okay, we do have another question which it's a shame, Liz Wilcox isn't here, but I will pass this along to her to answer as well. But I'd love to hear guys'feedback. So how do you feel about email marketing? Is there any suggestion on how to start building your list and what email support to use? Personally, that's like the only marketing I'm actually consistent with. But I'd love to hear your guys'thoughts in terms of using email marketing in your marketing system.

[00:41:12.150] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Yeah, I love email marketing. I think it's a great way, not only because you own your list, you have this list of people, you can move between platforms with the list if you want to. I think that different platforms are better depending on your goals and depending on the size of your list and what you're trying to do with it. For a lot of people who have really intricate automations and they tag people a lot and they do all this different stuff. Like active Campaign can be great because it has a ton of options and different platforms also can be good at different times like different phases of your business and depending on what you're selling and what you need to connect to. So active campaign is great. ConvertKit is great. And yeah, I use ConvertKit right now.

[00:42:18.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm wearing my ConvertKit shirt.

[00:42:20.100] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Oh nice. And then you can get started with something free too. Like if you're just getting started and you're like, you know what, I need to see if this is going to work for me. You can start with something free like MailChimp or something like that just to get started.

[00:42:36.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
ConvertKit has a free plan now.

[00:42:38.100] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Oh, and ConvertKit so.

[00:42:41.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The reason I say that, yes, I'm a big fan of ConvertKit. I've used them for years, I've tried other stuff. I always end up back at ConvertKit. I'm like, well I'll try to save some money, right? But no, but changing email service providers is a huge pain. So I kind of always like do your research and try to start with what you think you'll stick with. So be that Active Campaign, be that ConvertKit or MailerLite or whatever, but I do your research because it's a big pain and that's not like yes, it can be expensive sometimes, but if you're doing email marketing right, it should be paying for itself.

[00:43:12.990] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Definitely, yeah. And switching between platforms can also affect your deliverability and you won't get to as many people and that type of thing too, so it's helpful to stick with it. And then my favorite part of email marketing is also like automation. There's ways to automate different sequences based on if they're downloading something on your site, if it's a lead magnet or just like some sort of freebie or whatever. You want to call it. You can grow your list that way and then put them into a nurture, like, welcome sequence, introduce yourself, and then for your blog, it's a really easy way to direct people back to your site and back to different content that you've specifically curated based on what they downloaded. And you're giving them things that you know because you've done this work and you know exactly who you're speaking to, you can give them exactly what they want and what they can use. And so email marketing is a fantastic.

[00:44:18.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Way to do that.

[00:44:21.330] - Steph Blake
Yeah, I'm obsessed with email marketing. I am a huge tech nerd. Preface this. Before I started my coaching business, I was a virtual assistant and I did all techy stuff. So if you go into my Active Campaign account, your head will explode from all of the different complex funnels that I have set up. So I'm going to tell you right now, don't do that in the beginning because it will take you a lot of time to figure out you need to set up complex funnels as your business grows. So if you get really excited by seeing like, somebody has this really complex funnel, I want to set that up in my business. You likely don't need it right now at the stage of business that you're in. So going back to what they were saying, you have to know what your goals are for the platform before you use it, because switching is such a pain. I've been on like six different email platforms at this point, and my deliverability has gone down. Like Ann Marie said, I've lost half of my list one time because it didn't transfer. It was a whole big mess. So I personally chose Active Campaign because I had really big goals for my business.

[00:45:21.340] - Steph Blake
And I know that's a platform that I can grow on, and it has the different automations and things that I like. You can also get one of my favorite email providers to use. Getting started is Flodesk. It makes it so simple to get started with email marketing. If you don't have any big plans in the near future, in the next couple of years, the emails are really pretty. The interface is really easy to use. You can just drag and drop things in there. But in terms of creating a freebie, because I know this is something that a lot of people talk about, I have controversial feelings on this, so I don't think that you should create a freebie right away when you're getting started in your business, because you don't know what that freebie is going to be about. You need to understand your person. You need to understand what they want and what they need. And then you can take that information and you can put it into a freebie. But I only believe that you can understand what that information is. After you start to work with people, you can create a freebie right now.

[00:46:18.970] - Steph Blake
You can go into Canva and you can create a workbook and throw it up. And nobody's going to download it if you're not speaking to them, if you're not giving them exactly what they need. So in order to save your sanity and your time, frankly, I always suggest waiting. Now what you can do in the meantime is to just have a little box on your blog like enter your name and email and we'll send you a new blog post every week when they're posted like whatever it is. But you don't have to go out of your way to create this insane freebie that nobody will even likely download in the first place. And then again, you can repurpose those blog posts whenever that blog post comes out, send it to your email list, direct them to the blog post, and then from there, you can even put a link to your social media post. If you have an accompanying social media post, you can gain more followers on your social media account as well. So there's so many different ways that you can use email marketing, but again, it all comes back to your goals.

[00:47:12.370] - Steph Blake
And I feel like the majority of people here are in the beginning stages ish. So yeah, don't try to overcomplicate it. Just make it as simple as possible. Use a simple tool right now. Like ConvertKit is pretty simple to use. Or like I said, flow desk is also simple. I personally don't want MailChimp. I've had a lot of issues with MailChimp.

[00:47:30.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I don't like MailChimp either.

[00:47:32.160] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
No, it's just like my go to like, hey, this is free.

[00:47:37.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And so many people have heard of it and integrates with everything, but generally speaking, I don't like it. I wanted to follow up on a couple of things you guys said. So obviously with welcome sequences and stuff, it's great to direct them to content, but it's also great when you have an email list to get eyes on brand new content. It's really fun when you send an email out to a certain post and then you go to Google Analytics and the real time just like jumps up because everyone's open your email. So that's just fun. So, it's a great way to get eyes on new content. And then the other part of that question was how do you grow your list? And yeah, you can do freebie, but really you need to just ask. Ask them call to action over and over again, hey, have you signed up to my email list? Hey, have you joined the email list? So you've at the newest updates or discount codes or freebies or whatever. You will get sick and tired of saying it. You may have said it 17 times, but that one audience member may have only seen you say it twice over and over and over again.

[00:48:35.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Ask them to join the email list. Like make it impossible for them to not know you have one.

[00:48:45.590] - Steph Blake
I think there's a stat. So a couple of years ago, it was you had to engage with somebody had to hear something from you eight times before they took an action. Now I think it's up to like 25 or 30.

[00:48:56.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:48:57.210] - Steph Blake
So if you're only talking about something 17 times, you have at least 17 more times to go for somebody who's going to take an action. So even if you're talking if you think you're talking about it too much, you're not talking about it enough. So keep talking about it. And if somebody is annoyed with you, they'll unfollow you. They'll unsubscribe. It's not the end of the world.

[00:49:14.660] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Totally fine.

[00:49:15.590] - Steph Blake
There's more people out there.

[00:49:18.930] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
No one is seeing your content as much as you are. SEO, like, you are the one who's seeing it more than anyone else. No one else is seeing it that much.

[00:49:27.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. You may have sent five emails about I sent five emails on the summit, but how many? Did they open every single email? Or you got to think about how do you interact with websites. You follow a brand. Do you open every single email? In which case you're not going to be tired because you love their stuff.

[00:49:45.150] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Exactly. If it's something worth it's like, oh, that's because I'm really into this person or this topic.

[00:49:53.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Exactly. So, they're not going to get sick of you, and if they're not quite the right person, that's okay. Or there's ways you can set it up so that they can be like, okay, I only want to be emailed once a week, or something. Like you can do get advanced if you get to that point. But generally speaking, you probably keep talking more than you think you need to.

[00:50:15.730] - Steph Blake
Yeah, exactly.

[00:50:17.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. All right, I haven't seen any other questions come in. Let's go ahead and wrap this up. Any final tips, thoughts, things you want to share?

[00:50:28.970] - Ann Marie O'Braskin
Don't make it harder on yourself than you need to. Make it as easy as you can. There's no prize for doing it the hard way.

[00:50:41.930] - Steph Blake
Yeah, I completely agree with that. Just keep it as simple as possible. Don't overcomplicate it. Don't overthink it. The content that you're creating right now, it can be repurposed. I'm going to keep saying this because I probably have at least 20 more times to go before it sticks. Going back to what we were saying before, but yeah, just keep it as simple as possible. Know who you're talking to. Keep it simple and know who you're talking to. And that's really the dream combination when it comes to marketing.

[00:51:07.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Awesome. Thank you, Stephanie Ann Marie. Thank you so much. Raula. I think I'm saying your name wrong. I'm very sorry, but yes. This will be available to watch for 24 hours. You guys will be getting an email to make sure there's been a little glitchiness in terms of stuff expiring when it shouldn't. And whatnot you guys will get 24 hours. I will make it right.
