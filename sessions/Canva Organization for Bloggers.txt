Hi, everyone. I am delighted to be participating in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. And in this training, I'm going to be providing some guidance for you to become better organized when working in Canva. It is my favorite Canva related topic, and I hope that by the end of this training that you're feeling a little more excited about organizing your designs and images in your Canva account. You're likely watching this training because you are struggling to some degree with the level of organization in your own Canva account, or you might feel reasonably organized, but you're always looking for ways to tidy things up a bit more. The reality is that if you don't create some organizational structure using folders inside of Canva that you can easily maintain, what will very quickly happen is that you're going to start creating designs. And while at first it will feel manageable to simply scroll until you find the design you're looking for, you will inevitably reach a point where you have so many designs that scrolling and searching becomes too cumbersome. You won't be able to quickly find what you're looking for. You're going to feel a lot more overwhelmed and you're going to waste a lot of your time.

[00:01:18.140] - Brenda
Now, if you're new to Canva, it is the perfect time to set up your system before you get to the point of feeling overwhelmed by all of your designs and images. And if you're already a veteran user of Canva, you may be feeling like it's already out of control. But I promise that you can still create a system and get things back on track. It is never too late. My goal for this training is to try to meet you where you're at in your experience using Canva's organizational features. Some of what I talk about in this video you may already be comfortable with. While for others, it will be brand new. But hopefully, you'll walk away with at least one more tip or idea that you can implement in your Canva account in order to get more organized. So here's what we're going to cover in this training: what Canva projects are, why you should be using projects to access your designs instead of your Canva home screen, and how to navigate the projects area in Canva. Then I want to cover a couple of organizational basics, including how to create custom folders and subfolders, and why you should not be relying on your uploads folder for your images.

[00:02:21.670] - Brenda
We'll look at the process of how to batch-organize in Canva for better efficiency. And then, I'll take you through a basic framework for tackling your Canva account if it's already a hot mess, so that you can create your own organizational system. Let's start with a super quick introduction. My name is Brenda Cadman, and I live in Charlottetown on beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada. I have been an entrepreneur for more than 23 years, with the majority of that time being spent running a website development company. And it was in late 2022 that I retired that website development business in order to focus all of my time on my role as a Canva and digital storage organization expert. And in addition to being a Canva-verified expert, I'm also a former professional organizer who specialized in organizing paper and filing systems. So, Canva organization is my sweet spot. Before we get started looking at the how-tos of getting organized in Canva, it's important to address that I'm making an assumption that you want to get more organized, and that you already see the benefits. But for those among you who might be on the fence and who might be wondering why you should care about getting organized, let's first take a quick look at some of the reasons that putting the time and effort into creating an organizational system in Canva or hiring someone to do it for you, why it's worthwhile.

[00:03:40.450] - Brenda
What are the benefits of getting organized in Canva? Well, you're going to save a lot of time and stress. Yes, you're going to have to invest some time upfront to do the organization, but ultimately, you are going to save a lot of time in the future, and that's going to lead to a variety of benefits. You'll see increased productivity and faster turnaround times. And I think this one is probably pretty obvious because, clearly, if you no longer have to spend a bunch of time searching for your designs, images, and templates, you're going to have more time to dedicate to actually creating the content that you need inside of Canva. Or, to focus on the tasks and projects that actually move the needle in your business, like sales and marketing and supporting your existing clients. And you're also going to absolutely see reduced stress and frustration. I think most business owners have been in a situation where they know they created something in the past that they'd really like to reuse as a starting point. Maybe it's a presentation, or an Instagram design, or a lead magnet, whatever it is, you may recall that you created something a month, or three months, or six months ago that you'd like to reuse so you don't have to start from scratch.

[00:04:48.710] - Brenda
Without an organizational system, you're going to find yourself scrolling to find that design, and inevitably, the frustration is going to settle in and you're going to waste time. With an organized Canva filing cabinet, you're going to spend a lot less effort searching for specific designs or images, which in turn is absolutely going to reduce any friction or frustration you're feeling while working in Canva. Your organization is also going to result in a more efficient team. When you have a team that needs to access the content in your Canva account, a hot mess filing disaster is not going to lead to great team efficiency. But if you have a well-organized Canva account, your team members are going to be able to find what they need faster so they can complete projects in less time. And finally, an organization system is going to provide you with a more clear focus, because you'll be able to eliminate the distractions and clutter that come with a disorganized workspace. When you know where everything is in your Canva account, you're not going to waste precious mental energy searching for the assets you need or getting sidetracked by irrelevant designs.

[00:05:52.760] - Brenda
Instead, you can focus your attention on the task at hand, knowing that everything you need is right where it should be. So, I think you get the point. And that point is that ultimately, there is a cost to Canva disorganization. And when you know how to create an organized system, and when you carve out a bit of time to implement that system, you are going to be able to create your Canva content much faster and with a lot less frustration. So, let's get into the how-tos and an FYI that most of the features I'm going to talk about in this training are available on both the free Canva plan as well as the Canva Pro subscription. There are three specific differences that I'll address, but for the most part, you will be able to apply the features and steps we talk about today, regardless of which plan you're on. The first thing I want to highlight is that for effective organization inside of Canva, you should not be working from Canva's home screen. Anytime I do a Canva training and I talk about organization, there is always a question related to how to organize the home screen so that it feels less overwhelming.

[00:06:57.780] - Brenda
And the answer is that you currently can't impose any organization or reordering of the content on Canva's home screen, which is why I want you to get used to coming down here to the Projects section of Canva. You will have complete control over creating folders and batch- organizing designs and images within the Projects section of your Canva account, but you don't have the same capability on your Canva homepage. Instead, the home screen is simply going to list all of the designs you've worked in with the most recently edited designs at the top. For this reason, I do recommend browsing for your designs directly from the Projects tab and skipping the homepage altogether. Inside of Projects, you'll find a couple of default folders that Canva creates, including Starred and Uploads. The Starred folder is where you can save your favorite or frequently used elements and templates. Basically, you can bookmark or star elements and templates that you like in Canva's library so that you can easily access them later on. For example, when you're in the template library, if you see a template that you want to refer to again later, you can hover over the top of it and click on the star icon, and then you'll find it shows up in the default Starred folder.

[00:08:11.450] - Brenda
You can also star a template from within the design editor by hovering over the template, clicking on the three dots, and then clicking the star. And you can do the same thing with graphics. So, for example, in the photos or the icons section in the template library, or when you're in the design editor in the elements area, if you see an element that you would like to favorite for future use, you can again click on the star to save it in the Starred folder. The other default folder you'll see is Uploads, which is one that you'll likely know well, as this is most often where you will have uploaded your own images into your Canva account. Finally, if you're on a free Canva plan, you'll likely also see a Purchased folder, which contains any design elements and templates that you have purchased or licensed from Canva's Premium Library. If you're on a Canva Pro or Teams plan, you'll have access to all elements and templates as part of your subscription, so there's no need for a Purchased folder. So, those are the default folders, but you can also create your own custom folders and subfolders in Canva.

[00:09:15.070] - Brenda
And in a minute, we'll talk about the mechanics of how to do that. But before we get to that, let's finish our little tour of the projects area. And on the left-hand side of the screen, you'll have your navigation for Projects. Note that your sidebar may look a little different by the time you watch this presentation. Canva has been doing a lot of modifications in this area, and it may still be in flux. So, if you do see something a little different, that's why. At the top of that left-side navigation, you can click on All Projects to go back to the main top-level Projects page at any time. You can click on Your Projects to see only the content that you have created or added, or you can click on Shared with You to see designs and images that have been shared with you from other accounts. Below those options, you will see a list of some of your recently opened designs, and then a little further down will be a list of all your custom folders. Also, if you have a custom folder that you want to regularly refer to, you can also star your folders.

[00:10:10.970] - Brenda
And this is different from the starring that I talked about earlier with templates and elements. Whereas those items end up in your Starred folder, when you choose to star one of your folders, it will be added to the primary Canva sidebar navigation. So, you'll see it here on the left-hand side on the main Canva dashboard. So let's briefly go through the mechanics of creating custom folders. You'll start by going to the Projects area. And if you've never created folders before in your Canva account, you can now do so by clicking on the Add New button that you'll find in the top right corner of your Projects page. When you do that, you'll have the option to add a folder. You'll give your folder a name, and then you'll click on Continue to create it. And then to create a sub-folder, you'll just walk through the same process. But instead of doing it at the top-level of Projects, you'll do it inside of one of your existing folders. So, step one is to open the folder where you want the sub-folder to live. Then, again, click on the Add New Button in the top right corner, and once again, choose to add a new folder.

[00:11:11.920] - Brenda
Then give the folder a name and click on the Continue button to create it. And then you can continue to create folders inside of folders as needed, and you can create an unlimited number of folders. The only limitation to be aware of is that you can only nest folders 10 levels deep. For example, I might create a main folder in Projects called Social Media to house all of my social media content designs. Inside of that folder, I could have a folder for Facebook, one for Instagram, one for Pinterest. And then perhaps inside of the Instagram folder, I might have a folder for designs, meant for my Instagram feed, and a separate folder for Instagram Reel Designs. If part of your blogging business includes digital product creation, you may also have a lot of your own templates that you sell or use as lead magnets. If that sounds like you, I would suggest that you consider keeping a separate folder for the templates that you've purchased or downloaded from other template creators, which you can break down into subfolders for each of those template source websites. And then keep that separate from your own Canva templates that you've created.

[00:12:17.110] - Brenda
So, for example, at my top-level of Projects, I have a templates folder that houses the templates I've gotten from other creators. And then I have a Digital Products folder that houses all of my own creations. Some other examples of folders you might want to create under your Digital Products folder are things like Design Assets, which could be broken down into various types of elements like backgrounds, icons, textures, shadows, etc. Plus, all bloggers are likely to have a multitude of size variations of the graphics they've created to support their blogging efforts. In fact, you probably have multiple versions of the same image. For example, you might create an image for your blog that is re-sized and re-purposed for all of your social media platforms. For example, Instagram posts, IG story graphics, Pinterest pins, LinkedIn images, and so on. As a result, over time, you may end up with hundreds or thousands of the same or similar designs in different sizes. Though, I'm sure it probably feels like you have millions of them. There is no single right answer in terms of how to organize your designs. And what works for you to find your designs may be very different than how someone else browses to find their past Canva designs.

[00:13:28.850] - Brenda
I talked about how you can break a Social Media folder down into subfolders for each social channel, and you may find that works for you. Or maybe you prefer having all your designs for a particular graphic size in a single design with multiple pages, and then creating a new design for each month. Or maybe you like to keep your blog post graphics organized by blog post rather than by the document type. As I said, there is no one-size-fits-all approach here, and you'll need to ask yourself how you would intuitively browse for your designs and create a folder system to support that. You may need to experiment with folder arrangements until you find something that best supports your browsing style. In preparation for this presentation, I did some surveying across a variety of blogger groups, and many complained of having tons of uploads and having to scroll through all of them to find the right images. You can also create folders to organize all of your images into categories to make it easier to find what you're looking for. As I just mentioned in the folder examples, you might have a folder for Design Assets, and then you could break it down into image subfolders for elements like backgrounds, icons, textures, and so on.

[00:14:37.210] - Brenda
Or if you use styled stock photos in your own marketing designs, you might have a folder for Styled Stock Photos that is then broken down by source website, and then further broken down into subfolders by subject matter or by color palette. A lot of people don't realize that you do not have to store all of your images in the Uploads folder. And to be honest, I would strongly advise against doing that because it just becomes a bottomless pit of images that makes it practically impossible to find what you're looking for over time. Now, I know many of you have chaotic Uploads folders, and image organization is an enormous, overwhelming challenge for a lot of Canva users. In fact, you have probably found yourself re-uploading the same image multiple times because you can't find it. You're going to be able to avoid that in the future if you have a clear organizational system for your images as well as your designs. If you want to continue using your Uploads folder, start to get into the habit of treating it like a temporary holding spot. Think of uploads like the in-tray on a physical office desk. And just like that in-tray, you don't want to treat the Uploads folder like a long-term storage solution.

[00:15:47.790] - Brenda
Once you're done with an image, move it into a more permanent folder, archive it, or delete it if you don't require it in the future. Or better yet, skip Uploads altogether and directly upload your images into the desired custom folder right from the start, rather than uploading it into your Uploads folder first and having to move it later. And you'll see that you can access your custom folders inside the design editor through the Projects tab. Also, I would encourage you to be mindful of how you are naming your designs. When you have as many image versions as many bloggers do, your naming conventions are going to be really important in addition to your folder organization. Because at a glance, a lot of your design thumbnails will probably look nearly identical, given that they are variations of the same design. You want to name your designs consistently, ensuring that the design name is descriptive and that it includes any keywords you might search to find the design. And that's because while having an organized folder system is really important, one of the fastest ways to find a specific design will often be to use the search field at the top of your page.

[00:16:52.850] - Brenda
That said, Canva has made searching even easier for you now with the introduction of the ability to search for keywords that appear not just in the name of your design file, but also any keywords that appear in the design itself. Media tagging can be very helpful as well in terms of searching for your image assets, and you can add tags to both images and video. Media tagging is only available on a Canva Pro account. So, if you do have a free plan when you go to access this feature, you'll be prompted to upgrade. You can access tagging by hovering over an image and clicking on the three dots. Then you'll see here that you have an option to add keyword tags. This is going to make it much easier for you to search for any image content in your Canva account in the future. So, for example, I could add the keyword framework to this image. And then if I search on framework in the search bar and hit Enter, you'll see that the image now shows up in my search results for that term, even though framework isn't in the name of the image file.

[00:17:52.310] - Brenda
Once you have your folders set up, it's going to be time to start moving your designs and images into their new homes. So, let's briefly walk through the steps to batch-organize inside Canva. If you've ever hovered over a Canva design or image, you'll have noticed that a checkbox appears and that you can select multiple designs or images at a time by checking off those checkboxes. When you select multiple files, you'll notice that a folder icon appears in the bottom middle of the page next to a trash icon. When you hover over that folder icon, it will say move to folder. And when you click on the folder icon, you will have the ability to choose which folder to move the designs to. You can locate a folder through this area called Recent, which shows the most recently accessed folders. Or, you can browse through all of your Project folders to find the desired folder, or you can search for a desired folder by searching on the folder name in this search bar. Once you've chosen the destination folder, you'll simply click on the option to move the files, and then Canva will move all of those files off of your Projects page and into your chosen folder.

[00:18:58.640] - Brenda
If you find that when you move files into a folder, it's not actually moving off of the main Projects page, there are a couple of things I want you to try for troubleshooting. First, try refreshing your browser tab after you've moved files to see if that files them away into the folders, and often it does. Same thing if you've deleted files from your Projects page and you're not seeing them deleted right away. Sometimes it just needs a page refresh to show the update. The second thing you can try is to make sure that this filter area on the projects page is set to show only your designs and not any designs shared with you. So, you can see how I filtered my projects here to only show designs and media from the Brenda Cadman account. So, let's move on to do a quick overview of a framework that you can use to help you get organized in Canva. When I teach how to get organized in my Clean Up My Canva course, I teach two different methods. First is the 'tackle the mess' approach, which is for those folks who are ready to organize all of their existing designs and images and to create an intuitive Canva organization system.

[00:20:01.920] - Brenda
And depending on how many designs and images you have in your account, this could be a potentially time-consuming project, though still very worthwhile. And if you have the bandwidth to do this, it is the approach that I definitely recommend. The second option is the 'start fresh' method. One of the biggest reasons that folks who know they need to get organized in Canva, and who want to get organized but still haven't done it, is because they have an absolutely overwhelming backlog of designs and images. So, this is the option for those Canva users who feel like their account is an organizational pit of despair and who have zero energy to organize it, but who want to be organized going forward. What I want to do in this video is to give you a quick overview of the 'tackle the mess' approach. Because since you're watching this training today, that likely means you already have a hot mess account that you would like to impose some order on. So, I'm going to walk you through five steps, and once you're comfortable with the organizing process, you will likely find that you're able to do more than one step concurrently.

[00:21:08.180] - Brenda
But I'd suggest breaking it down into steps when you're new to the process. The first step is focused on deleting and archiving your unneeded Canva designs and images. If you were organizing piles of paper in an office or a filing cabinet, you would start by disposing of the papers that you no longer need. You would also archive into long-term storage the documents that you may need for reference, but that you're no longer actively using. The same process applies for your digital content, including your Canva designs. So, I'd recommend you take a stroll down Canva memory lane and review all of the designs in your Canva account. Delete any of the designs that you know you don't need. So, for example, you may have copies of the templates you never ended up using; duplicates of designs you thought you would need but didn't; designs that are super outdated that you know you won't need, and so on. For those of you who are afraid to let go of any designs in case you might need it in the future, I would encourage you to create an archive folder and then move all of those 'But what if I need it down the road?' designs into that folder.

[00:22:16.650] - Brenda
If you haven't needed to access those archive designs in the next year, chances are good that you will feel safer doing a purge of them down the road. Next up is to do a review of what's left in your Canva account after you've finished deleting and archiving, and to update your naming conventions. If you're like most Canva users, you probably have a lot of designs named things like copy of template XYZ, or design version two and design version three and version four, etc. Or you've labeled it with a really generic name like Instagram post without providing any further description about which Instagram post it is, should you want to find it later. It's important to name your files in a descriptive manner so that you can easily tell at a glance what all of your designs are from the outside, and also so you can more easily search for your designs using the Canva search bar. And as I said, once you're comfortable using the organization features in Canva, you're going to be able to do more than one step concurrently. So, for example, while I'm working through an account to delete or archive content, I might simultaneously be renaming designs.

[00:23:23.520] - Brenda
Your third step is going to be to plan and create your folders. Write down a list of all the categories and subcategories you think you'll need to organize your designs, your images, and your videos. There is no one-size-fits-all solution about how to break down your folders within Canva. Some of you will only need a small handful of folders. Others will need a really robust filing system. As an example, my own Canva account is broken down into multiple folders, as you can see here. And then those primary folders are further broken down into subfolders as needed. I would recommend not having more top-level folders than you can see without scrolling. I have 12, and I find that 12 to 13 is usually the maximum that feels manageable before you start having too many choices and feeling overwhelmed. Once you have your initial list of folders, you can start actually creating your custom folders and subfolders in order to begin building your own Canva filing cabinet. Or you may find it makes more sense to create your folders as you go through the category creation process, whatever feels most natural for you. Once you've got your folders set up so that your designs and images all have homes, you can use the batch-organizing technique that I talked about earlier in order to begin moving all of your files into your new folders.

[00:24:38.650] - Brenda
And one of the best ways to start this process is to look for categories of designs, where you know there's going to be large chunks that you can move at a time. For example, if I'm doing an organization VIP day for a graphic designer that I know has tons of designs and assets for clients, I will start by selecting anything that I know can go into that top-level clients folder. I'm not going to worry at this stage about only selecting designs for a specific client. I'll tackle that later when I go through the client's folder. To start, you're just trying to organize your designs and images into those top-level categories, and then you can work your way down. And your final step will be to maintain your organization. Once you finish getting through the first four steps of this process, your organization system should be in good shape. But even the best system will fall apart if you don't maintain your Canva account. You can create a recurring task on your calendar or your project management tool of choice to do your Canva organization on a weekly, biweekly or even on a monthly basis.

[00:25:37.400] - Brenda
And I'd also recommend a periodic deep clean of your Canva account to review the content of your folders, and to delete and archive again as needed. This doesn't need to be very often, but this will also give you an opportunity to reassess your folder system and whether it's still working for you. Before I wrap things up, I want to address one more question that I hear fairly often whenever I talk to folks about getting organized in Canva, and that is how to get started cleaning up your Canva account if you've started the process, but things kind of stopped part way through. If you have a half-organized account, the first thing I would recommend is to assess why it's only partially organized. If you've already created a folder system with the intention of organizing your designs, but you've found it difficult to use, you'll want to ask yourself if you have the right folders in place. And you'll need to re-evaluate the content in your Canva account to determine what folder structure would actually make sense for you. If you're feeling too much friction with your existing folder setup, then it's most likely not the right one for you.

[00:26:41.640] - Brenda
And you'll need to adjust it so that you can create a filing system that's consistently easy to use and to maintain. Folder friction doesn't mean that you should abandon the idea of using folders in Canva. It means there is likely a folder structure that would be better and more effective for you to organize and find your content. So, that would be step number one, figure out whether or not your lack of organization is a result of the system that you've started to implement. If you know it's not the folder system that's causing the problem, and the reason it's only partially organized is because you simply can't find the time, energy, or bandwidth to complete the organization, then it may just be a matter of figuring out how to tackle it in smaller chunks or putting aside all of your old designs into a folder to tackle at a later date. So, you can just move forward with a clean slate until you're able to chip away at your past designs, or delegating the remaining organization project to somebody else to finish up. For example, if you have an assistant, if you have another team member, if you have a business partner who is more interested in the administrative side of things, it might be worth considering if you have to be the person to finish the organization project.

[00:27:49.960] - Brenda
I mentioned earlier that there were three organization related differences in the free Canva plan as compared to Canva Pro. I already talked about media tagging only being available on Pro, but there are a couple more differences to be aware of, and those are specifically the number of items you can store in a folder and the total storage space allotted to your account. In terms of the number of items you can have in a folder on the free plan, you can have 200 items, whereas on Canva Pro, it's 1,000 items. And in terms of storage on a free plan, you'll have five gigabytes of space, whereas you'll have one terabyte of storage space on Canva Pro. So, if you have a lot of images or videos that you're organizing in your account, you're going to find that storage space gets used up fairly quickly, whereas you'll have a lot more storage capacity on a Pro account. Otherwise, your experience using and moving content into folders should be the same, regardless of which plan you're on. But if you are on Canva's free plan and you want to test out Canva's Pro subscription for free, I do have a 45-day free trial that you can take advantage of.

[00:28:56.790] - Brenda
That's one of the perks of being a Canva-verified expert. I get to offer a 45-day trial instead of the usual 30-day trial. At the end of the day, I don't like to spend money on things that don't hold value for me. So, I definitely recommend that you try out the pro features for yourself to see if the value is there for you before you spend any money on it. If this training has inspired you to tackle your own Canva clutter, I have a resource that you may want to check out, and that is my Canva Organization Roadmap. It's a free guide that will essentially walk you through that framework from this training in a little more detail, in a format that you can more easily reference while you're actually tackling your own organization. You can grab a copy of that at brendacadman.com/roadmap. I sincerely hope this training was helpful for you and that you picked up a tip or two to help you create a more efficient Canva account.
