Welcome to how to grow your recurring revenue for your membership, group, program or agency with retentions and referrals. Today, we're going to be covering how to identify the three most important numbers to grow that recurring revenue monthly, month over month. We're also going to talk about how to calculate your lost revenue and how you could be leaving money on the table if you don't actually look at your retention.

[00:00:35.310] - Melody
Number three, we're going to be talking about how to identify what your monthly recurring revenue number is to track your goals. Lastly, we're going to talk about how to use your existing customers to promote your services, products, and so much more. Here's what you probably already know. Students that stay in your program and implement actually grow your recurring revenue. If you have a membership or a group coaching program, you know how costly it is in time and money that it takes to actually acquire new customers. And there's actually some statistics and data that identify that new customers cost 5 to 25 times more. Meaning that if you've already put in the hard effort of actually getting new leads and new clients and new students, it really is more cost-effective to really support those customers long term.

[00:01:31.790] - Melody
Students that stay in your program and implement actually grows your recurring revenue. So, as I mentioned, if you have a membership or a group coaching program, you really want to focus on how to grow that recurring revenue. And that actually can be done in two ways get new customers or focus on helping your customers become repeat customers or customers for life. What you already know is that you've done the hard work.

[00:01:58.180] - Melody
You have a course, maybe a digital product, a membership or group coaching program, and you've gotten to the point where you've converted them into a sale. But the problem is, there's a lot of people who look at the entire customer journey as a one sided process. Meaning you get the customer and then what? You don't want to leave people hanging in order to just think only about the conversion, meaning people who actually purchase your products, memberships or coaching programs or services. You want to look at ways that actually leverage the entire customer journey from start to finish.

[00:02:35.090] - Melody
As I mentioned, you lose potential clients at each stage. This means that if you're doing the hard work of generating traffic through, let's say, social media, search engine optimization, from your blog post, maybe a YouTube channel, or even a podcast, you've done all that hard lifting of getting people to the page. Why not actually help to optimize the back end of your customer journey? So, here in this visual, I'm actually breaking down an example of what that might look like. And keep in mind, these numbers are completely made up. This is just an example of what this could look like for you if you have an existing audience and you're already generating folks to join your email list or newsletter and get them to learn more about your services and products.

[00:03:23.040] - Melody
So, let's say that you have 2000 landing page visits to your home page. From the home page, people then opt in to your free resource. These convert to, let's say 600 leads. Then from there, maybe you have a master class or you have a webinar. There's 240 people that watch that webinar. From there, there's 24 applications to your one on one services, or maybe your high ticket group coaching program or your membership. From there, let's say that you have a pretty low conversion rate. Two to four conversions are actually being available to you at the time of all that hard work. Now, again, all of these conversions and metrics are all just an example. Your conversion rate might be higher or lower and your traffic again could be higher or lower than this. So again, keep that in mind. But as I'm showing you in this visual, you are losing potential clients at each stage. What I want to talk about today is how important it is to think about customer retention.

[00:04:27.610] - Melody
Customer retention is highly profitable. If we already took a look at how we're losing customers at each stage, we really need to think about the entire customer journey. This visual is something called the bow tie funnel. And I really think it's important to think about the overall customer journey of where your customers are not only joining you at the beginning stages of them getting to know you, but also how you can get your customers to become customers that will be repeat business and grow your recurring revenue month over month. Now, if you're at all aware of the customer journey, some people like to call it a funnel.

[00:05:05.190] - Melody
I think about this as the entire relationship that you have with your customers throughout the time that you are connected with them. Let's say that someone starts with just some simple brand awareness. This could be anything from social media posts. It could be even in person events, virtual events. This is getting people to understand a little bit more about you, what your brand is about and how you can support them in achieving their goals.

[00:05:31.940] - Melody
From there, they might be interested in your specific business that might look like interest by looking at your website, following you on social media, or joining your newsletter. From there, you might also have some engagement, maybe somebody comments on your social media posts. You might also then have people join your newsletter and then they decide, hey, what's the next step in working with you? This consideration stage is very, very critical and most marketers focus specifically from the consideration phase into the purchase phase, meaning they're only looking for that top dollar sale. But in reality, no matter what kind of business that you are operating, we want to look at the overall customer cycle. This means that we need to focus not only on what happens when the customer joins you, but what happens at the end of that customer journey.

[00:06:28.190] - Melody
And that is the beauty of the bow tie funnel. You get people to purchase. They complete an onboarding process with you. They adopt that product, meaning they actually consume the content that you work so hard to create. If you have a digital course, you know what I mean, they advocate for you because they love your product. And you also endear them to customer loyalty, meaning that they're not only looking at ways that they can work with you for that one time course or purchase, they're looking at working with you and a deeper level within a membership group coaching program or some sort of recurring revenue stream.

[00:07:05.450] - Melody
Another way to look at this is really, again, focusing on what happens after the sale. You have that post purchase, people are using the product, meaning they're actually consuming whatever it is that you created and you build that brand loyalty. Over time, they're going to advocate for you. And that's the beauty of referrals. People will really recommend people to the products and services that they really enjoy. If you have an official referral program, this is where you can actually grow your recurring revenue to promote your products and services in a way that makes sense for you, your business and your overall customer journey.

[00:07:45.750] - Melody
Now, what happens when someone actually is trying to consume your course or your product or your membership or your group program? Sometimes people ask me what can I do to help my customers see success? I know that my customers really do need all of the key pieces inside my curriculum, but they're not taking action. What I find often is the case to get people to engage in the curriculum is really not focusing on the completion of the course, but it's actually helping people achieve smaller bite sized pieces of information. So, I do have a habit, and I will admit this, of always wanting to over stuff my course content.

[00:08:29.620] - Melody
That may mean something like adding another module. But what we really want to do is you want to break this down. And here on the right side, you're going to see a visual that says big learning goal, smaller goal and then learning objective.

[00:08:42.940] - Melody
Essentially what this is is it's a breakdown of the most important pieces of information that's going to be broken down. So, people can take a ladder. Meaning they're going to take miniature steps towards the overall outcome of the course or program. These are what I consider milestones for the customers. You break down the outcomes and goals into stepping stones or milestones for your customers. This might look like one, breaking things down to help people see the foundations of your curriculum. Two, actually showing people a quick how to, something that can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, ideally less than five. Three, something that people can actually see success, and then four, they'll be able to get one step closer or a few steps closer to achieving their goal.

[00:09:32.270] - Melody
So you see, this is the kind of ladder that we want people to look at. They're moving through each step. They're seeing success. And you create that momentum for people to see that your framework works for them. Now the real question is, how do you keep the customer that you already have? Let's say, you have an online course and you want them to join your membership or you want them to join your group coaching program. Well, the first thing we need to do is how do we keep that customer buying from us and how do we support them achieving their goals?

[00:10:06.990] - Melody
Because we want to create that momentum and that relationship that's going to support their overall growth goals. Now let's say you have a membership and you're thinking, well, the people in my membership or the people in my group coaching program have a lot of momentum, but they're just not actually staying in my membership. They're canceling. They're not really taking action.

[00:10:32.000] - Melody
How can I keep these folks that have worked so hard to get inside of the membership or group coaching program? Or rather, if you're just starting with the membership or group coaching program, what should you think about to keep people from staying and actually implementing? We want to think about this in two ways. We're planning for people to stay in our membership or we are analyzing why people are not staying. Okay.

[00:10:59.960] - Melody
So, we're looking at this in a way that we want to grow that recurring revenue stream. So, we need to find out how much money are we losing or how much money could we lose if we don't focus on it?

[00:11:09.910] - Melody
So, what is churn? Churn is basically the rate at which we're losing customers. Obviously, the more people in our membership or group coaching program, the more that we grow our recurring revenue.

[00:11:21.120] - Melody
What we want to do is actually is do a little bit of a math problem here. And don't worry, I'm going to walk you through this. If you're not actually a good person at math, I have a free calculator that helps calculate all of this. And here's really the key. You want to calculate lost revenue by customers lost during the month over the customers at the beginning of the month. If you have a membership between forty seven dollars to ninety seven dollars or more, this revenue calculator is going to be really, really helpful for you. Again, thinking about customers lost during the month over customers at the beginning of the month. Your churn rate examples will be customers lost during the month over customers at the beginning of the month.

[00:12:03.770] - Melody
As an example, let's say that you have a thousand people inside of your program, 50 people were lost during the beginning or excuse me, at the end of the month. And that calculates to a churn rate of 5%. So, conversely, if someone's saying hey, I want to have people staying my membership long term, churn is bad. We don't want people leaving the membership if they truly can benefit from your program.

[00:12:29.230] - Melody
And what we want to do is actually decrease that number. We want to decrease our churn rate and increase our retention. I want to talk specifically about how this relates to your goals to grow your recurring revenue. So, there's two things we want to focus on growing our revenue but also keeping the members that we have already inside. So, we're going to enter in our new monthly retention goal.

[00:12:54.170] - Melody
So, again, we're talking about is retention is good, churn rate is bad. Every single month, we need to increase our retention, keeping the members in and we want to help the people see success. So that overall our annual retention goal is actually increasing and not decreasing. So, we want to keep our members inside and we want to keep that retention goal a decent percent. And then what we're going to do is enter the total amount of annual recovered revenue. Because once you recover some potential leads that have really not actually taken action. Let's say that, you know, you have a retention goal of 5% increase over the course of one year and you want to see how much money you could bring back. That number for the recovered revenue is going to actually show you how much money inside the calculator you could be making.

[00:13:56.750] - Melody
So, let's say your recovered revenue is $2,000 or $20,000, especially if you have a high ticket group coaching program if you keep just 5%. So, this is just an example of that breakdown. Number two, important, number two review is your monthly recurring revenue. This is the total number of customers that you have multiplied by the average price. MRR is another way of saying monthly recurring revenue. Obviously, the higher, the better. So, what do you want to do to grow your recurring revenue? Well, you have to look at where you are now and where you want to be.

[00:14:40.280] - Melody
Are people staying in your membership? If you haven't created your membership yet, what do you need to do to help people see success? And then alternatively and additionally, we want to think about your revenue for your goals. Are you looking at growing your recurring revenue? Let's say, you have a membership and you're making $500 a month in recurring revenue. Do you want to make a $1,000 next month in recurring revenue? Well, we need to plan that out and we have to focus on these key numbers. Another important number is to consider your calculated monthly ARPA or average revenue per account.

[00:15:23.080] - Melody
So, basically, you want to think about how much is the average product price or the average revenue that's generated per client account. Now, there's a lot of different tools and resources that I'm going to include in a worksheet to show you some important numbers and how to access this. But I do want to recommend that you take a look at finding out what's the average revenue per account.

[00:15:45.920] - Melody
That has a lot to do with your products, your pricing, and a lot more. The other thing you want to think about is your customer lifetime value.

[00:15:55.010] - Melody
This is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship. So, imagine if you were Starbucks and your calculated customer lifetime value would be the length of the time that someone is a consumer of Starbucks, right? So, obviously, the higher the customer lifetime value, the higher the profits because you did all this marketing, somebody actually bought from you and they're now going to come to you again and again. So, customer lifetime value is another thing that you want to increase.

[00:16:28.020] - Melody
Now, if you want to grow your recurring revenue with repeat clients, I definitely recommend taking notes on this next step. We talked about repeat business and how profitable that is for your business revenue overall. Some examples of expansion revenue from your existing customer base are essentially these three examples, but these are just the start. You probably may already be doing this or thinking about doing this, but this is really what businesses do to grow their revenue. Number one is annual or quarterly retreats. If you're thinking about having a retreat either in person or virtual, this is a great way for you to expand your customer revenue base. Number two, a monthly membership.

[00:17:09.760] - Melody
This can be something specific to growing your recurring revenue for your membership or creating an additional package pricing for your membership, therefore creating a new revenue stream based off of your existing services that you offer for your clients. You can also offer a VIP day or a one on one intensive. There are plenty of ways for you to grow your recurring revenue based off of your existing customers. So, if you're wondering what expansion revenue is, it's basically booked revenue outside of the original initial purchase, product or service. So, for example, your first product could be a mini-course. From the mini-course, you can then introduce them to a group coaching program. From the group coaching program, you might then expand that to a retreat. From the retreat, you might expand that to a one on one intensive, VIP day, a retainer for a service, et cetera. You can go on and on. Expansion revenue is profitable and we want to grow it over time. There are two types of expansion revenue.

[00:18:11.190] - Melody
Many of which you probably have heard of or are familiar with these terms, upselling and cross-selling. Essentially, what you're doing is you're providing an additional option for people to work with you either in an automated fashion, like through a funnel or customer journey, or through a way where people can actually learn about something that's complementary to the services that you're offering, like cross-selling. So, upselling might be, hey, if you want to grab access to the membership, you can also license part of it where you can use it for your clients, add an additional fee that would be upselling, you're consuming more of that product. Again, if you think about when you go to a restaurant, they might say, hey, do you want to supersize this? It's using generally more of what you're already using. Cross-selling is maybe a fries where you're actually saying hey, I would like it if you liked the burger, you might also want to consider grabbing the fries. So, this could be the bump sell offer or an upsell, which is a completely different product from the original product that you're selling. So, again, lots of different things to think about. Now, here's some simple ways that you can do to boost profits and engagement from your existing customer base with a referral program, I like to use something called a referral packet, but other people like to call it something else.

[00:19:37.290] - Melody
So, what you want to do is you want to create a way that's easy and simple for people to learn more about your services and refer you business through a very streamlined way. You can send referrals to a complete onboarding packet. You can ask your referral team to send people to your free lead magnet. So, this is something that I do within my affiliate software, which is a tool that I use where I actually send people directly to a free lead magnet. Or if I'm doing something live like a challenge or some sort of training series, I recommend that the affiliates or referral folks actually send people to that direct link that's customized to the specific user or referral partner. Another thing that you can do is growing your income with a low ticket product, this could be either a mini course, a masterclass, or freebie. You can also send people directly through a booking page or to your Facebook group. There's so many different ways that you can send people to the newsletter and grow your email list and also grow your sales. So, lots of ways to grow your referral program.

[00:20:48.830] - Melody
The referral packet I talked about is just a great way to also use the customers that have already seen the success from your membership or your group coaching program or your products, and actually, using that resource to help promote your products to build that brand advocacy. You can add in additional information like how to sign up for your referral program, payout details, and marketing assets like graphics, et cetera. Lots of different ways. All right. So, we have talked quite a bit about ways to grow your recurring revenue. We've talked about how you can not only grow your recurring revenue, we talked about ways that you can increase your profitability by using retention. We talked about some important numbers like your average revenue per account, your monthly recurring revenue number, and how it's important to think about this in context with supporting your customers, so that they can actually advocate for you and become a customer long term.

[00:21:52.090] - Melody
We also talked about how to grow your recurring revenue and how you can use expansion revenue to build off of the customer base that you already have.

[00:22:01.660] - Melody
We talked about some numbers and key calculations, so there's a free calculator that I have. I'm going to share a little bit more about this later on, but it is a calculator. You can take a look at it. It's called the retention, calculator. It's entering all the numbers that you have that you can calculate the retention calculator of what you can do to customize your retention long term.

[00:22:25.240] - Melody
So while we've talked a lot about this, you're probably wondering I need some help to actually grow my group coaching program. And I want to be able to leverage word-of-mouth referrals and also support my ongoing efforts in my business with retention. One of the things that you can do to grow your recurring revenue is network with other course creators and digital product owners. Podcast guests are also another great way to get word out about your products and programs. One of the things that you can do is head on over to the thecourseconsultant.com/coursecollaborationdirectory, and you'll be able to share about your specific offers by listing your business in a free online business directory.

[00:23:19.240] - Melody

Also, if you found some of the information here useful, I am going to be including a free worksheet that you can use some of these calculations to grow your recurring revenue. So, make sure to check out the workbook activity where it's going to go more in-depth into the activities referenced from today.
