Eb Gargano [00:00:12]:
Hi. I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging. I am delighted to be here speaking again at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. This year, I am gonna be talking about how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. Let's dive in, shall we? Okay. So before we get started, I want to ask you if you identify with any or all of the following statements. So a, I am not earning as much money as I would like to be earning, b, I live in constant fear of the next Google update, c, I feel like I'm on a perpetual hamster wheel working, working, working, but never getting any closer to my goals. D, every new curveball leaves me feeling like I want to cut my losses and throw in the towel.

Eb Gargano [00:01:02]:
So, if you identified with any or all of those statements, you are not alone. Making money online has become harder, more competitive, and less reliable over the last few years. And threats from AI, increasingly tough competition, and some pretty brutal Google updates recently mean the traditional blogging model is becoming ever more precarious and ever harder to win at. But what if I told you there is a way to break free from the overwhelm, frustration, and stress of that perpetual hamster wheel? What if I told you there is a way to completely stop worrying about Google updates and random curveballs? And what if I told you that it is completely possible to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic? It's time to get excited, very excited because what I'm about to reveal to you has the potential to change not just your blogging business but your whole life. Okay. So in this training, I am gonna show you the simple money making equation and why most bloggers are focusing on the wrong side of the equation, how to make good money online without living in fear of the next Google update, how to make your blogging business much less precarious and much more protected from those random curveballs, and most importantly, how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. But before we carry on, I want to very briefly introduce myself so that you know who I am, why I am qualified to talk about all of this. So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Eb Gugano and I'm the founder of Easy Peasy Foodie and Productive Blogging.

Eb Gargano [00:02:55]:
I'm also a course creator and ebook author. I've written 5 books and I've created 7 online courses and one membership program. And I teach bloggers and online business owners how to be more strategic with their time so they can earn more while working less. I've helped over 3,000 paying students build more successful online businesses through my ebooks, courses, and my membership program, the Digital Product Success Academy. And when I am not working, I love lifting weights, drinking wine, and learning Spanish on Duolingo, but not all at the same time. So I spend a lot of time talking to bloggers and online business owners. And whenever I ask them about their goals, so often the reply I get back is more traffic, increase my monthly page views, get more readers, hit 50,000 sessions. And there's a really good reason for that.

Eb Gargano [00:03:56]:
There's a strong correlation between page views and income, especially if your site is monetized by ads and or affiliates. But here's the thing, nobody really wants more page views. After all, you can't pay your mortgage with page views, you can't pay your bills with page views, You can't eat page views. Page views won't buy you a fancy car or a luxury holiday. Bloggers say they want more page views because more page views equals more money. But increasing your page views is only one half of the income equation and I would argue most of the time not the best one. You see, your blogging income is based on one simple calculation. Number of page views times the amount of money you make per page view.

Eb Gargano [00:04:53]:
The amount of money you make per page view is usually expressed as RPM, which technically means, rate per mille or rate per 1,000 page views. That means if you want to 10 x your blog income, there are 2 things you can do. Number 1, 10 x your blog traffic or number 2, 10 x your RPM. So let's look at each one of those in turn. First up, 10 x ing your blog traffic. If you currently earn money from your blog from ads and affiliates, then the most obvious way to 10 x your blog income is by 10 x ing your traffic. For example, if you currently get 50,000 page views and have an RPM of $20, you would be earning $1,000 per month. But if you had 500,000 page views, you would be earning $10,000 per month.

Eb Gargano [00:05:48]:
Now 10 x ing your traffic used to be relatively easy to do. You would just double down on your SEO, do lots of good keyword research, crank out lots of well written, well optimized posts, and in a fairly short space of time, you could significantly increase your monthly pages and therefore significantly increase your monthly blogging income. Unfortunately, thanks to huge increases in competition, major advances in AI, and some pretty brutal Google updates in recent years, 10 x ing your monthly traffic is now very hard and it's getting harder and harder to do. In fact, right now, many bloggers are actually going in the opposite direction. Worse still, the only real way of getting those kind of traffic numbers is Google. So trying to 10 x your traffic makes you ever more dependent on Google. And in the last couple of years, we've seen just how precarious that is. One of my favorite quotes is never put all your eggs in one basket, especially not Google's.

Eb Gargano [00:07:02]:
Relying on any one channel for all or nearly all of your traffic and income is not a business plan. It's a gamble. Never leave yourself at the mercy of any one channel or platform because you have no control over a third party. If one algorithm change can wipe out your entire business overnight, you're doing it wrong. So just a quick reminder, to 10 x your blogging income, you can do one of 2 things. 10 x your page views, which we've just looked at, or 10 x your RPM. So we've just looked at increasing your page views, which is the one that everyone talks about all of the time. So now let's look at the other one, 10x-ing your RPM.

Eb Gargano [00:07:46]:
So let's look at that example again. We already looked at how if you currently get 50,000 page views and have an RPM of $20, you would be earning $1,000 per month. And if you ten x your traffic and had 500,000 page views, you would ten x your blogging income and be earning $10,000 per month. But you could stay on that 50,000 page views figure and instead ten x your RPM. So if you have an RPM of $200 and 50,000 page views a month, you would also be earning $10,000 per month. But how on earth do you do that? How on earth do you get an RPM of $200? Actually, it's surprisingly easy. According to recent research, bloggers who mainly monetize via digital products are earning over 10 times as much as bloggers who mainly monetize via ads or affiliates. This is a graph taken from the blogging income survey and you can see that the RPMs you get from digital products absolutely dwarf those you get from ads and affiliates.

Eb Gargano [00:09:02]:
In fact, according to the data, the average RPM from digital products is $365.94, which means if you have 50,000 page views, you could be earning $18,297 a month from digital products compared to just $1,393 from ads. That is a lot more than 10 x. But why is that? Why are digital product RPMs so much higher than ad RPMs? It's actually quite logical when you think about it. People are only gonna pay to advertise their products if they will earn more from product sales than they will spend advertising their products which means the income per page view is being split between the website which displays the ads and the company paying for the ads. And usually, the company paying for the ads is earning a lot more than the website which displays the ads. Or to put it another way, if you run ads on your site, someone else is earning more from your page views than you are. Selling your own products cuts out the middleman. And the best news, creating and launching a digital product is much, much easier than trying to 10 x your traffic.

Eb Gargano [00:10:32]:
However, just throwing together a quick ebook and popping a link to it somewhere on your website will not magically 10 x your income. If you want to 10 x your blogging income, you need to be much more strategic. You need a step by step plan and that is what this presentation is gonna cover. How to 10 x your income without more traffic, a 4 step plan. Okay. So step 1 is build a solid email foundation. Email marketing is absolutely foundational to the success of a digital product based business. I literally cannot emphasize this enough.

Eb Gargano [00:11:16]:
If you get your email marketing wrong, your digital product business will almost certainly fail. Email marketing runs through every aspect of a successful digital product business. It will help you do market research, validate your ideas, nurture cold traffic into warm leads, and nurture warm leads into customers. It will also help you onboard your new customers, get good testimonials and success stories, and turn happy customers into advocates, repeat customers, and high performing affiliates. I literally do not know of a single successful digital product business owner who does not have a strong email marketing game. So what does a solid email marketing foundation look like? It looks like this. Multiple high converting lead magnets, a strong new subscriber nurture sequence, a good tagging and segmenting strategy to ensure the right subscriber gets the right email at the right time, automations that ensure that new subscribers are guided along a path from new subscriber to happy customer to repeat customer to raving advocate and high performing affiliate. Okay.

Eb Gargano [00:12:34]:
That was step 1. Step 2 is create a product ladder. You see, the thing is you are very unlikely to 10 x your blogging income if you only sell one product. If that product is a low cost product like an ebook, you would need huge traffic volumes to achieve that 10 x figure. But if you only sell one high ticket offer like a signature program, though you need far fewer sales to make a decent income, it is really hard to sell any at all because people just don't trust you enough to part with that much money. So what's the solution? The solution is to build a product ladder. But what is a product ladder? A product ladder is a series of products that takes your target audience step by step along a journey from just stumbling across your website right up to the point where they trust you enough to buy your high ticket offer. Here's an example of what that might look like.

Eb Gargano [00:13:34]:
It starts with your free product, a lead magnet designed to turn casual website visitors into subscribers and give them a quick win. The next rung on the ladder is your low ticket offer, A small product like an ebook that's priced so low that it doesn't require much trust to get the sale. The next rung is your mid price offer. A slightly bigger, slightly more expensive product like a mini course. This will give your customer bigger results and build even more trust. And finally, the top rung is your high ticket offer. This delivers the biggest results for your customers. However, it also has the biggest price tag.

Eb Gargano [00:14:18]:
But because you've built up so much trust along the way, your customers will be willing to pay that price because they know how much value they'll get. Okay. So that is what a product ladder is, but why does it work so well? Well, the thing is the hardest part of all of this is to get people to make the leap from non customer to customer, to go from free product to low ticket offer which is why you price your low ticket offer so attractively, to make it as friction free as possible for someone to make that leap. Once they've made that leap, it is so much easier to sell them something more expensive. If they give you a small amount of money and your product really exceeds their expectations and gives them a significant win, they will be much more likely to trust you with a larger amount of money in the future. It's also easier for you. Creating a signature program if you've never made any kind of digital product before is a huge step and a huge risk. If you get it wrong, that's a lot of time and money that you've wasted.

Eb Gargano [00:15:33]:
By starting small with a low ticket offer, it's less daunting and much less of a risk for you. Better still, you can use the feedback you get from your low ticket offer customers to help you understand your audience better and create better higher ticket offers. This makes the whole process much less risky because you have a better understanding of what your audience truly wants and is willing to pay for and proof that they will actually buy from you. And it makes success with your higher ticket products much more likely because you've gained that trust and because it's so much easier to sell to an existing customer than a non customer. Okay. So step 3 is launch your products the right way. All too often, I see people try to launch digital products by maybe sending one email to their list, maybe doing a little bit of social media, and sticking their new product on their website somewhere, and that's it. That is not a launch and that approach is doomed to failure.

Eb Gargano [00:16:43]:
A proper launch involves a lot more razzmatazz. It involves warming up your list way before your launch. It involves sending emails to your list daily during your launch period. It involves promoting your product on your website and across multiple social channels, and it involves a discount and a deadline. A deadline is really important. Without a deadline, your audience have no incentive to buy now. And we as humans are natural procrastinators. So without a deadline, your audience may see your fabulous new digital product and think, oh, that looks wonderful.

Eb Gargano [00:17:25]:
I am definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But then tomorrow rolls around and they get the next email from you and they think, oh, that looks wonderful. I'm definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But then tomorrow rolls around and they get the next email from you and they think, oh, that looks wonderful. I'm definitely gonna get that tomorrow, and so on. By giving your audience a special launch discount and a deadline after which they can no longer get that discount, they are motivated to act now and they do. And if you want any more evidence for that, ask any digital product creator when they get the most sales and they will tell you in the last hour of the sale. And finally, step 4 is to build an evergreen sales funnel because once you've done your launch, you cannot expect sales to keep rolling in.

Eb Gargano [00:18:20]:
It just doesn't work like that. You're gonna hit up against that exact same problem. New people will discover your website and your products and they will think, oh, that digital product looks wonderful. That's really gonna help me. I am definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But without any kind of deadline, they just won't have any kind of incentive to stop putting that purchase off and so they will keep procrastinating and eventually, probably forget all about you. So what is the solution? Well, you could run a flash sale on your digital product several times a year. But there's a fundamental problem with this.

Eb Gargano [00:18:58]:
Once people discover that you run regular flash sales on your products, the power of urgency is lost. And they will think, oh, I'll just wait for the next flash sale, and the next, and the next. Also, after a time, people come to know you offer regular flash sales and so nobody ever buys at full price. In other words, you have devalued your product. So what is the solution? The solution is to build an evergreen sales funnel. But what is an evergreen sales funnel? An evergreen sales funnel is a type of sales funnel that is automated and can be entered at any time. Typically, you attract people into the top of your sales funnel with a free lead magnet. Once on your list, you will first welcome and nurture your new subscriber before presenting them with an offer, usually a discount off your digital product for a limited time.

Eb Gargano [00:19:56]:
The sales funnel is evergreen because this limited time period is individual for each new subscriber and available all year round. Whenever anyone signs up for your free lead magnet, they'll be given exactly the same amount of time to buy the product at the discount. Once the countdown timer has hit 0, the discount will automatically disappear and they will only have the option to pay full price. So for example, person 1 might sign up for your freebie on Monday 1st at 9 AM and they are presented with an offer, let's say, 50% off your course if they sign up by Saturday 6th at 9 AM. Now, person 2 then signs up for your freebie on Tuesday 2nd at 5 PM and they are presented with the exact same offer, 50% of your course, but they have until Sunday 7th at 5 PM to take advantage of that deal. And then, person 3 signs up for your freebie on Wednesday 3rd at 11 PM. And again, they are presented with the exact same offer, 50% of your course, but person 3 has until Monday 8th at 11 PM to take advantage of the deal. In other words, no matter when a person arrives in your sales funnel, they will be presented with the exact same offer and have the exact same amount of time to take advantage of the offer.

Eb Gargano [00:21:27]:
Once the deadline has passed and the countdown timer hits 0, they will no longer be able to access the discount, and they will only have the option to pay full price for your digital product. It's kind of like each new subscriber entering your sales funnel has their own personalized flash sale. But why build an evergreen sales funnel? Well, the short answer is because they work. They enable you to sell a lot more products and earn a lot more money, and yet they enable you to work a lot less because once you've set one up, it runs entirely on autopilot. Who wouldn't want that? And the reason why evergreen sales funnels work so much better than regular flash sales is because they're only available to new subscribers. Every new subscriber who joins your list by signing up for one of your lead magnets is offered a limited time discount on your product. If they don't take you up on your offer within the limited time window, your product is then only available to them at full price. People soon learn that when you offer a discount, it really is only available for the short time period you specify.

Eb Gargano [00:22:39]:
And so that real sense of urgency is reinforced and they are much more likely to buy. Okay. So I know the title of this presentation is how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. But it would be remiss of me not to talk about what to do after you have built your product ladder and your evergreen sales funnel. Once that is all built, you then have what I call a sales system that is almost completely passive. And if you are already getting good traffic volumes, that system should help you 10 x your RPM and so 10 x your blogging income. But what then? Well, then you can turn your attention to getting even more traffic to the top of your funnel and further increasing your digital product income. And because of the nature of digital products, your focus is much less on the quantity of traffic and much more on the quality of traffic.

Eb Gargano [00:23:39]:
Or in other words, a 100 highly targeted perfect customers are worth far more to you than a 100000 Google traffic randoms. And this means you need a whole lot less traffic to make a digital product business viable, which in turn makes you a whole lot less dependent on Google for your traffic. And because you don't need those crazy high traffic volumes that only Google can bring, it opens up lots of other traffic sources. For example, Pinterest traffic, social media traffic, podcasts, summits, bundles, webinars, collaborations, guest posting, even paid ads. None of these traffic sources work very well when you monetize via ads and affiliates because they just don't send the kind of high traffic volumes you need to make ads and affiliates pay. But if you monetize by digital products which have a much higher RPM, these alternative traffic sources can work really, really well, often even better than Google. Okay. Something I'm hearing a lot at the moment is, I'm doing okay at the moment.

Eb Gargano [00:24:50]:
I'll worry about all of this in the future if and when my Google traffic goes south. But here's the thing. Building a successful digital product based business is not something you can turn on overnight. It actually takes quite a long time. Depending on where you are now, how much traffic you get, how strong your email list is, how engaged your audience is, it can take 6 months to a year. If you get hit by the next Google algorithm update, do you really want to wait a whole year before you are earning money from your blog again? And also, if you move right now, you'll be moving before most other bloggers. And so if and when there's some almighty shock in the future, the next Google update, changes to third party cookies, new developments in AI, etcetera, etcetera, you'll be established when other bloggers start flooding into the market which will give you a massive competitive advantage. Okay.

Eb Gargano [00:25:50]:
So I appreciate I have very much skimmed the surface here. I try to give you as much value as I can but there's just a limit to what I can give you in a 30 minute presentation. The truth is there are a lot of moving parts to building a successful digital product based business and unless you do them all, you are very unlikely to get anywhere near that 10 x figure. But if you've been inspired by this presentation and you want to 10 x your blogging income by diversifying into digital products, if you want to stop worrying about Google updates, and if you want to build a more sustainable and less precarious business that is built on assets you own rather than borrowed traffic and third party algorithms, I have just the thing to help you succeed, the digital product starter kit.
