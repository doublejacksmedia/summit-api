Chelsea Clarke [00:00:12]:
Wow, guys. It's the 2025 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I can't believe it. Thank you so much for joining me here in this session, and a big thank you to Liz for putting together this event year after year. Love it so much, and I'm so grateful to get to be a part of it. Everyone here watching, welcome. Thank you for attending this session here. It's gonna be a little bit different than other virtual summit sessions that I have presented on in the past.

Chelsea Clarke [00:00:40]:
This one is really a tough conversation, but it's so important that we have it. The title of my presentation is I Scaled Too Fast and I Nearly Destroyed My Business. Here's Everything That I'm Doing in 2025 to fix my mess. I'm putting my heart on my sleeve here to fess up to all of the f ups that I made over the past few years that really caused, not the best shift in my business. And I am sharing everything that I'm doing now to fix those mistakes and enter the new year with a better plan, better systems. And I really have some big things to share that I believe is worth saying because I know that it will help someone watching this session here. Whether you are a new blogger or you have been blogging for years years years, these things are going to come up. So I hope that you can learn from my mistakes and walk away from this with some practical advice you can utilize in your own business, from things that I have learned from.

Chelsea Clarke [00:01:48]:
And please stick around and watch until the end because I have some really cool bonuses to share with you that you just can't get anywhere else. So you need to stick around. I want this to be super actionable, so I won't spend much time on my introduction here. I'll keep it super short and sweet. My name is Chelsea Clarke. I've been a full time content creator since 2016. I've been blogging since way before that since like 20, 2006, 2007. I was on Tumblr.

Chelsea Clarke [00:02:18]:
Hey, Tumblr girlies. But I didn't monetize my site and operate my blog as a business until 2016. So I have as I say, I've been a full time creator since then, and my main website is herpaperroute.com. This is where I help content creators thrive in the creator economy. And it's interesting that we're having this conversation today because so many changes have happened over the past few years in the creator economy that it's extra, extra important that we touch on all of the things that have been going on all of the shifts and how we can stay strong to weather those storms when they happen and not give up on content creation. I also founded a platform called Niche Investor. This is a marketplace where content creators buy and sell websites and blogs, online businesses. And I also have a home renovation blog and YouTube channel where I'm sharing the journey of renovating my home with my husband.

Chelsea Clarke [00:03:13]:
Husband. We are funding the renovation with a 100% from funds that we make in the creator economy. So my husband is a content creator as well and a woodworker. Now that we got all that out of the way, let's dive in. So let's go back to 2020 when the pandemic hits. Just very briefly. I won't stick around in that horrible year for too long. But the thing is, for business, it was not horrible.

Chelsea Clarke [00:03:36]:
For business, especially in the creator economy, in the online business world, it was really good. Business was thriving in our industries. And this is partially because, well, more people were stuck at home. They were scrolling on their computers and phones. They had more time to start a business, to start a blog. There was a bigger audience. There was a captive audience. People were looking for other ways to get money because they maybe their hours got cut back or they lost their job in the pandemic.

Chelsea Clarke [00:04:07]:
So they were starting businesses. They were researching side hustles. They were learning how to get control of their revenue and financial future. And so in our industries, it was great. People were buying courses. People were buying all sorts of things. We were having virtual summits, and tons of people were turning out to those summits. And it was just a really captive time to have your message be heard, to connect with people, to make online business friends.

Chelsea Clarke [00:04:36]:
Everything just felt very, like, it was just all happening. And because everything was so high engagement and felt like everything was really going well, a lot of us thought that it was gonna stay like that forever, myself included. I really thought that I had figured out the ticket to life that business was always gonna be going this well. So having that mindset at the time, I was like, I guess I should be scaling up. I should be hiring people. I should be putting lots of money into ad spend. I could be getting a PR team. And I started thinking about all these things and how I could ramp up my business because what was working then, I my the logic was if I apply more effort and more money into that, then maybe we could double it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:05:20]:
Maybe we could triple it. And for the 1st year or so, yeah, that's what happened. That year, I made over $700,000, and I thought, well, it's just gonna be like this forever. Right? I think you kinda can guess where this is going. But here I had this money now to invest into my business. So what did I do? Well, everyone's saying, oh, you need to scale. You need to hire a coach who can get you to the next level. You need to invest in advertising, hire a team.

Chelsea Clarke [00:05:54]:
So in theory, these things are all good things. They can be when done right. But I did it too fast. My intuition was telling me when I thought about hiring a big team, my intuition was telling me probably can't afford it yet. Probably should probably slow down. But instead of listening to my intuition, I went ahead and I listened to social media. I listened to coaches. I listened to what people were suggesting you do when you get to that million mark, what you should be doing with your business.

Chelsea Clarke [00:06:24]:
Even though it didn't feel totally right to me. But I went ahead, and I hired a social media manager. I hired some content creators. I hired some writers. I hired hired a sales team, and I hired a PR team. And the job of the PR team was to get me mentioned in articles booked on podcasts and get some media appearances. And it was quite expensive to have them doing this. And I got a couple website mentions, and I got on a couple podcasts, but no big podcast and certainly no big media out of it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:07:01]:
It just wasn't worth it. And after I think it was about 6 months, almost almost a year, actually, I was like, this is not working. I'm hiring a lot of people, and it's pushing me beyond what feels comfortable for paying everyone. There's a bit of conversations going around the Internet. People say, you know, hire before you need the help. But I think that that's not the full story of what people need to consider. You shouldn't be hiring before you can afford to really pay everyone. And, which I mean is kind of obvious, But it's also why I didn't hire a team for so many years, and I did everything as a solopreneur because I wasn't sure if I could pay them.

Chelsea Clarke [00:07:40]:
And now because I'm seeing more money coming in, I'm thinking, oh, well, I guess I can afford them. So I'm hiring all these people even though it didn't feel quite right. We'll get back to that in a moment because I made another mistake around this exact time, and that was hiring a coach that was way too much money that just wasn't the right kind of value in return. Now the coach that I hired is a completely legitimate businessperson, and by no means am I disparaging her business in any way. I would never do that to another business owner, to another creator. She's absolutely legitimate, and I really do like her. But the coaching package wasn't for me personally, so it was a mistake for me. And hiring a coach can be a wonderful thing.

Chelsea Clarke [00:08:26]:
This is also not to disparage the coaching industry in any way. If you can connect with someone, really vibe with them, and you're really getting what you need and the payment structure feels right to you, then absolutely. That's a great coaching situation. It just wasn't that way for me. And, unfortunately, I had I moved forward, and I signed on to the coaching program because I had seen things online saying, oh, when you're at that million mark, you need to hire someone who could take you to the $10,000,000 mark. And she was someone who has hit that 1$0,000,000 mark in her business. So I thought who better than this person? And I gave her $50,000 to, you know, learn how she's running her business. And, unfortunately, that's just not what I got out of it.

Chelsea Clarke [00:09:09]:
And so that was a costly mistake for me. So the word of warning here is to really, really, really research anything that you sign up for, anything over $10,000, really, really, really, really be so careful with where you're spending your money. Because there are a lot of people that will just charge an exorbitant amount for their coaching program, like $20,000, $30,000, or $50,000 like I paid for. And you're just not necessarily guaranteed to get the type of support that you may need at the stage that you are at. And I had other coaches as well that I was paying for and and coaches that were not charging for their services, just, you know, mastermind style. This was a good thing. I was really being a sponge, and I I always wanna learn from different perspectives. So just being aware and listening to different people.

Chelsea Clarke [00:09:58]:
But my problem at this time was I was putting too much value into other people's, perspectives than my own. And instead of just taking what everyone, different coaches, and different business owners were recommending, and then internalizing that and thinking, okay. Well, what feels right to me? I just thought, okay. Well, these people are at, you know, 10 x where I'm at right now, so they must have all the answers. So I'm just gonna do exactly what they say, and that is a huge, huge mistake. So not only am I at this time hiring too many people that I'm not comfortable with being able to afford? But I'm also paying too much and listening too much to the perspectives of others even if it's going against what my intuition is telling me. So, again, this is gonna come that you're gonna see a theme now through this conversation. Listen to your intuition.

Chelsea Clarke [00:10:45]:
Your intuition knows what's up. Okay? So we that's that's what we need to do. We need to listen to what we're feeling in here and in here. And then also at this time, because scaling was my focus that that year, I'm thinking, where can I network more? Where can I do brand sponsorship where my brand is a sponsor and get in front of new audiences, which is a great thing to be thinking about? I just, again, did it too fast. I paid for hefty packages to be a brand sponsor at different events, to have a booth at different conferences. And, sure, I met some great people. It was a fun experience, and we got some brand recognition out. But the ROI, looking at the numbers, for me, it just wasn't worth it because I did too many too fast.

Chelsea Clarke [00:11:34]:
It really wasn't worth that ROI. I removed the personal touch of my business that my brand had been known and loved for. And really in this 2 year period, I was so removed from the business that it didn't feel like my own anymore, and I started to resent it, which is not cool. Not cool at all. My brand lost a little bit of its uniqueness during that time. So here we are. We're getting towards 2023 now, and I've got all of these big expenses going on. And sales started to go down.

Chelsea Clarke [00:12:07]:
It really started a noticeable change. There were less people turning up to workshops. There were less people signing up for things. There were less people enrolling in courses. It was a slow trickle, but it was noticeable. This is where it might get a little bit dark, but it's important to talk about because at some point, as business owners, you know, you might find yourself here or you already have been or you currently are, and you need to have a business recovery plan. I think I need to let some people go. I don't wanna do that.

Chelsea Clarke [00:12:40]:
This is the this is the part that was the toughest was to let people on my team go. What I did first was I cut my own salary. So before I could even take anyone off the team, I cut my own salary, and I ran the business for another 6 months seeing if maybe that would help. And I lowered some of my expenses that I could. So time is going on, and it's not really making a big enough cut. So I let the PR team go. I let the social media manager go. This is really, really, really tough.

Chelsea Clarke [00:13:12]:
I think all of us here watching, we really do care about the people that we work with, and we have a bond with them. It's not just you know, they're not just doing a job for you. You become friends with them. So it really, really sucks to have to let anyone on your team go. It would have been a lot easier if from the beginning I just didn't scale so fast, if I just didn't hire all these people so fast. Because having to fire later, sucks. It just sucks. I'm running my company with just a small team, but sales are just not where they need to be to be able to support the number of people that I have on my team.

Chelsea Clarke [00:13:50]:
Now I have stopped going to conferences. I have stopped sponsoring conferences. I have cut back my advertising spend, and I'm no longer working with the expensive coaches. So you would think that everything's gonna be fine. And I'm thinking, okay. Things are gonna pick up. Well, then the, helpful content update hits in Google, and it knocks out a ton of websites. And in my industry, we help website owners grow and monetize and sell their their sites.

Chelsea Clarke [00:14:21]:
So this was a really big shock to a lot of people. What it did was it slowed down the amount of people who were buying sites. It also slowed down the amount of people that were selling as well. I cut my own salary down lower because I didn't wanna fire anyone. I was reluctant to make any cuts for a very long time because I was hopeful that this was just gonna be a temporary thing. Sales in general, were going to bounce back. Every time that I had to sit down and do payroll, I would have a panic attack because I'm having to pay my team now not out of business earnings, but I'm having to pull out of business savings just to cover things, just to get through the month. And then in early 2024, I attended a retreat, And, honestly, I would not have gone on this retreat if the tickets had been refundable, but they weren't.

Chelsea Clarke [00:15:13]:
And I had purchased them almost a year before, when things were going well. So I had to go on this trip, and I am thankful that I did because the presentations at this retreat were really, really helpful. Every person there was sharing the same sentiment that business is tough right now. And this is not to be all doom and gloom. We're gonna we're gonna turn this around in a minute, but it is important that we talk about this. So when I'm at the retreat, which is a retreat for 6, 7, 8, 9 figure business owners, I was feeling like, why am I here? When I joined this group, I felt like I was up here with everybody, and now I'm, like, way down here. What am I even doing here? But listening to the presentations, by the end of the retreat, I realized we were all on the same boat. Everyone was saying it's been the tough tough year toughest year ever, with the changes in Google and just general after pandemic recession issues.

Chelsea Clarke [00:16:12]:
And so all of these people have had to make major cuts in their business. And, 2 people in their presentations were saying how they felt so pulled away from their business because when things were good, they had hired tons of people, to take care of everything, and they were no longer as involved in the business. And that's exactly how I had been feeling. Like, I my personal touch just wasn't there, which then resulted in me just kind of resenting my own business. Then in the conversations, it came up about letting people go on your team, having to make those cuts. And the sentiment seemed to be universal that everyone expressed how horrible it is to have to do that. But as soon as you do it, you get a sense of relief. And, you know, don't wait too long to let people go when you know what's the right thing to do even though it feels horrible and you don't wanna upset anyone.

Chelsea Clarke [00:17:08]:
If it needs to be done for your business, you need to do it. This part of my presentation here, it's like we need to scale back. We scale too fast. We need to go back to our roots. And you might not be feeling this, but this is exactly where I was at in the last year. I needed to get more involved in my business. I really missed the day to day. I missed content creation.

Chelsea Clarke [00:17:31]:
I love that. I love creating blog posts, and it had been so long since I had actually been able to create a blog post in my business. I had all of these other people doing this for my business. It just I didn't it didn't feel like mine anymore. So when I boarded the plane and I headed back home after that trip, I knew what I had to do. And so I made the very tough decision to let everyone on my team go except one key team member and the people in my family who work in the business. And for as hard as that was, when the next payday came around, there was no panic attack this time. I actually felt empowered.

Chelsea Clarke [00:18:08]:
I felt so good. And just knowing that there was an abundance of being able to pay everyone, and I you know, that stress was just removed from me. Moving into the new month, I now felt great. Like, I had this weight lifted off of me that now creativity was flowing in, and I was getting back into the grassroots of my business. I felt a full new just revived sense of I can do this. I wanna create. And so I just started writing like crazy and pinning, creating pins, and focusing on just creating new blog content. And it felt so good.

Chelsea Clarke [00:18:47]:
This is what I was doing back when I started my business, and I had taken so many steps to pull myself away from the content creation side of my business that it it got to a point where I wasn't really content creating in my content creator business. And now I was back and I was doing it and it felt so, so right. So we're not done just yet, but I do wanna do this quick little overview. Hiring mistakes, I hired too fast. Too many people more than I can afford. People were saying you need to scale. You need to hire. You need everyone taking care of everything on your list and in your business.

Chelsea Clarke [00:19:19]:
And that is not true. That's not a 100% true. It might be for some people, but you don't have to hire out and outsource so much that it no longer feels like your business. At least in my case, that's what I learned. And because of industry shifts, like the Google algorithm affecting websites, affecting the resale market, and affecting content creation, content creators' ad revenue and just everything. It's it's all comes together. Very, very, very important that you have multiple traffic sources on your website, multiple revenue streams on your website. Another mistake that I made personally was hiring coaches too fast and paying too much for coaching services when that wasn't really what I needed at the stage I was at.

Chelsea Clarke [00:20:05]:
I was listening to the voices circulating around on the Internet saying, when you, you know, when you hit a million, you need to hire a coach who can take you to 10,000,000, 20,000,000. And for many cases, that can be very helpful, but it was against my intuition because it didn't feel quite right to me. It wasn't the right match for me with coat with the coaches that I hired. And because the industry was changing so much at that time, it just wasn't the right situation for me to have those coaches. So listening to others over my own intuition and over your own intuition, that is a huge, huge thing. Always check-in with yourself. Before making any big changes in your business and in your blog. Sit back and really just reflect on it and see how it feels.

Chelsea Clarke [00:20:50]:
How how does it feel to you and your body? You're gonna get the right answer. Another mistake that I made was hiring costly PR and sponsorships. Investing into sponsoring, in person events wasn't really a necessity for me. I spent too much doing that. I should have gone slower. I should have just done one, tested the ROI, and maybe done another one a year later instead of trying to do a whole bunch in 1 year. For me personally, it just wasn't the right next step. And also hiring that PR team, the ROI just wasn't there.

Chelsea Clarke [00:21:27]:
So here is what I am doing now in 2025 to fix this mess that I created for myself since the pandemic. And, hopefully, these tips will be really helpful to you moving forward. And, hopefully, this is very practical advice that you can take and walk away from today and apply to your business. So the first step is I am using a vision board to map out my goals for the year, exactly the things that I want to do, and exactly the vision that I have for my brand. And I'm going back to my grassroots, and I'm looking at what I was thinking when I started the business. I'm starting there and focusing on what I can do moving forward that still has those same values. The hack for creating a vision board that really, really works is anything that you write on it, write it in the past tense. So let's say you want to get 10,000 page views a month with your blog in the 1st part of the year.

Chelsea Clarke [00:22:29]:
So instead of writing on your vision board, I want to get 10,000 page views a month. Instead of writing that, you're gonna write, I got 10,000 page views a month in February, in March, whatever it is. You're putting a date on it, and you're writing it in the past tense as if it has already happened. Write it out on a Post it or wherever you keep your vision board, put it up on your wall, or if you have a digital vision board, I use both. Read it out loud because when you're reading it out loud, you are telling your brain and your subconscious that you mean business, and you're tricking your brain into thinking it's already happened. And therefore, you are manifesting it to happen and drawing in that energy so that it really does come to life and happen. I am focusing on content creation and me being the one who creates that content in my business. I am blogging as in publishing new content every day or every second day.

Chelsea Clarke [00:23:21]:
I get up early and I just create new blog content. It's so funny because we all started our blogs. We all entered and became a entered the blogging industry, became a blogger, and pretty soon, a lot of us found that we no longer do blogging. Like, the thing that we do the least in our business is blogging because we're so busy with marketing, with sales, with product creation, and all of that stuff is important. But let's remember to get back to blogging and focus on blogging as the foundation of our business because that's where all the money really comes from. The more content that we're putting out means the more traffic. The more content we're putting on Pinterest, to direct traffic to that blog post, that's uplifting our brand, bringing in more traffic, more revenue. We're getting ads on our sites.

Chelsea Clarke [00:24:07]:
Everything comes back to the content on our blog. More content equals more money. That's just how it is, so we need to focus on blogging. And, also, it's the funnest part of the business too is being able to create content. We love that. The next most important action step that I'm taking into 2025, and I think that will be very beneficial to other creators here listening, is Pinterest. Pinterest, putting in the love and attention that Pinterest needs. Now I have been pinning about 5 to 20 pins a day for the past few months, to my home decor site, and it's now getting over 4,000,000, monthly page views, which is generating 40,000 page views just from Pinterest.

Chelsea Clarke [00:24:47]:
And this is to a website that I only started creating content on, in this last summer. Pinterest, it fluctuates. It definitely fluctuates seasonal, and I do have a lot of seasonal content on that, on that blog. But it's a good first start, and it is a result of showing up, creating content on Pinterest, creating new blog posts on my website, and using Pinterest to promote them. That's a big focus for me this year moving forward. I think that investing time into Pinterest a 100% is worth it. Not for every niche, but I think that if you have a niche that, is popular on Pinterest, if the things trend on Pinterest in your niche, then you really should be utilizing Pinterest for your blog. Collaboration with other creators.

Chelsea Clarke [00:25:35]:
Collaboration is one of the biggest things you can do for your business, and this is an example right here what you're watching. I've collaborated with Liz to get to create content for her Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Being in a virtual summit is one of my favorite ways to collaborate with other creators. So if you are a content creator, which I'm guessing you are, if you are here at this summit, think about what type of virtual events happen in your niche. Get out there, make friends, let those hosts of those summits know that you would love to be able to present something at their summit. Maybe you're gonna start your own virtual summit this year in your niche. You know, do it. Business bundles, that's another way when you can collaborate with a group of other creators in your niche.

Chelsea Clarke [00:26:19]:
That's always a great focus for growing your business organically. The next thing that I am focusing on is simplifying what it means to be a creator, what it means to be a CEO. I have embraced my own style of being a CEO, and I have learned through my own mistakes over the past few years that I don't want to lead a huge team. I don't wanna have a massive global company with 1,000 and 1,000 of employees. I actually really love being a solopreneur or a semi solopreneur with a very small team. That is where I am fueled the best. I'm the happiest. I work the best.

Chelsea Clarke [00:26:59]:
It just feels right for me. So embracing that that is okay and not only okay, but wonderful to just be a small creator and a small business owner. I am shedding the identity of what I thought being a CEO was supposed to look like and be like, and I've come to accept that. I've come to the realization that not only is it okay to scale back, but it's actually what I need in order to be happy as an entrepreneur. Scaling back has been a very good thing for me. I don't like managing a team of multiple people. I don't like having tons of people in my head telling me different things, different ways to do business. I actually really love doing things my way.

Chelsea Clarke [00:27:50]:
I thrive, quiet reflection time. I really just came to that realization that operating that heart centered business that serves my community is the most important thing, and it's what drives the revenue in the business and what keeps the business going. And being okay with slow growth. Slow but steady growth is fantastic. Who are these people that are telling us we need to scale up super fast and hit 1,000,000 and 1,000,000 of dollars in revenue if it doesn't feel right to us. And this is the probably the biggest takeaway of this presentation is listening to your own intuition, letting your intuition guide you in your business. That is going to be the strongest asset in your business, and that is how you're you are going to be successful is listening to your heart. What does it want you to do? What is the next step? You already know.

Chelsea Clarke [00:28:48]:
You just have to listen to yourself. So building an intuition led business and listening to your gut, you will be successful. And by no means do I mean don't listen to other people. Always consider other perspectives. Be a sponge in the online world. Listen to podcasts, read books, educate yourself, hear what other people have gone through, and especially being a part of a virtual summit like this. Watch every single summit presentation here. Liz curates the best people in the industry at all different types of, niches, different stages in their business.

Chelsea Clarke [00:29:30]:
They've got marketing pros, blogging pros, digital product creator pros. Watch everything. Watch the replays. Make time to literally sit down and watch everything and listen because every little bit of information is coming into your subconscious, and it's teaching you. You're educating yourself. But really think about what that information feels like and know that what works for one person doesn't mean it's gonna work for everyone. Being able to listen to all of these different people give their guidance, their ideas, and their advice is a wonderful piece of information. It's worth its weight in gold.

Chelsea Clarke [00:30:06]:
Take it all in, but then reflect on everything before making any decisions to see what feels right for you. And that is my key message of this presentation is to listen to your intuition, scale slowly, and let go of the pressure to grow your business faster than what feels right. So we have some bonuses and resources to share with you now, and I wanna say thank you so much for sticking around and watching this presentation. First of all, Liz has put together an incredible speaker bonus bundle. And my bonus that you will get access to if you upgrade to the speaker bundle bonus is you will get 3 months free access to my membership, the creator society. Now the creator society is where you can work with me 1 on 1. We have a live monthly virtual call where a small group of us discuss blogging, growing a blog, growing a business in the creator economy. We talk about tuning into your intuition and leading your business the way that feels right to you.

Chelsea Clarke [00:31:10]:
So it's both practical strategy that we talk about step by step processes for building a business and marketing and growing and content creation and lead funnels and all that kind of technical stuff, as well as the emotional side of running a business, making decisions that feel right on our own terms. And the coolest part about it is you get to meet other creators, people who have felt the same way you are. You get to learn from them. You get to share your ideas. You get to help others in the group. It's a really cool, friendly, supportive community. And as a member of the creator society at Her Paper Route, you get access to all of my digital programs. You will get access to my sales funnel course, which teaches you how to build a sales funnel around your blog.
