Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
All right, guys, thank you so much for joining me for this session with Amber Lozzi. I'm super pumped to have her. Amber, welcome.

Amber Lozzi [00:00:06]:
Thank you. Excited to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah, because I think I first came across you a few years ago. You had something in like the James Flyers toolkit and it just made me think about things differently. And so I'm really excited you agreed to be part of the summit. For those of you that don't know, she's the founder of Amberlozemarketing and Thriftyguardian.com, can you tell us what we're going to be covering today? I know we're talking about marketing.

Amber Lozzi [00:00:33]:
Absolutely. Well, as you mentioned, my course automation education was actually the course that was included in the Genius Bloggers toolkit a couple of years ago. And one of my key to successes, I would say, is the fact that I'm able to implement automated marketing in such a way that we don't sever that connection with our audience. Right. And so, while I cover a whole lot of steps to automated marketing within my course, today we're going to be talking about the five key steps that I have found to automated marketing made simple. And again, to automated marketing that is done in such a way to where your audience still feels that genuine, authentic connection that is key to making sales.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:17]:
Yeah, because there's a lot of marketing automation you could do, but it's just.

Amber Lozzi [00:01:22]:
Like set it and forget it and.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:
Then you're not connecting with people. But marketing is so important to successful blog and business. So I'm really excited.

Amber Lozzi [00:01:30]:
Me too. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:31]:
All right, so let's go ahead. I'm going to let you take over and I'm excited to learn from you.

Amber Lozzi [00:01:36]:
And take some notes. All right, everyone, let's go ahead and jump right in. Again, this is automated marketing made simple. With yours truly, Amber Tamari Lozzi. Now, if you are new to who exactly I am, what it is I've got going on, I want to start off by telling you that I've been on this adventure for nearly 20 years. So back in the days of MySpace and GeoCities and yes, even good old Neopets, I was there learning HTML, learning coding and learning about blogging. Back when it was web blogging. I don't know if anybody even has heard that term. I guarantee you if I said that to a 20 year old, they'd go, how? What? Now? It was a lifestyle, it was a journal of sorts and clearly it has evolved far beyond what it used to be, but that was and still is to this day a big part of my life. And I always say that as a sort of caveat to introducing my story because when people hear about my success, they often think, oh, I want to do it that quickly. I want to make that happen as soon as she did. And so I always want to remind them that, again, this is something I've been building towards since I was a kid. Now, before I launched my first for profit blog, I used to work at a local community college teaching organizational leadership, marketing. I worked very closely with a lot of the student clubs and organizations to help them learn how best to market not only their clubs, but themselves as they transitioned into either a four year university or transitioned out into what we call the real world. Now, as much as I loved my students, I did not love the politics that come with working in higher ed. It just wasn't for me. And so when I was passed over for a much deserved, much looked forward to promotion despite having put in 50 60 hours a week and was there despite having to take care of my kids and be a full time mom nearly while also being this full time employee working towards again what I thought was going to be the job of my dreams. I said I'm done. I can't do it. And now again, I've got two kids, I've got a little boy who is six and then a little girl who will soon be five. And together we are all kind of kooky, quacky, wild, crazy, but it's life, and it's life that I love. And so when I was passed over for this promotion, I really, to be honest, was devastated. I thought, what am I going to do with my life? I was barely bringing home two and a half dollars because I was paying for daycare and all that good stuff. And yet again, I was putting in all of these extra hours at work and I just felt like I was drowning and I couldn't do it anymore. And so my husband, who you see pictured there, had been talking for two years about launching his own blog, about becoming the next Pat Flynn, the next Mr. Money Mustache. And I said, yeah, let's do that. Like, yes, please. And just talked and talked and talked and talked. Right. We've all been there. You get analysis paralysis or you get stuck in the thousands of to dos that come with launching a blog. And so in November of 2015, I launched Thrifty Guardian, which again was my first for profit blog. I didn't expect to make a lot of money from it. I didn't expect to ever be able to quit my job with it. It was just something again, to share my story, to bring back a hobby that I loved. I'm sure if you are a parent, you've had that time in your life where you maybe kind of questioned your identity or sort of lost yourself. And so at the time, my kids were both under two years old and one of them was obviously still nursing. And so I was really just looking for something fun, a fun outlet. And so I launched Thrifty guardian to share my budgeting expertise, to share my frugal living tips, my money making tips, hoping to just make enough to where I'd be able to feel better about leaving my kids crying at daycare every morning, about being having to work weekends sometimes, about being out of the house 12 hours a day. I thought maybe if I have this, it'll help me feel better. At least I'll be able to contribute a little bit more. Maybe we'll be able to hire a housekeeper so I don't have to spend so much time cleaning and just trying to find little ways to fit it in to where I no longer lived for just the weekends. Well, since then, it has transformed into where I run two sites. Now, of course I run Amberlozzi.com, which is the my services site through which I share my digital marketing expertise. And then of course, I still run Thriftyguardian to this day because guess what? Launched in November of 2015. By April of 2016, I gave my two weeks notice and I was done. And I walked away from my career in higher ed, the career that I thought I would have for my entire life. I did it all thanks to Thrifty Guardian, all thanks to blogging, and all thanks to smart marketing strategies that were implemented to save me time, but that were still effective. And so, again, that's what we're going to talk about today, is really implementing marketing strategies and building that strong foundation for automated marketing so that you see success quickly, but without that sacrifice that one might often mistakenly make by setting up these strategies inappropriately or not being strategic about how they do that. So these are my top tips. Tip number one. And this is something where if you've ever watched one of my videos, if you've ever worked with me, if you've ever pretty much heard words come out of my mouth, the first thing that I say when it comes to finding success marketing your blog is to always have an editorial calendar. And I say this even for my clients that aren't bloggers, it makes for an exceptionally amazing marketing tool. And so when you are looking at building that editorial calendar, you will consider the seasons, you'll consider what's going on, when obviously you want to identify your target market and think about their own personal timelines. If you're in the health and fitness industry, for example, then obviously January is going to be a big boom for you as people talk about their New Year's resolutions and wanting to live healthy. Or if you target moms, then right after the back to school craziness, that's when they're really able to sit down and take a breath and focus on whatever it might be reading your blog, or maybe signing up for your email list or even buying from you, ideally, right? Or clicking through those affiliate links. You need to think about the timeline. And so that is why my own personal opt in for my website is an editorial calendar tutorial, because it is essential. It is a game changer. If you've never used an editorial calendar before, now's the time to really sit down. Because I promise you that if you can be consistent with what it is you're putting out there, that's going to make all the difference in the kind of connection that you have with your audience, in terms of what they can expect from you, in terms of what they learn from you. All of that good stuff. You really want that consistency. You need that consistency if you're going to find success. Not only that, the tying us back to automated marketing, you have to know what you're building from, you have to know what you're springboarding from, right? You have to know what you're going to be talking about, when and we're going to touch a little bit more on that here in a second. But if you don't have a plan in place for what kind of content you're putting out with your blog, you're not going to be able to have a successful plan in place for automated marketing, for marketing it at all. You're not going to know what emails you want to be sending when, what you want to be putting out on your Facebook or what sort of images you might be wanting to put on Instagram. If you're using Pinterest, which as a blogger you should be, you need to have it in advance. You need to have that editorial calendar because you need to get pins out there two to three months in advance. Right now we're looking coming into February. If you are only just now writing a blog post about Valentine's Day and it's your first blog post about Valentine's Day and you're just now getting it out there, I'm sorry to tell you, but chances are good it's not going to pick up traction. That's not to say that next year it won't, but this year too little too late. So you need to be willing to plan ahead and again, that comes by having an editorial calendar next. You need to know when your money makers are, right? I said we were just going to touch on that a moment ago. You need to know what you are going to be pushing and when. And so like we talked about the editorial calendar in terms of the content you're pushing, this also comes into play again going back to, let's say you're in the health and fitness industry, right, and you've got an amazing affiliate partnership with Healthy Wage, which is a website that pays you to lose weight. If you know that people are going to be coming to your site looking for tips and tricks and ideas and blog posts about losing weight and motivation to stay on track and how do they stick to their New Year's resolution, you know that you're going to be wanting to push that affiliate link for Healthy Wage. You know that that is when you're going to be on point. That is when you need to maybe add a sidebar ad or make sure that your links are up to date or put it out on Facebook that they're running a special where now instead of a $50 incentive, it's $100 incentive. But again, if you're scrambling at the last minute, all of a sudden it's January 10 and you go, oh, why am I not pushing healthy wage right now? You've lost possibly hundreds, if not thousands of dollars that comes from not having that plan in place. Just like, let's say you are planning to launch your first e course three months from now, you should already be drafting out your marketing plans. Now you should already be thinking about what that's going to look like. A big part of my success early on and even now to this day is my e courses. I have automation education, which is a full course far, far deeper than this. 30 minutes training is on automated marketing and how to use the individual platforms. I have Pinterestential planning, which is my favorite course. If I'm going to pick favorites, play favorites on Pinterest and making the most of that, I've got clients who are seeing 15 plus million monthly views on Pinterest in due part to what they learned in that course. But I can tell you again, if I just threw it out there one day and said, hey guys, my cart's open. I've got this awesome new e course going on. Even if my copy is on point, even if you've been doing a decent job nurturing your email list kind of sorta, and you've been kind of hinting that something's coming up, you could have the most persuasive copy out there. But if you are just all of a sudden flying by the seat of your pants trying to launch this course, no marketing in place, just been really inconsistent with what you're putting out there, you're going to fall on your face and I certainly don't want that for you and you certainly don't want that for yourself. So you've got to know what it is you are going to be making money from and when. And I'm not kidding when I say that a couple of months ago as we were wrapping up 2019, I sat down for the entire year, right? I didn't do an editorial calendar for the entire year. That would probably make even me pull my brain and pull my hair out. But I sat down and noted what I was going to be promoting every single month. And if there was more than one thing that month, making sure that there wasn't any significant overlap, making sure I wasn't going to be pushing too much, you need to sit down and really just start drafting that out. And if you're new to blogging, right, you're sitting here going, amber, I haven't even made $10 for my blog. How am I supposed to know when my money makers are, you'll learn and you can most definitely set yourself some goals, get those ideas flowing. Think about your affiliate partnerships. Think about what digital products you might be wanting to put out there. Think about what your sales funnel might look like as they progress through that welcome series. You've got it set up for your email. Even if you haven't yet made much money or any money at all with your blog, you still know ideally, because you are so close to that blog, to that topic, what you're going to want to push when and again. This is something that can certainly grow and change, right? It's a living document. It's not something set in stone. But if you've got an idea as to what you're going to be pushing when, what kind of money you want to be making, when and how that again allows you that space to see when you're maybe going to be doing more nurture work, when you maybe need to step back and stop because you've been pushing sales. Sales. It really makes a big difference again, in the marketing strategy that you're going to be building, especially in terms of automated marketing, in terms of getting ahead with your scheduling again, both with your blog posts themselves, but with the content you're putting out on all of social media, on Pinterest, whatever the case may be. Next is to find a system that works for you, right? So it could be something as simple as an Excel sheet, right? Maybe you run an XML sitemap, pull all of your blog post links and just get them in a sheet. You can see there on my tabs, I've got all my blog posts and this is early on, okay, so this is more for you beginner bloggers, or maybe if you're neurotic like me a little, type A. This is what I used and I had all my blog posts listed. You can see down there, I had my referral links. This is back before I was really big into affiliate marketing. I didn't even know what affiliate marketing was. And so I just put referral links again very early on here. I kept note of my features. So if I was on a podcast or in an interview or did a guest post, made note of all of that. So that should someone want or should I decide to build a featured page on my blog, I don't have to go hunting all of that down. Just like if you have an affiliate link tab, if you're in a Facebook group that allows you to post affiliate links, like, let's say somebody asks a question about your favorite scheduling software, if you've got this in your Google Drive or your Dropbox can immediately open that document, grab your affiliate link, and post it in the comments. You don't have to go hunting for it. You don't have to try and jump on real quick and log in to share a sale or whatever the case may be. Rakuten. All those affiliate platforms, you just pull it. I've also got a Facebook group schedule, and that was when I was doing more of the day to day promoting within different Facebook groups that allowed it. So boost your blog. I might still be in. Honestly, I did promotion in my own groups. I run Pinterest Pals, and I used to have another entrepreneurial blogging group I'm even in. My favorite Facebook group, for example, is Boss Moms, which doesn't allow direct promotion. But again, back in the day, just having that reminder of what groups to check in on, I don't know, if you've been around long enough, you might remember Melissa Griffin's group. That was again, one of my favorites before she closed that down. And so it was just having those links there to where I could click through and not get distracted with the home feed. You don't get distracted with scrolling through and a picture of an otter. You can just click right into the group, focus in on engaging. Again, if the group allows it, you can promote yourself, whatever the case may be, but it keeps you very focused. And then I also have a tab there for hex codes because again, even now I do almost all of my own graphic design. But being able to pull those right colors right away, not having to do like a color dropper, try to figure it out or try to remember it from memory, that'll never happen again. I can just pull that document up and it's right there for you. And then of course, I had my Facebook business page. This was before scheduling was a thing in Facebook, so I used Hootsuite, and at one point I was using Buffer. But I would line it, lay it out, so that I knew again what I was pushing when. So that I wasn't trying to share two affiliate links in one week, or I wasn't just sharing blog post after blog post. Amount of content, making sure that you have a consistent but well placed schedule. Really, again, it makes such a big difference, not only because of what it is that you're putting out in front of your audience, but what it is that you're putting out via Facebook that keeps that algorithm happy, right? And then, of course, TG Facebook and LW Facebook. Those were for my separate Facebook pages that I was running. So if you are running more than one, really taking the time to map out the content for both is key to seeing success. Maybe the spreadsheet doesn't work for you, then maybe jump on Trello. I personally am not a huge fan of Trello, but maybe it works for you. That's something that I always stress when I'm doing trainings on automated marketing and talking about my own stories and sharing my own behind the scenes work. Just because I'm sitting here telling you, here's how I got from A to C. Here's how I found success. Here's my step by step. It doesn't matter, because if it doesn't work for you, if you're not comfortable with it, if you find it tedious or boring or overwhelming or whatever the case may be, you're going to stop using it, right? So even though I personally am not a big fan of Trello, I've got clients who love it, and so I accommodate them. I will make that work. And so try that out. Maybe that's something just like I talk about going back to Editorial calendars, maybe pen and paper isn't your thing. Maybe sitting out and writing out an actual calendar, you're like, no. Well, there's tons of different options in terms of software. There's a plugin literally called Editorial Calendar that is on WordPress. There's tons of different options out there. If you go into Google and type Editorial Calendar software, editorial Calendar plugin, you'll find a bunch of different options. But for me, again, coming back to what I do, I love pen and paper. There's definitely something to be said for the psychology of putting pen to paper in terms of memory mapping and all of that. Again, I'm old school. I've been doing this for so long. That's what I love. That's what I enjoy. I'm a writer by trade. I love pen to paper. It really helps me remember what it is I'm doing. But from there, again, I do plug it into my computer, whether that's scheduling out content or putting up a blog post or whatever the case may be, right? We live in this online community of bloggers, so eventually it does get on there. But again, it really is something where you might have to try one or two things to see what works best for you. But if you keep moving forward, if you keep trying and adjusting, when you feel something's working or when something's not, you'll see growth, you'll see success, and you'll be able to schedule out all the further with your automated marketing strategies. And then tip number four is please don't try to be everywhere at once, okay? And what I mean by that is that when you're thinking about your marketing strategy, you don't want to be thinking about what it is you're going to put on Facebook. And what it is you're going to put on. Twitter and what it is you're going to put on Instagram and what it is you're going to put on LinkedIn and Pinterest and maybe you're even trying to get on Snapchat and TikTok and, you know, everywhere you're gonna burn out. Most bloggers quit within the first three months of trying to find success because, well, I mean, I guess there's a lot of reasons, but part of it is because they want to be everywhere once, right? And they burn out. They think that they've got to be on all of these different platforms so that they're seen so that their content is seen, and that's not the case. Be strategic. Be where your target market is. For me, again, I love Facebook groups. That's where I first started networking as a blogger. That's still where I love to hang out now. It's where I find some of my clients and it's where I make, you know, my online friends. It's where I just, you know, get to know other bloggers and other colleagues. But for you, maybe you really like being on Twitter, or maybe you are more of a professional. Maybe you're sharing career building tips on your blog. Then maybe being on LinkedIn does make more sense for you. But if you're trying to be on ten different platforms all at once, I don't care if you are using Meet Edgar as your scheduling software, you're going to burn out. You're going to get tired. Your audience, especially if you're just copying and pasting and not really doing much in terms of repurposing your content, your audience is going to get burnt out. The algorithms are going to get burnt out. You're not going to see any sort of results. And again, I don't want that for you. I am here because I want you to be successful. I want you to live the life of your dreams and find your freedom through your blog, just as I did. So I'm not trying to just shout into the wind here. Trust me when I say that wherever you are at in this blogging journey of yours, I am here to celebrate you and I am here to cheer you on as you find your success. But you can't find it by throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks. You can't find success through automated marketing or otherwise. If you are again trying to be on all of these different social media platforms and you're not consistent with what it is you're doing, you're not engaging with the people who actually do comment and like and share your stuff or you miss things, right? If you are scheduling stuff out, let's say you sit down and you schedule stuff out for the week and you've got it going out on all the different major social media platforms, and you're feeling good and you're like, oh, I'm doing what Amber told me. I am ahead of the game. Yay. And then you forget about it, right? You forget to check Twitter, and all of a sudden something of yours starts to blow up. And then it fizzles out because you forgot to open Twitter for three days because it's not a big deal to you, because it's not something you personally like to use. Wouldn't you be heartbroken? Like, I'm heartbroken for you just thinking about that. So please focus in on where your readers are and focus in on getting that platform with automated marketing strategies. Focus in on getting tactics in place for that platform and then branch out from there. I'm not saying you can't be using Twitter and LinkedIn and Instagram. If right now your audience is on Facebook, focus on Facebook first and then the rest will follow as they need to. That along those lines. Absolutely. I 1000% recommend that you schedule your posts in one sitting, and that goes for any platform, regardless. Maybe you're already doing really good with Facebook. You want to keep that rolling, but now you want to try Instagram. It's going to be a lot at first, right, as you're starting to think about going back to your editorial calendar and thinking about, okay, what sales am I going to be pushing? When are my money makers? And you're thinking about what sort of software you want to use. Doesn't matter what software you use, you have to sit down and actually use it. I personally like to do it on Sundays, right? Even now, here we are, four years into me being this work from home blogger and doing what I do. I still do work most weekends because I'm heavily involved in my kids schools. I do volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity and a couple of other local organizations. I like to live my best life, and that includes sometimes working weekends. And I love that I'm okay with that. And so for me, I sit down on Sundays and I look at what it is I've got coming up for the week, what it is I want to be pushing. Maybe it is a nurture sequence or maybe it is a sales sequence. And then you can either write out all of the copy at once going back to that Excel sheet, if you've got different images that you're going to be using, writing out those captions. Or personally I really like later for Instagram, especially because it's free, which is always nice. And I use Facebook schedule, of course, my schedule within Facebook. Facebook likes that we want to keep Facebook happy. And then I use tailwind for pinterest. And so I sit down and I schedule all of that out. And sometimes, depending on what's going on, it might take me 2 hours. But then I only have to spend ten minutes a day checking in on my posts and engaging with those who are engaging with me. Right? That's the end game is to get you to a place where, yes, you might have to batch out your work, and yes, at first you might be spending five, 6 hours, which at first seems overwhelming, right? But then you get that out of the way. And now the rest of the week can be a cake clock. The rest of the week you can just maybe while you're drinking your morning coffee, pop on Facebook real quick, see what's going on, engage with people, have encourage shares, or maybe you've got groups you can share in or even you're at lunch, maybe you're still working a nine to five, got a lunch break, great. Jump on your phone. Real quick engage. You don't have to worry about, oh, shoot, I meant to tell people that I'm going to be opening the cart to my course tomorrow, or oh, shocks, I meant to push an affiliate link today because they've got a major sale going on. By planning ahead and getting those automated marketing pieces into place, you don't have to worry about that. You can have the fun of engaging with people. You can have the fun. Ideally, you're passionate about your writing. You're passionate about what you're putting out there. Can have all the fun with that. And yes, again, it might be rough at first to sit down for those few hours and get that automated marketing stuff in place and get that scheduling out there, but once it's done, it's done. And that feeling of finally having it off your plate and being able to say, all right, my marketing is taken care of for the week or for the next two weeks, I wouldn't go beyond that. It's all a part of finding your freedom. It's all a part of being able to really, truly enjoy what it is you're building and enjoy blogging, right? Most of us, for the most part, didn't get into blogging because we like marketing, right? I'm an exception to the rule. I love marketing. It is something that I've always been passionate about. It's something that I've been recognized for my work nationally by United Way Worldwide. I've been recognized locally many times on different media platforms for it. But for you and for many other bloggers, most other bloggers, it's not about marketing. It's about writing. It's about sharing your value and your expertise and your love for your niche, for your topic. And so if you can kind of force yourself, if you will, to really sit down and batch out that marketing component and get it scheduled, get it automated, it will serve you all the better to where you're able to engage and get to talk to your audience and really enjoy building up that community that can be found through your blog. It also allows you to eliminate that mindless scrolling. We already talked about that a little bit. Goodness knows I'm guilty of it myself sometimes. We're all human. It happens. But if you aren't jumping on Facebook to just check your own page, right, you get Pages Manager on your phone. Maybe if you're actually getting on Facebook and you start scrolling and you're like, oh, I'll check my page, but this looks like a fun video, or oh shit, a baby, how fun. And suddenly 30 minutes have gone by and you meant to get a blog post out today, but now your kids want dinner and what to do right now, you got to stay up late or get up early in the morning. Just stay focused, keep to the plan, and focus on engaging throughout the week, right? Let your marketing plan run its course and just focus on building relationships with your readers. And then one last thing is that personally, especially when you're first starting off, I really recommend that you hone in on three Facebook communities that will really serve you well, and this will absolutely 1000% change over time. The only Facebook group that I am still in, that I was in when I first started this, again, going on over four years since I've launched Thrifty Guardian is Boss Moms. There have been probably a dozen other Facebook groups that have come and gone, whether it's because the admin closed them down or it no longer served me. Stick to three Facebook groups because you want to find that support, right? You want to find your advocates, you want to find your tribe, and you want to find your readers. And so when you're thinking about those three Facebook groups, definitely find ones that you can network in, that you can find your tribe, that you can enjoy being in, but make sure that at least one of them allows for a promotion of some sort. Now, I'm not saying it necessarily has to be direct promotion, right? Where you're spitting copy trying to get people to join your group program that you're running through your blog next month. Those can certainly work well if they are, well, moderated. But there's something to be said for groups that don't allow direct promotion, right, that only allow for promotion, maybe within somebody asks a question. Again, going back to what's your favorite scheduling software? Or does anybody have any great posts on potty training? Right? It's nice when you're able to put your links in there, but as I said earlier, going back to finding what serves you and what works best for you, that's where it's at is you need to look at those communities as actual communities, not as billboards to market yourself. Right? That's not what we're doing here. We're not just trying to spit our words pump copy everywhere and anywhere we can in the hopes that something sticks. You have to be strategic with your marketing efforts, especially if you want to automate it and get it off your plate and just have it running for a week. You need to be very strategic about it and you need to make it a non negotiable. That is one of my favorite things to say. It is one of my, like it's non negotiable. I don't even know. It is something where if you say something is non negotiable, it's like saying something is unacceptable, right? This is something that I learned with my English professor when I first started at college and she later became my advisor. The power of the word unacceptable or the power of the word non negotiable really will put a stop, put a pin in it, right? So if you tell yourself that it is a non negotiable to sit down and batch out your work and get your marketing plan in place, it is a non negotiable to sit down and get your editorial calendar done for this quarter. It is a non negotiable to be online at least ten minutes a day, not necessarily every single day, 365, because you need to give yourself some breaks. But it's a non negotiable. Four days a week, you're going to be on there engaging in those Facebook communities, engaging with people who are commenting on your stuff, engaging with those who are sharing your content. Non negotiable, meaning I don't care how tired you are, if you haven't gotten your non negotiables done for the day, you best drink some coffee and get it done. Because, trust me, as someone who has been doing this for two decades, somebody who has been in the blogging world for more of her life than not, if you want to find success, whether it's through automated marketing or through affiliate marketing or whatever you plan to do with your blog. If you want to find success, you have to be consistent, you have to have the will, and you have to be willing to say it's non negotiable. You have to be willing to recognize that some nights you might be staying up later than you meant to. Some nights or some mornings, you might be getting up way earlier than you ever wanted to. You're up before the sun. Trust me, when I was quitting looking to quit my nine to five again, my kids were both under two, one of whom was nursing. Meaning every 3 hours, I was either up nursing a baby or pumping. Yeah, I was exhausted. I was working weekends. I was barely sleeping. And did I border and burn out at one point? Absolutely. Recognize that. Step back and trust that you can make this happen. You are in this world. You have launched your blog. You are watching this summit because you are meant to find success and find your freedom through your blog. You just have to keep moving forward. You have to trust in yourself, and you have to make it a non negotiable that you are committed to bringing this blog to life, to finding that freedom, to making that money, to doing whatever it is you want to do with your blog. Whatever that freedom looks like, it makes no matter to me as an individual. But you are meant to better the world with your words. Trust in that and keep moving forward. And then, obviously, if you have any questions, please let me know. Or always, always feel free to reach out via email at ambertamerity. Just kidding. At Amber@thriftyguardian.com. I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have. I promise you, I'm not a pitch artist. I'm not a saleswoman. If you email me with a question, a genuine question, looking for help, whether it's on automated marketing or otherwise, I am going to answer you.

All right, Amber, thank you so much for sharing all that information. I took a ton of notes. I have a lot of action list items to do now. So any final words before we obviously ran to tell them about your freebie and stuff, but any final words of advice or anything?

Amber Lozzi [00:39:05]:
Again, it really does come down to recycling content in a strategic sort of way so that you are able to reuse that genius, that value that you're putting out there, but that it doesn't seem like you are recycling content to your audience. So always keep that in mind that you can recycle your content, you can post it on multiple platforms, but you need to do it in such a way to where your audience can't quite tell you're doing so.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:30]:
Yeah, and that's the difference of quality. When you're producing quality content, you can make it turn it into a quantity game without absolutely.

Amber Lozzi [00:39:40]:
So awesome.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:41]:
Everyone should definitely check out your freebie. She has this amazing freebie and post about helping you to create an editorial calendar. Because I think editorial calendars are clutch. You don't always have to follow them, but they're like the safety net of when you're not sure what to do next.

Amber Lozzi [00:39:56]:
In my mind, when you've got that blinking cursor staring at you absolutely. It's so helpful to have at least a list, if not an actual calendar of ideas to where that blinking cursor isn't causing you to paralyze with fear and not actually put out something. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:11]:
So definitely check that out. And again, thank you so much for being part of the summit. I really appreciate it and you're very welcome. Yeah, we have all your links and stuff so people want to follow your social media. Check out her site. It's fantastic. Check out her I think we're going to have a little something for that in the All Access Pass. We'll be getting the details for that, but again, thank you so much.

Amber Lozzi [00:40:32]:
Thank you.
