Welcome to this advanced email marketing presentation titled How to Pitch Offers through Email and Earn Money on Autopilot.

[00:00:17.290] - Allea
But first, I want to introduce myself. I'm an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter. I help online business owners make a killer first impression using welcome and nature sequences that engage readers, build brand loyalty and optimize conversions for sales and site traffic. I help my clients build intentional relationships with their new subscribers by using email marketing to connect readers with the best resources and solutions that they have to offer.

[00:00:44.110] - Allea
My background's in advertising and actually got started an online marketing as a blogger back in 2016 as I continued to learn the ropes, running a blog and creating content. It became really clear how email marketing is a sustainable and engaging way to connect with readers long term.

[00:01:02.440] - Allea
So I work with clients, including food bloggers, money bloggers, product and course creators and membership communities to create tailored strategic sequences that promote products in content that readers both love and engage with.

[00:01:15.850] - Allea
So you are here today if you want to create intentional automated sales emails that make it easy for your readers to know what you offer, how it helps them, and why it's important that they take action. This presentation will be most helpful to you if you have an offer that is valuable to your audience in your business, whether the goal is for you to build credibility, boost revenue or increase page views, not all sales sequences are selling a paid offer.

[00:01:43.210] - Allea
We are selling an action or a response so offers could include paid products, affiliate, partner products, services, webinar trainings, free content like blog post, podcasts, PDF resources or videos, really anything that could help make your readers life easier, more enjoyable or lead to a positive change in their life.

[00:02:08.890] - Allea
So takeaways you can expect to learn today are why sales copy is different from what you usually write for blog content or social media. What key points need to be defined before you write a sales email, two framework's you can use to create one off emails to promote free low barrier offers. One advanced email strategy for providing valuable content throughout a sales sequence that complements and leads up to a high value offer and how to sell with email marketing automation's without feeling sleazy or manipulative.

[00:02:44.800] - Allea
Everything I'm going to teach you today can be sent to your list automatically using ongoing nurture sequences or "sales funnels", which would be sent out following your welcome sequence. This means your new subscribers will learn about your offers on auto pilot versus requiring you to pitch them through live launches or one off broadcasts. Readers will know you and your brand before you've made a pitch, so you will be a credible source they can trust and you'll experience recurring sales or continued traffic to your site.

[00:03:19.360] - Allea
First, let's start by introducing conversion copywriting. Conversion copywriting is different from content writing and that the goal is to move readers to act. The goal is to convert them to click, buy, engage or share. Conversion copywriting uses proven persuasion techniques paired with knowledge and understanding of your audience to make an informed and intentional strategy. So what makes conversion copywriting work? The value you provide outweighs what you want or ask from your subscribers. So the rule of thumb here is to send three value based emails for every one hard pitch email in a sales campaign.

[00:04:02.440] - Allea
Also, you know what your reader is struggling with and you can speak to their needs and desired outcomes. So it's more than just throwing an offer out to hundreds of inboxes and hoping people will want it. You need to know the humans behind the email addresses. And with conversion copywriting, you're clear about the benefits of your offer to your subscriber. This kind of goes with the last point. But yes, even if it feels like a big accomplishment for you, like launching a book or course, we have to fight the natural instinct to make it about us.

[00:04:37.060] - Allea
It's always about the reader and the positive change they can experience.

[00:04:42.220] - Allea
So think to yourself, why does this matter to them? How does this solve their problem? And lastly, you explicitly state when your readers should take action, smart, clear calls to action make it easier for your reader to know their next step and reduces the fatigue of figuring it out on their own.

[00:05:02.420] - Allea
OK, so how do you find out about this information from your audience? Of course, while you may think that you know, everything there is to know about your audience, because you spend day in and day out serving them or working with them. There's also the other end of the spectrum where maybe you feel like you don't have a clue what they want or why they're even on your list. But either way, I will always suggest one simple thing.

[00:05:26.200] - Allea
Ask. That there are all sorts of tools at your disposal, like surveys I use foureyes. But Google forms would work, use polls on your Instagram stories, prompt questions on your social media posts, and meet one on one for a brief call with somebody from your ideal audience, maybe somebody who's purchased from you before or somebody who's on your list but hasn't purchased. So you can learn more about their thought process and really get into the details of what they were thinking.

[00:05:55.720] - Allea
At this point, we are not simply asking for demographics or preferences. We want to know why they chose to take action, what other alternatives they considered, what sets you or your product or service apart in their minds from your competition and the ultimate outcome that they experience as a result.

[00:06:20.330] - Allea
So, as promised, I'm going to introduce three time tested conversion focus copywriting formulas, I'm going to introduce you to two email framework strategies that are fine for one off emails, and then I'll go into a more advanced strategy for more high ticket offers. All three are great for incorporating sales content into your nurture sequence or automated campaigns.

[00:06:43.850] - Allea
First, let's start with a strategy for smaller, low barrier offers. I'll share two frameworks you can use. I'll cover these briefly, but I want to make sure you know about them since they're really easy to implement. Both are great for gaining site traffic by leading subscribers to free content like blog posts, trial affiliate offers, resources, videos on YouTube and the like. So this one is called the AIDA Email Framework. And here's what it includes. First, we start with attention.

[00:07:15.020] - Allea
The start of your email needs to hook your reader in from the start. This can be done well by using stories, maybe a startling fact, a confession or a hot take. Then we move into interests, we want to keep your subscribers reading by telling them more juicy facts or the details of a story, this is followed by desire. We want to connect everything you've shared so far with how it applies to them personally. This is when we build more emotion into the email.

[00:07:43.350] - Allea
And finally, action at this point. Ask your readers to take the next step to click, reply or buy so it's easy for them to continue their engagement.

[00:07:54.480] - Allea
To show you how this works out, I actually have an example of my own that I can share with you. This is an email that I sent to my list before.

[00:08:02.220] - Allea
So following that structure, attention, interest, desire and action. Let's start here. So as far as attention, I mean, I'm using a gif that's part of it, but also telling them, like you, here on my email is about to find out my big ol' secret, a peek behind the curtain over here at duett and how I managed to nurture my new subscribers without doing more work. You have my attention. Tell me more about how I can do more with less work.

[00:08:30.150] - Allea
Right. And then interest is part of this here. Part of the attention and interest kind of goes together. I'm telling them it's going to make your life in business easier, too. So let's talk about the desire, because I want them to not just blindly trust me, my readers, I want them to really understand why this matters. So to build the best relationships we can with their subscribers, we need to make sure all these subscribers get a kick.

[00:08:56.820] - Allea
Welcome to your e-mail list, say a hi. Hello. And here's how I want to help you. You want to share the best advice, resources or products. You have to help new subscribers solve their problems sooner than later. And we want to introduce your new subscribers to your online ecosystem. So they're caught up in all the things you have or do to support them. So that, yes, I desire that as a reader. I want my subscribers to get that kind of experience.

[00:09:23.880] - Allea
So then we just have to ask them to act. So that feels like a lot. But here's where my workflow comes in and I'm sharing a link to a Podcast that I've been on. So we have attention, interest, desire, all of that leading up into here. It doesn't have to be necessarily broken up into lots of individual pieces at this point. I'm talking about the desire that you have. It's like, no, I'm trying to work up an emotion in you, but this is like I'm promising them some sort of relief because I have this workflow that will help them and then hitting on a little bit more of a desire of like, yeah, you're right, I'm connecting my brain to my heart.

[00:10:00.570] - Allea
That relief makes sense. And you've got a system for me. Yes. I want to click through. Please let me listen to this Podcast.

[00:10:08.830] - Allea
Next is the e-mail framework, this can also be used for sales pages and here's what it includes. First, we start with the problem your reader is facing. We start by identifying a problem they're struggling with at the start of the email. Then through agitation, we drive home the problem with a few more details to really get at the emotion and agitate how they feel about this problem.

[00:10:34.600] - Allea
So if something's unfair, let this section really hit that home. If something is annoying them, give examples to show that you understand. Finally, we wrap this up with a solution. Don't just leave your reader hanging in an emotional state, provide a relief for the problem, and ask readers to engage with the next step to click through to a blog post to learn more or reply to this email to engage with you or watch a video training. So what you've just done is you get their mind prepared and give them the needed context to really show how valuable it is to engage with your offer.

[00:11:12.730] - Allea
Now, to make sense of this framework, I want to show you another example of an email that I sent out to my list. Let's pull it up here. And at this point, we are talking about problem, education and solution. Right? So let me read this email with you. So, hey there. If you spend any amount of time on the Internet? You know that things are always changing tools, trends, even ideas to keep up with these changes.

[00:11:35.860] - Allea
I've done a lot of switching and swapping of things in my business, like moving my email marketing from MailerLite to Convertkit updating the free PDF resources I share on my site, giving tutorial videos to make sure their up to date. But I ran into two problems when it came to updating my resources or tutorials.

[00:11:52.780] - Allea
So I'm positioning this from my right.

[00:11:55.940] - Allea
This is my agitation and I'm hoping that they will also identify with this. So then that's the problem and then I'm agitating it here. But I ran into two problems when it came to updating my resources or tutorials. One, tracking down all the links. I didn't want to ever have to go back and find each and every link to my free resources in order to replace it with the new one and to forget about it, never updating things at all because that's too much work and instead letting my resources rot away into the Internet landfill of outdated materials.

[00:12:28.300] - Allea
Nope, neither of those options work for me. I've agitated like this is how much work it would be if you just keep going with what you're doing. Or the other option is that your resources just get outdated on the Internet and nobody wants that either. So then the solution. So I decided to invest a little time and energy and create a system that would make it super simple to share a resource now, but be able to easily update it later.

[00:12:54.340] - Allea
So how do I do it? Click through to this blog post to find out.

[00:12:59.420] - Allea
And now for offers, the required time or money will expand on the strategy by using the P-A-S-O-P or PASOP strategy, PASOP up is an advance strategy that helps you lead up to a larger pitch of a product or action where you really want people to engage, especially if it will require their time or money, like a webinar or a paid product. So this strategy works great for promoting a specific product or program, encouraging sign ups for a webinar or event, and leading up to a high ticket affiliate product.

[00:13:38.390] - Allea
In a way, the sequence serves as a mini evergreen "launch" once added to your ongoing automated nurture content. So what is the PASOP of strategy? Well, I learned about the strategy from Joanna Weeve got copyhackers.com, so you can find more resources as well as this one over on her website. And you can use this link or you can search for PAS formula and her site should come up. So let's break this down a bit more, even though some of it is a repeat of the strategy we already talked about.

[00:14:10.880] - Allea
First present, a problem your audience is experiencing, then agitate that problem in a really empathetic way. So they really feel the emotion of it. Next, provide a solution to the problem and do your best to answer it in the email versus linking to related resources.

[00:14:28.640] - Allea
Then we're going to pair that solution with an outcome that's possible for them too. We're kind of painting this picture of a desired outcome and potential results.

[00:14:39.530] - Allea
And then before we wrap up the email, tee up another problem they may be experiencing, then tell them you'll be addressing that issue in the next email, in copywriting that's called an open loop. It says, hey, come back for more. Keep an eye out, things like that. So do all of this in three to four emails with the final email only focusing on the PAS like we covered before. And so that final solution would be your offer.

[00:15:05.910] - Allea
Now, let's go into an example so this can make a little bit more sense from a high level view. It'll look like this. So the first email will be all five parts of PASOP. You are the problem, agitation, solution, the outcome, whether it's measurable or you're telling a story and then you're teeing up the new problem. Email two you would repeat the problem that you ended with at the end of email one and then you agitate that, provide a solution, share a potential outcome and then take up another problem.

[00:15:38.090] - Allea
So you can do this in two or three emails. And then on the last email, you just focus on the PAS. Like I mentioned, you repeat the problem, you end it on an email to you'll agitate that. And then your offer is the big solution. With a link to the sales page, learn more about the solution and the outcome it brings. So this is where you would really hit home with click here for this affiliate offer to make sense of everything that we've talked about, all those struggles, all that agitation.

[00:16:06.410] - Allea
This is the solution and this is where you link to it. So these first two emails, two or three emails leading up to that final pitch, if you will, it's really priming their minds to be thinking about this, to become aware of this agitation and this emotion. So that way, when you produce the offer and say, I have a solution for you, they've been thinking about it and they're like, you're right. This is a problem that I need to solve.

[00:16:31.070] - Allea
And they'll be grateful that they have the opportunity to take part in the offer that you have presented. Again and to remind you that this content is not mine. It has been sourced from copyhackers.com, I want to give Joanna all the credit here. And so feel free to click on that link for more options and opportunities for copywriting in sales and conversion techniques. So why does this strategy work? Well, you were giving space in the sale sequence to address major pain points.

[00:17:01.880] - Allea
You're asking questions. You're answering questions. You're kind of bringing these things to light that subscribers might already be thinking and you're providing mindset issues or bringing them to light that really need to be worked out for any number of things that subscribers need to think, do or believe before we can really ask them to act.

[00:17:20.390] - Allea
So the emails all flow together, piece together intentionally to work through one pain point at a time, like a stairstep of questions and answers that they need cleared up in their mind before your offer will make sense to them.

[00:17:34.670] - Allea
To help you better understand this concept, I'm going to share two examples for two different types of offers so you can really see it in action.

[00:17:42.650] - Allea
First, here's an example for a money blogger. In this example, say you're selling a paid training that talks all about how investing works from a high level. Let's look at the journey a subscriber could go through before realizing that, yes, this would be a helpful training for me to feel confident, understanding, investing, because they don't just appear there to walk them through it. So for our core three problems over the course of our emails, the first one is going to address this problem, if you will, or this misbelief that investing is risky and so they aren't even investing.

[00:18:17.330] - Allea
Number two would be that investing is something that you think you have to pay other people for to do for you and that you'd rather just let them do it and not ask any questions. And number three, they're still not sure that they can learn investing well enough, coupled with the opportunity cost of not becoming an informed investor. So at this point, they're like, why try? But we want to couple that with a problem of like, if you don't become an informed investor, there's problems there.

[00:18:44.480] - Allea
So these are the core problems. Another way you could pose this would be thinking, what is it that they have to believe in each of these emails? So you could go with what is the solution? What is the outcome? What is the one thing that we need to sell them on thinking by the end of this email? That's also another way you could frame this up, but we'll dive in with these problems, starting with email one.

[00:19:04.970] - Allea
So with the problem, it's that investing is risky. So you, the reader you're right into hey, you you're not investing because you think it's too risky. Right. And that's a problem because this means you either don't have retirement or savings or you don't have a strategy that will allow you to retire the way that you want. That's a problem.

[00:19:24.350] - Allea
The solution is that in this email, you could teach about two different approaches to investing. You could tell them about how they can DIY it or how they can have it actively managed. So hiring an adviser and the outcome is that people who've taken the time to learn how investing works have experience more confidence to make a plan for retirement that gives them peace of mind. So whether it's DIY or actively managed. And so the problem that we're setting up next is don't assume investing is something you must pay other people for to do for you.

[00:19:54.860] - Allea
And so we can tee it up saying to be a smart investor, you still have to know a few important things.

[00:20:01.850] - Allea
So then we get the email to where the first problem is thinking investing is something that you have to pay other people to do for you. And so we agitate that by saying, what's the danger of thinking in this way? We need to hit this over the head of like you limit your understanding and involvement in your own retirement plan. Plus, there are ways that you can DIY your investments and save on fees if that's what's holding you back. But there's a danger to just assuming that you have to pay other people to do it or you're not doing it at all.

[00:20:31.910] - Allea
So a solution here would be to introduce index funds and how it's really not as risky as you might think. And you could do it yourself.

[00:20:39.440] - Allea
You don't have to pay somebody else to do it for you.

[00:20:42.230] - Allea
The outcome could be, you can DIY invest with very little money up front. Here are a few different places you could do that. And then teeing up the next problem. Still think investing is something you can't fully understand.

[00:20:55.220] - Allea
So at this point, if they're still thinking I have to pay someone else to do it, otherwise it's risky. I'm not going to have retirement. They're aware of all these problems. Right. So we're saying, but tomorrow I'll show you how to be a smart investor, even without a degree in finance to help you better understand all of this. So finally, we get to email three. The problem here is still think investing is something you can't fully understand, because at this point, they know that they need to understand it.

[00:21:19.610] - Allea
But now they're thinking, can I really understand this? So we agitate that by asking or presenting to them. What do you miss out on by not understanding the elements of investing, sort of proposing the opportunity cost. And this is where you would get into the details of money being saved for the future or for your kids college or education or whatever it is that they might want to save up for, what their retirement could look like. They're kind of in the dark and that's not being a smart investor.

[00:21:48.920] - Allea
So we tell them with the solution, become a smart investor without a degree in finance.

[00:21:53.810] - Allea
Learn how investing works. You can gain more control over your finances, become an informed investor, whether you are DIY in your retirement and investing or you're hiring someone to help you manage it. But overall, we know that it's important for you to have a little bit more clarity and drive, if you will, to at least know what's happening with your retirement investments. So the call to action here would say by the training here to learn everything in a clear, unintimidating way.

[00:22:21.560] - Allea
So if you wanted to propose this course differently, say the whole course is about DIY investing, you kind of have to hit on all of the things that they might already know about investing. And maybe they think it's only done in a traditional way. Right, with these actively managed accounts, and then that's another way that you could just tailor the course just specifically to how DIY investing is totally achievable. Here's how you do it. We teach you about it here or here's our resource, or here's this app that you can use.

[00:22:48.340] - Allea
But in this case, we're just sending them to an investing course. And they have a lot of these like major pain points that we need to hit on, investing is risky. They aren't investing at all, investing in something you think have to pay other people to do for you or they're not even sure that they can comprehend how this will work. And so we want to hit on all those before we pitch the next step for them, whether it's a course or a book or an affiliate program, the world is your oyster.

[00:23:14.540] - Allea
OK, now, to help regenerate this framework, let's look at a second example. This will be an example for a business blogger or a coach. So in this example we'll say that you're promoting a higher ticket affiliate product.

[00:23:27.550] - Allea
And the product itself is a course all about building your email list. So from a high level, let's look at the journey a subscriber would go through before saying, yes, this would be a helpful strategy for my online business. So the first problem could be telling them you're only building an audience on social media. But what if that platform goes away? You lose all of your followers. The second one would be worried the email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement.

[00:23:54.280] - Allea
And the third one is just telling them you're missing out. Email will make you more money in the long run, and it has a higher ROI on sales and purchases than any social platform. That's how we've got it framed out. Lets hop into what they would look like individually. So email one. You're only building an audience on social media.

[00:24:10.690] - Allea
That's a problem because what happens if that platform gets shut down or an algorithm makes it impossible for you to connect with your own followers. So the solution is consider how email marketing will be a better long term solution. So you never lose that connection or ability to talk with your audience when you want to. And so the outcome would be connecting with your audience at any time with no algorithms in the way. Teeing up the next problem if you're worried the email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement, I'll tell you why it's worth learning it in my email tomorrow.

[00:24:43.540] - Allea
So for email two, are you worried that email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement. I'll tell you why it's worth learning. It's important to nurture your subscribers who are the most interested and already on your list. You could agitate this by saying, like, if you're continually looking for new subscribers, you could waste less time and just better nurture the people on your list and do a better job of getting them to convert to sales versus always trying to find someone new to join your list.

[00:25:10.540] - Allea
This is another big thing where people think I have to have this huge email list in order for it to be worth it.

[00:25:16.150] - Allea
And this is saying no, like you can just nurture the few people you have really well and see more in sales than you would even with social media and a huge platform.

[00:25:24.220] - Allea
Then the solution could be with simple planning and forethought. It's actually quite easy to make email a regular part of your marketing, and the outcome would be that you're building a loyal following of subscribers who are the first to buy from you when you have an offer or a promotion.

[00:25:38.680] - Allea
And then lastly, we tee it up saying you are missing out on sales revenue if you're not using email. So this is where in the third email we would get into a little bit more of the fact the email is proven to have a greater ROI than social platforms and can make you more money in the long run. So the solution would be start growing your email list and build a loyal fan base who'll buy from you easier and faster than followers on any other platform.

[00:26:03.370] - Allea
This leads into your call to action to purchase this email list building course to get started.

[00:26:08.140] - Allea
So now that you have an understanding of the copywriting frameworks for working with, let's go back and really focus on your offer in your audience to determine what should be in your sale sequence.

[00:26:19.540] - Allea
Clarity is key before copywriting. Not everything under the sun needs to be in your sales sequence. So I'll work through some prompts to help you clarify the main points before you start copywriting. First review and clarifying your offer. What problem does your offer solve? What if happy users of your product or service said about your offer? Look through those to see what problems your product or offer is actually solving. You can ask them these questions in a survey or hop on a call with a couple of your users or students or customers and ask yourself, are you saving them time and money?

[00:26:58.810] - Allea
Or if you're a food blogger, are your recipes helping them adjust to a new gluten free diet? What is the ultimate outcome that people are looking for? Who is your offer for? Your offer is not going to be for everyone. Maybe it makes sense to send it to one part of your list, but not the other. So when you segment your list in your welcome sequence include your relevant offer in each follow up nurture sequence that it makes sense for.

[00:27:26.290] - Allea
For example, if you have a cooking for beginners nurture sequence, you'll share a different offer there, like a "how to start cooking starter kit" then you  would for the people who are pro home chefs, right? So they're in that sequence, they might need to get more advanced meal planning strategies. Secondly, identify important characteristics about your audience. What is your audience currently struggling with? What have they gone to looking for a new solution? This will ultimately identify their big pain points, and that might seem dramatic, right?

[00:28:01.490] - Allea
If you're a food blogger or money blogger, but what is it they're looking for? Are they short on time? Are they frustrated with people talking over them at work about investing or they don't know how to use their 401k? Right. If that's what their big pain point is, identify that. Then explore what other alternatives have they tried and what reservations might they have before trying your solution? What do they need to believe is possible? What fears are keeping them from true buy-in on your offer and we'll kind of come back to this again.

[00:28:37.760] - Allea
But what is their desired outcome? What are the results that they think they're looking for? Revisit your offer. How does what you have to offer help them get to this outcome easier, faster, or maybe with less stress or anxiety?

[00:28:55.340] - Allea
Lastly, consider how you will close the gap for your subscribers.

What does your audience need to know or learn before they can fully participate in your offer? You can often repurpose super valuable content. You already have to help support your subscribers as they move along this journey in this transformation. So, for example, if you're teaching a DIY course, they have to believe that it's worth learning so they can successfully do it themselves. If you're offering an affiliate program, what should they know about your affiliate partner to gain trust in them too, what are the most commonly asked questions you can solve for them proactively?

You can answer these questions by linking to existing content or repurposing blog content into an email or repurpose email content that you've sent out or shared before, or provide case studies, even presenting these kind of pain points or mental blocks as common myths, is really helpful because then you turn around and you get to bust those myths and why they should keep considering to move forward through the transformation and engage with each email and ultimately your offer.
