Hello there, and welcome to my presentation on "Legal Disclaimers Every Blogger Must Know." In this presentation we're going to go over what a disclaimer is, legal disclaimers that bloggers need to know, the importance of placement, and then we will also go over how to write a disclaimer, and I will give you some examples. Before we get into it, hello there. My name is Michelle Murphy. I'm a small-business attorney and the owner of the "CEO Legal Loft." I work with online business owners to ensure that they are legally protected and avoiding costly legal mistakes. In my free time, you can find me watching Psych or Hallmark movies.

So first, what is a disclaimer? It's a notice or a statement designed to limit the liability of a party associated with a website, such as you, if you're the owner of the website or other parties like your employers or customers. It may also inform users of certain risks associated with using the website, such as if it contains adult themes or material that may be offensive to some users.

[00:01:26.950] - Michelle
So what legal disclaimers do you need to know as a blogger? First is "Representations and Warranties." This limits your liability regarding the condition of what you're selling. It's also known as the "as-is" clause. In the case of a website the visitor has to do their own research and due diligence on the information you provide on your website.

[00:01:47.090] - Michelle
Next we have "Omissions, Errors, and Mistakes" disclaimer. This is just saying that the website owner is not liable for any errors or mistakes on their website.

[00:01:56.090] - Michelle
Next we have the "No Professional-Client Relationship" disclaimer. This is for my bloggers who are in the finance industry, legal industry, medical industry, you're a therapist, any of those types of clientele. You're basically saying just because you're consuming content on my website does not mean that you are my client. And even if you're not in those industries, if you take clients, you can also add this. So for my copywriters, graphic designers, all you guys.

[00:02:32.810] - Michelle
Next we have an "Earnings" disclaimer. In an earnings disclaimer, you're telling people that any income claims that you make are not guaranteed to work for someone who has purchased or downloaded content from your website, or even consumed content on your website, so if you have a blog.

[00:02:48.170] - Michelle
Next we have a "Testimonials" disclaimer. This is for people who have reviews on their website. This is basically saying that your experience may not be the same experience as described in the reviews. I'll say this, there's a little bit more that goes into earnings and testimonial-type disclaimers, but that gets really into the nitty-gritty of the FTC, and I don't want to bog you down with that. Basically they're saying, if you have these types of statements on your website, and it is the norm, then you need to have some type of proof and evidence to back that up. If it is not the norm, if this is abnormal, if it is abnormal for someone to make $10,000 from your program, and somebody has put that on their review, you should not be using that review. That's what the FTC has said about using this type of content on your website. So if you allow comments on your blog you're saying that any comments that were made are not the views or beliefs of the operator of the website, so you, and that you as the operator, shouldn't be held responsible for those comments.

[00:04:12.110] - Michelle
Next let's talk about disclosures. Even though we're talking about disclaimers, disclosures are still very important, especially in the blogger world, especially these two that I'm about to start discussing. Basically, a disclosure according to the FTC is saying that you have some type of financial, maybe employment, maybe personal or family relationship with the brand.

[00:04:38.220] - Michelle
The first disclosure we're discussing is an "Affiliates" disclosure. I know you all know what this is. You are just informing users that you have a relationship with the company for a product you're promoting, reviewing, or recommending, and you're getting a commission from it.

[00:04:52.850] - Michelle
Next we have a "Sponsored Post" disclosure. This is if the brand is paying you to display specific content to show to your audience. I assume you already know the difference between affiliates and sponsored posts, but usually sponsored posts, you are getting paid beforehand or you're getting paid a set amount. It doesn't matter how much you convert. It doesn't matter — there's no dependency on someone buying something from you in a sponsored post, whereas affiliates you get commissions based on if somebody has purchased a product using a specific link.

[00:05:31.580] - Michelle
Next, we have a "Copyright Notice." This is a statement that's placed on copies of work to inform the public that a copyright owner is claiming ownership of it. You can put this on the Footer of your website. You can put it in your e-books. You can put it basically anywhere that you have content on. The format of this is the copyright symbol © or the word 'copyright' or the abbreviation COPR, the year of first publication of the work, and the name of the copyright owner. Here it is in real-time. You see the © 2020 - 2023 Michelle W. Murphy, LLC.

[00:06:05.360] - Michelle
Next, let's talk about the importance of placement of your disclaimers. There's no specific law that explains where a disclaimer should be, but it should capture the attention, and it should be obvious. The FTC states that it should be positioned in connection with the content being disclaimed, so it stands out from the rest of the content, and is in an obvious location. You can put this on a separate page and link it in the Footer, or you can explicitly place it on a page like a blog or a sales page. Last but not least, you can put them inside of your Terms and Conditions. Just to show you an example of placement of a disclaimer, here's one on my website.

[00:06:49.960] - Michelle
You can see my Legal Disclaimers right here, right below the orange box where it says, "I need this for only $7." There is a legal disclaimer that says, "This challenge is for educational purposes and is not legal advice. This challenge is not a substitute for an attorney." Additionally, I have a "Professional-Client" disclaimer in the checkout section of this sales page, and it says, "The items in this bundle, including the guide, templates, podcast, and checklist, are not legal advice and is for educational/informational purposes only. Neither the purchase of this template nor the included information form an attorney-client relationship."

[00:07:28.440] - Michelle
Next, let's discuss what should be put inside of disclaimer. The language should be purposeful. Start by clearly stating the purpose of your blog and the intent behind the content. An example would be, "The content on this blog is intended for informational purposes only." Specificity. Avoid vague phrases. Be as specific as possible about what your blog covers and does not cover. You can say something like, "While we strive to provide accurate information on X topic, we do not claim to be experts in Y or Z fields." The Limitation of Liability disclaimers. You're going to clearly state that the information you provide is based on your personal opinions or research and that you're not liable for any outcomes based on the use of this information. An example of this would be, "Readers are advised to consult with a professional before making any decisions based on the content of this blog. We are not responsible for any actions taken due to the information provided." 

[00:08:28.900] - Michelle
You want to make clear distinctions so if you occasionally write sponsored content or blog reviews, clearly differentiate them from your other content. Saying something like, "Some articles on this blog may be sponsored or contain affiliate links, which will be clearly indicated." Additionally, on the actual blog — You can put this in your Terms and Conditions or something like that, or on the blog page, depending on how your website is set up. If you have just a blogs page you can put it on that page, something like this, "Some of the articles on this blog may be sponsored." But on the actual post, if you have a sponsored post, you need to put that, "This blog post is sponsored." Same with blog posts that have affiliate links. You need to say, "This blog post has affiliate links contained inside. I will get a commission if you use these links." It doesn't have to be super like, you don't have to say, "I'll get a 30% commission." You don't have to be super specific. You don't have to say how much you're getting paid. You just need to at least let people know that you are getting paid for this content, or for using your links. And that is all you need to know from a blogger standpoint about disclaimers.
