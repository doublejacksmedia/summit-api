Well, hello there. Welcome to my presentation on monetizing your blog with bundles. So let's start off with a little bit of an explanation about what bundles are and why they work for bloggers. So you can actually see a little bit of a screenshot, a little bit of snippet of a bundle that I recently was a part of as a project manager and as a contributor. So I helped put this one together. This here is a collection page or a redemption page where you can access a whole bunch of different resources. So let me explain what that means in more detail now. So a bundle is not a freebie swap where people swap their email and freebies. It's not a giveaway with one prize winner, and it's also not just all of your products bundled together, which is generally what people think of when they hear someone say a bundle. It's your things together as a collection. Instead, a bundle is a collection of digital products from multiple contributors, each providing a broad selection of resources in the one bundle. So that could be things like workshops, courses, templates, Templates. This example that I've shown here is actually all Notion templates because that is the theme of this particular bundle.

[00:01:37.320] - Bree Boucher
It was designed around Notion, and so that's why everything has a Notion theme to it. So your audience and the audience that you are going to be borrowing can access this bundle for free or by paying with their money. So they either pay via opt-in through email, so they pay with their email, or they pay via actually paying money for the bundle. So I want you to think about a bundle. It's a lot like a buffet in that audience members can sign up for the buffet, and they go ahead and pick and choose from a variety of options, taking just the ones or the things that appeal to them most. So I'm I'm obviously showing you four different things you could select, but maybe not all of them are going to be relevant to your particular example here. So you're not always going to be needing everything in the buffet, but it's nice to know that there's a selection of options there for you. Okay, so how they work. A host organizes the bundle, and they do all of the work, which includes gathering contributors and overseeing the promotion and distribution of the bundle. Contributors join by providing their products and promoting their bundle to their own audiences.

[00:03:09.340] - Bree Boucher
Bundles, as I said before, can be free, paid, or a hybrid of both a free and a paid tier. It's like an upgrade. Why they are great for bloggers? So audience growth is obviously a key one here. Bundles allow bloggers to rapidly grow their email list by reaching a much larger audience when combined with all of the people that are participating and contributing in a bundle. There's also some revenue potential, and that can look like, obviously, the paid bundles. If you're a host of a paid bundle, you're going to be bringing in immediate income. Whereas with a free bundle, if you're a host or a contributor of that, then you are going to be bringing in more traffic and new leads into your ecosystem, and then that will longer term turn into paying clients and customers. You might even have some trip wires and some order bumps and ways to monetize from the very start as well. I wanted to give you an example from last year when I contributed to over 10 bundles in 90 days. My list grew by over a thousand people, many of whom are still engaged a year later. And I've also seen hosts trapped upwards of 2000 leads with just one single bundle.

[00:04:30.740] - Bree Boucher
Okay, so you're probably like, cool, that sounds exciting, but who the hell are you? Who am I talking? Who's talking to me right now? Hello, I am Bree. My name is Bree Boucher. I'm an introvert and INFJ. I am Australian. And I am a NLP, Clinical Hypnosis and EFT tapping Practitioner. I'm a certified coach, a strategist, and a mentor. So I'm an introvert visibility coach, and I work exclusively with introverted creatives, coaches, consultants to grow their visibility, community, and income through collaborations. I'm the host of a whole bunch of different communities, my bundles of bundles, Facebook group, the Collab Club over in school. Plus, I have my amazing membership, CollabBetter. And I'm the creator of the Innovative Bundle Flipbook method, which is just one of the many different types of bundle methods out there. So let's get into this again. You probably heard me say 2000 leads and you went, hello, how can I do this? I want to join. I want to do all the things. How do I get all those leads? So the first thing we need to do is figure out how ready you are to host a bundle. So there's a few things that I recommend you have, I guess, under your belt before you even consider hosting a bundle.

[00:05:58.390] - Bree Boucher
And here's a couple of them. So you want to have digital sales experience. So ideally, you've sold digital products before and you're comfortable with all of the systems that go with that. So I'm talking having workflows, automations, upsell as order bumps, those things I was talking about before, because that will help you make the most out of hosting the bundle. And obviously, if you're wanting to contribute as well, you're going to want to have those things in place too, right? So it's really important to to understand all of those back-end processes before you even consider managing a bundle yourself. I like to think that anyone that's hosted a bundle has actually contributed to a bundle in the past. So at least a handful, maybe three bundles that you've participated in. And that will give you some really great insight as to what works well and what doesn't. So as a contributor, you'll get behind the scenes glimpse of all of the things that happen when you are hosting a bundle. You obviously don't have to do all of the work, but you get to see the volume of copy that's written, the amount of communication backwards and forwards, all of that stuff you get to see.

[00:07:18.500] - Bree Boucher
And without having been part of a bundle at that level, you probably might think, oh, I'm sure it's going to be easy. What do I do? I just get some people together and that's it. I'm afraid to know you there's a lot more to it than just that. So as you can imagine, participating lets you learn from other's successes and allows you to be a stronger host as a result. Having things in place to track and pay affiliates, this is obviously more so for paid bundles. But I think it's also important to have those systems, like I was saying before. So software where that actually does the work for you. So having affiliate links and ways to capture that information is going to make a big difference when you are hosting. And even just if you're not even having a paid bundle, even just knowing that your contributors are doing their part in promoting, because you can see and track their use of the affiliate link as well, even if there's no cost to the end user for the bundle. So again, that goes back to software proficiency. So there's a lot of different tools that either you're going to need to get used to or learn that you haven't used before.

[00:08:48.080] - Bree Boucher
Things like Airtable may not be something you've used much, but it's probably the best way to actually coordinate and manage a bundle because there's a lot, again, of moving parts. You can use it for your project management, so like your to-do list. But you can also use it as a way to capture the contribution, information through forms and to coordinate all of that with the people that you're working with and just really just managing all of the logistics that goes on with that. With Airtable, you can send automations out, so you can actually send emails out based on particular statuses and things like that. So that's just one example. But there are other software and tools that you need to be across that maybe you haven't learnt before. Just being able to learn on the go or have a bit of a background in it already is really important. And then communication and collaboration skills. So you want to be able to really communicate well with others. You as the host are going to be leading a team of contributors to do the best they can to promote the bundle, right? So making sure that you're available to and have the capacity to keep up with frequent communication with your collaboration team is really, really important.

[00:10:19.680] - Bree Boucher
And if you don't think you can, you can also hire people to do that element for you as well. Whether it's a VA or a project manager, there's people out there that know how to manage these sorts of things, too. You want to have an audience for a promotion. So ideally, you already have a bit of a core audience to promote your bundle to, even if it's small. This is really important for bundle hosts that you do start at least with a little bit of a base, because as the host, you're doing the vast majority of the promotion, and then you're also borrowing the audiences of your contributors. So there needs to be a little bit of a base to start off with. And then the ball starts to get rolling because it's really important to get traffic to the page. And oftentimes You're sending maybe an email every day for the period that the bundle is promoted, but your contributors are only sending one or two emails. So we need to make sure that it's constantly in someone's radar because we're actually generating the traffic to the page and all of that stuff. So I think at least a little bit of an audience already.

[00:11:40.720] - Bree Boucher
Obviously, a bundle will grow your list. So I don't expect people to have thousands of people on their email list at this point. That's what a bundle can offer them. But having a core engaged audience to talk to will help and really increase the impact for your contributors as well. And then lastly, but not least, you want to have a good chunk of time in order to coordinate the bundle. So I suggest that a bundle when you're hosting is a 90 day commitment minimum. So it can take upwards of three months or more to plan, organize and execute a bundle. That includes some of the earlier planning stages and recruiting contributors But you can start some of the ideation and the recruitment months before you even actually get fully into the bundle. So there's a lot, as I said before, a lot goes into it. I don't want to scare you away from hosting, but I want you to know that it's not a tick and a flick and it's done thing. There's lots of bits and pieces that goes into it. So making sure that you have a good chunk of time. It's a solid the project that you'll be working on, like hours of your day will be, most weeks will be taken up with something to do with the bundle.

[00:13:10.180] - Bree Boucher
So making sure that you have time to plan and execute each stage so that you're not overwhelming yourself And again, you can hire people like myself who can support you in doing this. But if you're wanting to manage this yourself, giving yourself as much time and window to work on a project is always going to be a really great thing to do. So if hosting feels like a little bit of a future goal, that's totally fine. I don't think it's for everyone straight away. It might be something that you want to do down the track, but potentially you're actually more suited to contributing to a bundle first. So contributing could be your longer term goal instead of hosting. And that's totally fine. So start off with participating, like you said, and then really work up to becoming a host as you get more comfortable with the whole concept. I recommend to you listen to my Bundle Secrets podcast. There's a couple of episodes that will help you go a little bit deeper, knowing about whether you're ready to host and some do's and don'ts. Those two are really good episodes to look out for. And there's a few other really good episodes on there, of course, as well.

[00:14:29.980] - Bree Boucher
All right, let's talk a bit more about monetizing through participation versus creation. Okay, so you want to choose the best strategy for you. And as I said before, that could be participation, are you contributing to the bundles or hosting your own? So with participation, that is going to minimize the risk to you and it won't cost as much in terms of energy and finance experiences as well. But you'll still gain the exposure. And then hosting, you're going to be obviously maximizing the revenue potential and you're going to be building your authority and being out there and having your products being more visible as well. So monetising through participation can look like having a bundle, being in a bundle allows you to grow your list with minimal risk and investment. So basically, as I said before, you're borrowing someone's audience, you're borrowing the host's audience and the other contributors that are participating in the same bundle with you. So you do that to gain larger exposure. So obviously, people are going to find your product in the bundle, and then it's your job to nurture them and connect with them after the fact. So this is a low cost option with high reward.

[00:16:01.200] - Bree Boucher
So generally, participation is free. Occasionally, there is a fee associated, but oftentimes that is actually a sponsorship fee. So you can choose to sponsor a bundle to have a higher presence in the bundle. So in exchange, as I said earlier, you contribute a digital product or some description. You do your bit to promote the bundle, and then you get access to everyone that actually opts into your specific offer. So you don't actually get access to the entire list of people that opt into the bundle. You only have access to the people that select your thing, which is actually a really good thing to have because it means that your people that join your list are actually interested in what you're sharing and what you're selling and the thing that you're talking about the most. So really by joining someone else's bundle, it's the best way to dip your toes into collaborations more broadly. Bundles are like those earlier stage offers that you can consider being a part of in the collaboration space. It's low risk and it exposes your brand to a new and relevant audience. Whereas the other option, monetising through hosting, that can look like where you actually have the control over the content, like the theme of the bundle, like the example I showed before.

[00:17:37.210] - Bree Boucher
You could have a very specifically themed bundle that is talking to your topic, your niche, your expertise. You also have control over the people that you decide to collaborate with, the other contributors. You get to choose who is being a part of this collaboration. When you're contributing to other people's bundles, you don't have that control, obviously. You're just one of many, whereas in this instance, you decide who gets to be included in this bundle with you. It also obviously allows you to keep the largest share of the revenue. Even if you're hosting a paid bundle, you as the host will get the majority of the income and you ideally would have an affiliate commission that you pay your contributors when they sell their, a bundle through their affiliate link. But obviously, as the host, you get the majority and they get a portion. Okay, so the benefits of hosting a bundle is you have the revenue potential. So as I said before, paid bundles allow you as the host generate direct income from the bundle itself. And of course, you have the opportunity to generate income through order bumps, trip wires, upsells, those sorts of things that happen during the bundle promotion window.

[00:19:15.020] - Bree Boucher
And then obviously also the back-end offer, because I like to think of bundles as a lead-generating activity that then ultimately leads into the thing that you want to sell on the back-end. And so oftentimes Sometimes, that's one of the core things I teach, is knowing what you actually want to sell and then work backwards from there in order to decide on what your bundle is going to look like. So even free bundles can drive some significant traffic to your other products and services, especially if you're hosting your bundle on your website. So they're going to sign up for the bundle and take some time going through and redeeming offers on your website. But you can also then retarget. You can have ways to bring them back to certain pages on your site through pop-ups and other things like that. And later, like I said before, driving them to other products or services. Another really good benefit is your brand authority. So as the host, you become the connector in your industry, you're building authority and you're strengthening relationships. So not just You're building your authority to your audience or new audience around hosting, once you've hosted this particular topic or theme of your bundle.

[00:20:41.970] - Bree Boucher
But also you're connecting with more people in your niche and within your industry. And you are then seen as an authority within that space as well, because you've made those connections. You've been the go to person for that topic. So it helps outwardly and outwardly in terms of authority building. And the other thing to consider is there's a significant It's really an investment in planning that's required. So we need to remember that there is the up front planning. There might be some financial investment, whether it's having your VA work a little bit extra in that time frame to help support you with coordinating a bundle, hiring someone to host for you, or even just the fact that during the time that you're hosting a bundle, that could be a time where you are taking a step back from what you might have ordinarily spent that same amount of time on promoting a different product. And so there might be a loss in revenue in order for you to gain a good chunk of more people on your email list. It's one of those slingshot concepts where you're stepping back in order to slingshot forward. And that in itself could be something you need to consider as well.

[00:22:16.690] - Bree Boucher
The management of the collaboration can be quite energetically a huge investment, but the payoff can be substantial. So it It might be actually a good thing to consider. Hosting a bundle, I like to think of it as like your host of a party. So you send the invite, you coordinate everything, and you ensure everyone has a great experience. Plus, you get all of the present, ie, the leads, as a reward for your effort. Let's go with some practical tools for streamlining your collaborations. So if bundles are sounding good and you're thinking you're ready to host, here's tools that you will need to have access to in order to, I guess, do well. So Airtable is one, having a bunch of or a couple of different hosting tools and payment tools, and then either Notion or Google tools are the other. So let's get into those. Airtable, as I highlighted before, is really great for tracking contributions, organizing your submissions, and managing timelines with your contributors. And also internally with your team members. Airtable really simplifies everything from the initial outreach to monitoring contributor engagement. So it's like your command center, like the place you always go as you're hosting a bundle to help you track every detail for a smooth and organized bundle experience.

[00:23:50.890] - Bree Boucher
Hosting and payment tools. So when you actually make the decision to host a bundle, there is a lot of additional decisions now that need to be made. And some of those are deciding the type of method that you're going to be delivering the bundle through. So oftentimes, you'll use the software you already have in place, but that might mean that you need a connector tool that helps you to distribute the information. So if you remember the image that I shared right up the top, it was like a graph or a table of contributions that are using a third party tool to embed that into my website. So there are different tools that you need to consider. And so, like I said before, there's different decisions need to be made around the type of bundle you're hosting. So things like Thrivecart or other software, cart software, can be really useful to help you handle payments, but also for things like managing the affiliate tracking. And if you do go ahead with a paid bundle, it allows you to then pay the affiliates their commissions as well. So yeah, having a system for affiliate payments ensures that each contributor is motivated to promote the bundle.

[00:25:29.170] - Bree Boucher
So it's really a really good way to, I guess, incentivize even a free bundle because you can then mention, we'll let them know that there's an upsell. So oftentimes people will put an order bump connected to the bundle, which then allows someone to generate some income from that, even though it's a free bundle. So So for affiliates, there's that incentive or added benefit for sharing because they're getting a kickback on that. And then in terms of some other tools, so either depending on how you operate, you might prefer Notion or you might prefer Google tools. So Notion lets you contain everything in one place, whereas Google tools like Sheets, Docs, and Google Drive. You can actually connect them together quite nicely. And they'll be great for bringing together, storing this swipe copy or writing this swipe copy and then storing the graphics and helping to map out timelines and stuff like that. My personal recommendation is Notion because it does keep it all in one place and it just makes it nice and easy and clean for everyone to access what they need to, because you can even download graphics from within the Notion page.

[00:27:07.840] - Bree Boucher
You can share a calendar in there so people can see the timeline for the promotional window. They can add that to their own calendar. There's so many things they can do. You can even use it as an alternative to Airtable, especially now that there are things like forms and stuff coming in natively to the software. So just having those core aspects are going to be really useful for you. So if you already know some of these tools, then you are ahead of the game. Okay, so that is my presentation. I wanted to share with you a couple of next steps that you can take if you're ready to take action. So the first thing is you'll find a link to my freebie, My Bundle Secrets podcast. So I mentioned that earlier, there's a couple of podcast episodes you'll want to check out. So tune in to that for insights and bundles from participating through to hosting. There's a whole bunch of different episodes in there. There's a couple of debriefing type ones where I talk to other hosts. And yeah, there's some great content in that. If you are thinking you want to try your hand at hosting a bundle, then inside the speaker bonus bundle, you will find my workshop called, So You Want to Host a Bundle?

[00:28:35.980] - Bree Boucher
Now What? That's really great if you are thinking about hosting that bundle, are you unsure of those next steps? And it covers everything from planning through to promoting your bundle. So it's actually a workshop with some additional resources. And I like to share this a lot as the first stepping stone. So sometimes it's even good to what to watch the workshop because if you're still thinking, I wanted to host a bundle, but you're like, is it now or is it in six months time, being able to watch this workshop will actually give you some really good clarity about how ready you are. So it actually helps with your readiness aspect of hosting a bundle. And it gives you some timeline So you know what actually is involved. And it gives you a bit more of a thorough understanding of everything. So even for people that are thinking about down the ..., definitely grab it now while you can and come back to it when you are ready to consider hosting a bundle. So there you go. That is my workshop. I hope you have enjoyed this presentation. Make sure to find me on social media @TheBreeBoucher.
