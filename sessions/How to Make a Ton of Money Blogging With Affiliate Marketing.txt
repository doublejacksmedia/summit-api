Hello there, and thank you for being a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am so excited to be talking to you today about how to make a ton of money blogging with affiliate marketing. My name is Shelley, and I am going to tell you everything I learned on my journey to making big bucks doing this stuff with my blog. So here's me in Campeche, Mexico, in the Yucatan Peninsula, and here's what you need to know about me. In April 2020, I started my very first blog ever, ever, ever, ever and I made zero dollars that year, no big surprise there. Um, 2021, I discovered affiliate marketing, and I really decided to, like, dip my toes in although it was new and it was scary. And I ended up doing, okay, $8,490 that year. So first blog ever, I'm only eight, eight months in here because I didn't blog for all of 2020. I waited to start a travel blog till there was a global pandemic. But you'll see that the story turns out pretty, pretty good for me. So, 2021, things started looking up and I decided from there I'm going to double and triple down on this affiliate marketing thing. So in 2022, I got serious, like I told you, and I closed out that year at $272,569.

[00:01:36.550] - Shelley
So a lot is possible, and I was only in my second year of blogging with no prior blogging experience. So that's 3,110% more money in just one year. And before blogging, I was actually someone who works in corporate America, and there is no such thing as a 3,110% raise in one year. So this was astonishing to me. In 2023, I doubled my income again, and my story is pretty really incredible. I know that not everyone has success like this, but I also know that it's possible. But it landed me some really good features in some pretty prestigious places like Entrepreneur. I was on the Niche Pursuit Podcast and things like that. And I'm excited to be presenting to you today at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. So, let's dive in. This is what we're going to be talking about. We're going to start with the big question, what is affiliate marketing and why I think you should be starting it now, not when you hit some magic number. We'll get into it. And the second thing is the right blog traffic, search intent, and buying keywords which I really think is paramount to understanding why I've been successful doing affiliate marketing. The customer journey funnel, if you have never heard of that, don't worry, you will be a customer journey funnel pro in no time.

[00:03:03.890] - Shelley
The number one mistake I think bloggers are making when it comes to affiliate marketing, and if you're doing it, why you need to stop ASAP --  and I'm going to give you three quick tips for affiliate conversions so you walk away with some actionable advice at the end of the presentation. And then if you stick around to the end, I have a freebie for you and I'll tell you where to grab it. So what is affiliate marketing? We have to know what we're talking about, right, to like understand it. So it's essentially selling the products, services, and/or goods of someone else, and then you making a commission from the sale, and you've probably already done it. So, if you -- if you have a hang-up a little bit on getting started or, you know, like a mental block on why you haven't got started yet, you've probably done this before. So, if this looks familiar, you're going to see where you've done affiliate marketing. So, let's say that's you and me and we're having a conversation and we both are two people who have sensitive teeth so you're going to ask me as a friend what do I think is the best toothpaste for us two people who have sensitive teeth, and I'm going to say Crest is the best for us.

[00:04:14.730] - Shelley
I have no idea. I don't have sensitive teeth. This is totally a hypothetical example. But if then you go out and you buy that toothpaste based on my recommendation, I've been an affiliate marketer for Crest, for Crest toothpaste. Unfortunately, in this example, I did not make any commission. But that's essentially affiliate marketing. It's me promoting, in this case, Crest and you buying the Crest, and I am so that middleman as a marketer. So, that's affiliate marketing. And like I said, you've probably already done it. So, when should I start doing affiliate marketing? Right now. I think bloggers should start right now. I think a lot of people get hung up on like I have to hit this number in traffic or I have to do these certain things and then I'll start. No, you don't have to hit any magic number and no, you don't have to do any certain things to get started with affiliate marketing. So a lot of bloggers are trying to get onto Mediavine which is a huge milestone and something to definitely be celebrated when you hit that magic number of 50,000 sessions which is what they require. And that's a session is essentially a person -- fifty thousand people coming to your site in a 30-day period.

[00:05:32.230] - Shelley
If you're new to blogging or you just haven't really hit that traction yet to where you're getting big and bigger numbers in traffic, that might seem impossible. It's not. I have three blogs on Mediavine. I should have a fourth one on in the next couple of months. So it's possible. But I think people get hung up a lot on that 50,000 number. So, if that's something maybe you identify with, don't let it stop you. Fifty thousand is a lot. It's doable, but it's a lot. So, if that's something, like I said, getting in your way, please stop -- please stop letting it. So it's a lot of traffic, as I've said. But with affiliate marketing, you don't need a lot of traffic. You just need the right traffic. So, what am I talking about? What's the "right blog traffic"? I'm going to tell you right now. The right blog traffic for affiliate marketers is the people who want to buy the things you're selling in that blog post. Sounds simple, right? So here's you and me again continuing conversation and if you're thinking like, but I'm not psychic I don't know who wants to buy what. Well, the good news is I'm not psychic either, but I do have an understanding of people who want to buy things based on the search terminology that they're using.

[00:06:50.940] - Shelley
So, don't worry. You don't have to be psychic. You don't have to hit 50,000 sessions to be an affiliate marketer, and you don't have to be psychic either. So, what you do need is to understand search intent. So search intent is the intent behind the search, just like the name says, or in other words, what the searcher hopes to find with that search, and there are a couple of different types of search intent. There's -- these are generally considered the main four. Some people say there's more than four. But for the purposes of, of what we're explaining today, you just -- these four should suffice. But if you Google types of search intent, you might see more on the -- on the list. So the first type is called informational search intent. So someone might look up what is SEO. Like, ask that question. This person just wants an answer to their question. They just want information. They don't want to buy my SEO course. They, you know, don't want to know how to start a blog. They just want to know what is SEO. They just want information. The second type of search intent is called navigational. This person might type in something or speak into Google, something like Reddit login.

[00:08:02.760] - Shelley
All they want to do is be navigated to the login page so they can log into their Reddit. They just want to be navigated. That's why it's called navigational intent. Another type, three and four can get -- overlap a little. So hopefully, this is going to explain it. Transactional intent -- I've also seen this called a branded search. So, this person is searching Nike sale. They don't want sneakers on sale. They don't want to know a comparison of sneakers. They want Nikes that are on sale, so that you can see just by typing in Nike or saying Nike into Google, it's become a branded search. They're not interested in Reeboks on sale. They're not interested in Pumas on sale. They want Nikes only. So that's why it's called a branded search. Commercial intent is someone who wants to make a purchase. They have a commercial intent like the name says, but it's not necessarily brand specific. So these people might type in or speak into Google best sneakers for runners. This commercial intent keyword can also be called a buying keyword or buying keywords. So I hope that made a clear distinction between transactional, commercial. But there is some clear overlap there.

[00:09:15.540] - Shelley
But the people we want to target as affiliate marketers are the commercial intent people. So, what are buying keywords? So I just mentioned it in the last slide a little. They're keywords that indicate the searcher is ready to buy or book, but they are not -- they are no longer browsing. So we're going to dissect this a little more with some examples because I know some of this stuff is easier -- we could talk about it in the abstract, but it makes sense with, with real-time examples. So I have some travel blogs. I have four travel blogs to be exact. So I use a lot of examples from travel, but this really applies obviously to every, every niche out there. No matter what site your niche is in this just comes straight from marketing. So, buying keywords in the travel niche, someone might type in best hotels in Paris, best tours in Paris, car rentals in Paris, airport shuttle in Paris, best luggage for these people, let's say best luggage for backpacking Europe, something like that. Those people are ready to buy. While, yes, sometimes browsing people who, who are bored or who are sitting in a doctor's or who are killing time at work till the end of the day they might Google best hotels in Paris.

[00:10:35.150] - Shelley
But by and large, the person searching that is ready to book a hotel. Browsing keywords, on the other hand, are things like, what's the best time to visit Paris? Is Paris worth visiting? Paris in the summer? Is Paris expensive? Is Paris safe? Things like that. These people are still just collecting information. They are browsing. Let's say you have the month of March off and you Google, what's the best time to visit March, and excuse me, visit Paris. And you see a lot of sites that bring up visiting in March. Like, it's so beautiful in the springtime. All the flowers are blooming, etc, etc. And you're like, oh, I have time off in March, like, that aligns perfectly. But you're still in that part of gathering. You're still in the gathering information phase of travel planning. You're not ready to book a hotel yet. You just wanted to know if it aligned that when you were able to travel is a good time to travel to that specific place. So, these are not the people that are ready to buy, so we shouldn't be pushing things on them. This is a huge kind of push back I get of people being like I don't want to do affiliate marketing because it's  "salesy".

[00:11:45.680] - Shelley
It is to people like this that don't want to buy. But the people "googling" best hotels in Paris they're begging to know the best hotels in Paris. They're -- they have what I call a finger on the buy button, credit card in hand, they're ready to book. You are not being salesy to those people because they want to buy something. So this is a big distinction that I make. And I really think this is probably the most paramount thing that you need to understand in order to be an effective affiliate marketer people who want to buy and people who want to browse. Grey area keywords -- I have -- this has come up a lot. I do a lot of one-on-one work with private clients, and people will bring up what I have now labeled grey area keywords. So these are the ones that indicate that the searcher might want to buy or book, but they also might not want to -- and encourage people to stay away from these. Here a couple of examples, again from travel, but this applies to every niche. These are the big, big ones that I see in travel of best day trips from Paris. We'll just keep going with Paris.

[00:12:55.660] - Shelley
So, yes, someone might want to book a tour and they Google day trips from Paris instead of tours from Paris. But they also might want to rent a car and go on their own. They also might want to get on public transportation and go on their own. So there's a lot of what ifs here. This is a grey area, like I said. Now, how do we know these people don't want to book a tour? Well, we don't. But we also do know that the people who definitely do want to book Google tours in Paris. So this is why I say this is in a grey area. You see a couple more neighborhoods in Paris. People might do or make that blog post and put in a lot of different options of hotels that they want to book. Like I said, these people might want to book a hotel and they also might want just neighborhood recommendations. So they're just not far enough down the customer journey funnel, which we're going to get to, to guarantee that they're ready. The fourth one for travel bloggers, I see this one come up a lot packing lists -- so packing lists for Paris or for wherever.

[00:14:08.100] - Shelley
Now, why are packing lists in the grey area? Here is a screenshot from one of my niche sites. It is a packing guide to Tulum, Mexico. The number one thing I have on there is a SIM card. I genuinely believe that people going to Tulum, Mexico do want to have cell phone service when they get there. So, this is the first thing I put at the top of my packing list blog post. Now, someone might buy this. They very well might. However, someone who definitely wants to buy a SIM card for Paris, for excuse me, for Tulum and knows that they want to buy it and they don't need me to convince them, like I said, credit card in hand, finger on the buy button people they're going to Google something like best SIM card for Tulum. So, I still have, like, an uphill battle to convince these people that they want to buy a SIM card. I do genuinely believe that they do, like I said, but that doesn't mean that they're going to. Some people who are looking up a packing list online just want inspiration. They're not buying a single thing from your packing list. They're going to use whatever they have at home, or they're going to try to borrow something from a friend.

[00:15:15.830] - Shelley
They're just not buying. That's just not where they're at. They want to just know what to put on their packing list, and they'll figure out the rest, even if they have to like MacGyver some stuff for themselves. So they're just not buying. So that's why a packing list is in the grey area. I sincerely hope bloggers who want to make money doing affiliate marketing will avoid these types of pieces of content or just, you know, manage your expectations. Know that they're not really going to bring in, like, those big, big payouts month after month for you. To the customer journey funnel -- besides search intent and understanding buying versus browsing keywords this is the next most important thing that you need to understand about affiliate marketing if you want to make a ton of money doing it. So the customer journey funnel is essentially the buyer, or in your case, the blog reader's trip through the purchase funnel which I am about to show you. But just for reference, this can also be called the buyer funnel, the sales funnel, or anything with funnel at the end when we're talking about marketing is going to relate to this. So here's some illustrations so you understand.

[00:16:25.880] - Shelley
This is a four-step funnel. It covers basically everything you need to know on the topic of the customer journey funnel. But if you Google this, it's a big rabbit hole to jump down to. You might see much more elaborate funnels. You might see customer journey funnels that go into customer attention funnels. This is a huge topic. But for just to dip your toes in, this is as much as you need to know. And there's our two people jumping and back flipping into the top of the funnel at phase one which is called the awareness phase. So, the awareness phase is when someone becomes aware of a place they want to travel, let's say. This may or may not even come from you. They might see a really cool Instagram reel or TikTok of a place. They might watch a movie that's, you know -- they might watch the Emily in Paris on Netflix and decide they want to go to Paris. So, this doesn't necessarily come from you, but this is when the person enters the funnel at the awareness phase. After awareness, they move further down the funnel to the interest phase. So, this is when they're going to begin researching a place they want to go.

[00:17:36.080] - Shelley
So they watched Emily in Paris. They saw all the amazing, beautiful locations, and now they're going to Google something like best time to visit Paris. Is Paris worth visiting? Is it expensive? Is it safe? Those kinds of things that we talked about earlier in the presentation on gathering information. They just have informational intent. These people are not ready to book a hotel. They're not ready to book a tour. They're not ready to book a rental car. They don't want to buy a new backpack for backpacking Paris. They're just gathering information. Then they're going to go a little further down the funnel to the desire phase. So, let's say you saw your Emily in Paris. You looked up that time to visit Paris. It happens to be one of the months of the year you were considering. So now, you're going to go further down the funnel and your search intent is going to change and the things you search are going to change. So you might Google best neighborhoods in Paris, three days in Paris, or however many days like a Paris itinerary, a packing list for Paris. So this is exactly where we see our grey area keywords. But these are not the buyers.

[00:18:45.520] - Shelley
These are not finger-on-the-button, credit card, and hand buyers. Those people are down here the bottom of the funnel people. They want to book or buy, but they are not interested any longer in browsing. They've already gone through the whole funnel. They've done their homework, and they've researched as much as they needed to research. So, you saw Emily in Paris. You looked up the best time to visit Paris. It just so happens to be your birthday month and you're dead set on Paris now. Now you're looking at best neighborhoods in Paris because you don't know where to stay. You've looked -- you found the 9th Arrondissement and you're like that's where I'm going to stay. Now, you start "googling" best hotels in the 9th Arrondissement in Paris. You are ready to book your hotel. So, these are the people that we want the people in the action phase -- bottom of the funnel people that lead to conversions. Conversion is just a fancy word for sale where you convert a blog reader into a buyer. So, buying keywords this is what they're going to be searching in the bottom of the funnel purchase phase. Best hotels in Paris, like I said -- best tours in Paris,

[00:19:56.900] - Shelley
car rentals in Paris, travel insurance for Paris -- things that people book. Seem simple, right? Like sometimes you -- it doesn't -- it's not as simple until someone explains it, like, in real, just English terms. So this stuff is probably right in front of you the whole time. But like I said, I work with a lot of one-on-one clients, and there're people are like, wow, why didn't I get that. Sometimes you just need it explained. So, I hope that all made a lot of sense for understanding really the roots of affiliate marketing. So this is what I see the number one mistake travel bloggers make, or any bloggers, when it comes to affiliate marketing, it's what I have seen called the spray and pray or throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping that something sticks. So, when you're not making content with user intent in mind, when you're just throwing spaghetti at the wall and you're happy that something sticks, I tell people you're putting in affiliate links but you're not necessarily doing affiliate marketing. So, when you're making affiliate marketing posts, posts that you hope to make a lot of money for you month over month while you sleep, I want you to ask yourself this before you make that post,

[00:21:18.620] - Shelley
is this a hell yes, a buying keyword. Is it a hell no, a browsing keyword. Or is it maybe a grey area keyword. I hope that you will only make those hell yes, buying keywords, bottom of the funnel, buying search intent posts because those are the ones you're going to see big money from in affiliate marketing. So, this is who I want you to picture. This lady sitting at her laptop, credit card in hand, big smile on her face, doesn't feel like you are salesy, completely ready to buy what you're selling. This is the hell yes, in action. This is who you want to be making content for in order to be a successful affiliate marketer. So, my best affiliate marketing advice is obviously, I've said it before, just to reiterate, stop wasting your time with the maybes. You want the hell yes people. So as promised, I want to leave you with some actionable items. For people who already have affiliate content, you can hopefully make some quick tweaks that are really going to be very effective. And if you've never made affiliate content, you can just implement these already. You don't have to redo any posts. So no matter where you're at these three quick tips should help you.

[00:22:48.390] - Shelley
Tip number one, what I call the feature box in the intro. You can see here that this is a blog post on Food Tours in Tulum. You can see the title at the top. Then I have my number one recommendation for the best food tour in Tulum right at the top of the post. People don't necessarily want to comb through 3,000 words on best food tours in Tulum to find the one that you think is best. So, I like to put these right in the intro to the article. I like to use wording like, don't have time to read the whole article, no worries, this is my best one. And I like to qualify or quantify why I'm calling it the best. In this case, you can't beat the ambience. You can see that it's a private dinner party in the jungle. So I'm saying you can't beat the ambience and the food. So something else there might work like it has 8,000 five-star reviews. So, it doesn't matter if you're qualifying with words or quantifying with the number. But I like to kind of just put the number one recommendation right at the top or, you know, a link to, to where they can book.

[00:24:01.600] - Shelley
I think a lot of affiliate marketers kind of bury their links. Again, a lot of people don't want to feel quote unquote salesy, but someone "googling" food tours in Tulum wants to book a food tour in Tulum. So, they're not going to really identify it as being salesy. They're just happy that they're finding someone that's producing content that, you know, is navigating them towards where they can find the best food tour in Tulum. So, don't hide your links. Okay. Here is tip two, make sure your links stand out. Like I said, I've worked one on one with a lot of people, and I've seen this more times than I wish I had, some people just have navy blue links and black text. And I'm like, oh, my God, I think people just aren't seeing your links. So make your links stand out. I use a theme called Kadence. It's a free theme. Yes, I run a multiple six-figure business on a free theme, and this is called -- I believe it's called highlight on hover. It's in the settings for the links, and I think other themes have different -- similar features but maybe with a different name. So the link is actually this pink, pink color, but when you hover it it highlights in that same color.

[00:25:20.750] - Shelley
So, there's no mistaking that this is a link. So, yeah, make sure your links stand out. And then tip three is use a clear and obvious call to action or CTA. So this is you can see down here, check rates and availability for this food tour. This is not the place to be creative just tell people what that link is going to lead them to do. So those are three quick tips I have for you. Key takeaway, I say this all the time to bloggers I am not special. I started this with no previous blogging experience. It kind of blew up for me. I definitely will never say that my experience is typical, but I'm not special. If I can, you can. That is what I told myself the whole time when I was coming up. So, I'm going to always just tell others the same thing. If I can, you can. If they can, I can. I just kept reading stories of successful bloggers, and I just was -- I decided if they can, I can. So, if I can, you can. Now, the freebie I promised you, the 5 Best Affiliate Marketing Programs For Travel Bloggers. It is a free video training. If you head to my blog about blogging travelblogging101.com,

[00:26:47.210] - Shelley
it's going to be the first thing you see on that page. And you just enter your email and I'll send you the free course and it'll help get you started on affiliate marketing with the five programs I recommend joining. These are also the five most lucrative ones for me. So -- and I've had a lot of people tell me that these end up being their most lucrative as well. So thank you so much for attending the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, for attending this session. I hope you got a lot of takeaways on understanding affiliate marketing. I hope I demystified it, and I hope you get started doing it ASAP. You do not need to hit any made-up magic number. So, good luck, and if I can, you can.
